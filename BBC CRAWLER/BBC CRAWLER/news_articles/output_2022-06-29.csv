Mum told to stop breastfeeding at Sainsbury's,"Beth Coles said she had taken her daughter out as she did not want her to cry in the store A mum was left in tears after supermarket staff told her to stop breastfeeding her daughter in her car. Beth Coles, 25, took her baby Rosie for a feed when she became agitated in Sainsbury's in Kidderminster. She said she ""just burst out crying"" when an employee knocked on her car window and told her she was being ""inappropriate"". Sainsbury's offered its apologies in a statement for Ms Coles' ""unacceptable experience"". Ms Coles said the family had visited the shop on Friday evening on their way home from a day with her in-laws. ""We walked in and started doing our shopping, then our four-week-old child started crying,"" she told BBC Hereford and Worcester. ""I didn't want her to kick off in the store and didn't want to use their changing rooms so decided to take her out."" Rosie is just four weeks old She said she was covered in a blanket when she saw a female employee ""making a bee line"" for the car before knocking on the window. ""I opened it, thinking maybe I've dropped something, and she says 'can you not do that please, I think it's inappropriate'. ""I had no response, I just burst out crying."" Listen: Mum told to stop breastfeeding Ms Coles said the experience had left her not wanting to leave the house and made her conscious about breastfeeding. ""I just want to give it up,"" she said.  ""If that's the reaction from people that are supposed to be encouraging young mums, why bother?"" Women are encouraged to breastfeed and asking someone to leave a public place for breastfeeding is illegal. Julia Cooper,who successfully campaigned for it to be an offence to photograph a person breastfeedingwithout their consent, said she was appalled by what happened to Ms Coles. ""What people need to understand is the emotional impact of strangers observing and shaming you for breastfeeding - it's massive,"" she said. ""[Ms Coles] did everything she could to make other people feel comfortable, which isn't your job as a mother, but she did that and yet this person felt it was OK to police her body when she's doing the most natural thing and feeding her baby. ""It's appalling."" Sainsbury's insisted breastfeeding was welcome in its stores. A spokesperson said it was investigating and would deliver further training. In a statement, it said it had apologised to Ms Coles, who welcomed the apology. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

MPs' babies should be barred from Commons - review,"Stella Creasy sat in the Commons chamber with her son in September 2021 MPs should not bring their babies into the Commons chamber, a cross-party committee has said. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle asked the Procedure Committee to review the rules, after Labour's Stella Creasy was told in November 2021 she could not have her three-month-old son with her. The review concluded the ""long-standing practice"" of barring babies from Commons debates should remain in place. But it added some discretion should be exercised ""sparingly"". Ms Creasy expressed her disappointment in the findings. She had previously said it should be possible for ""parenting and politics possible to mix"". No babies allowed in Commons, MP told Commons chamber no place for a baby, says MP MP cradles baby on Commons benches ""This committee didn't speak to a single person outside Parliament, despite many of us encouraging them to do so,"" she said. ""So I'm not surprised they don't recognise who is put off Parliament by its antiquated rules. Change will only come when we start listening to those outside the status quo."" Conservative Karen Bradley, who chairs the committee, told MPs on Thursday ""people didn't think this was a place that was suitable for children"". ""Members wanted to be able to spend time with that new person and adjusting to being a new parent, and didn't want to feel any obligation to come here with a child because that was something that was becoming the norm."" Karen Bradley outlined the Procedure Committee's findings But she added babies could still be brought into the Commons when this was required ""in exceptional circumstances"", at the discretion of the chair and when agreed in advance. The issue was raised last November when Ms Creasy brought her young soninto a debate in Westminster Hall,which is part of the Houses of Parliament. The Labour MP said she had taken her son and, before him, her daughter into the Commons chamber. But she was emailed by Commons authorities telling her rules prohibited bringing children to debates. The Procedures Committee has concluded this ban should continue if the MP involved wants to ""observe, initiate, speak or intervene in proceedings"". However, it added that chairs would ""retain a degree of de facto discretion which should be exercised sparingly - the firm expectation should remain that members do not participate in proceedings while caring for a baby"". When the review was ordered, Conservative MP Alicia Kearns argued the Commons was ""no place"" for a baby. ""In no professional workplace would you feed your baby in a meeting with your chief executive, or in a pitch to new clients, or on a stage in front of shareholders."" The Rutland and Melton MP - who announced the birth of her second child in January 2021 - told the Commons on Thursday she was concerned that the discretion of the chair on this issue might be abused. She said ""the pressure I've come under during this period has been quite strong, and I fear that chairs of committees might feel that they have been forced to allow babies"". Former MP Jo Swinson is believed to have been the first MP to cradle a baby during a Commons debate in 2018 However the SNP's Kirsten Oswald said she feared retaining the guidance could lead to some people from diverse backgrounds or younger people being excluded from becoming MPs. Only Stella Creasy and Alicia Kearns spoke to the Procedures Committee about the rules on babies. Ms Bradley acknowledged that the atmosphere surrounding the debate on social media had been ""toxic"". The issues needed to be discussed in ""reasonable circumstances"", she said. In a BBC interview, Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""sympathetic"" to MPs wanting to be allowed to take their babies into the Commons. ""The House of Commons is a workplace, so I think you should judge each individual circumstance by itself and by the needs that there are. Families do have difficult questions to deal with in relation to childcare."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson is thought to have been the first MP to take her baby into the chamber during a debate, when she cradled her son in the Commons in 2018. The committee has also called for the extension of proxy voting from MPs on parental leave to those suffering from ""serious long-term illness"". Ms Bradley called for a debate to be held on this issue before the summer recess.

US to ramp up military presence across Europe,"The US president said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want The US will increase its military presence across Europe as Nato agreed a ""fundamental shift"" in its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A permanent army headquarters will be created in Poland, while new US warships will go to Spain, fighter jets to the UK and ground troops to Romania. Mr Biden said Nato was ""needed now more than it has ever been"". The alliance is having its biggest overhaul since the Cold War, Nato head Jens Stoltenberg said. The new plan in response to Russia's invasion will mean more than 300,000 troops at high readiness next year, up from the current level of 40,000. Mr Biden told a summit in Madrid that Nato would be ""strengthened in all directions across every domain - land, air and sea"". The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has also said it is significantly increasing the availability of forces to Nato's collective defence, with more warships, fighter jets and land forces on standby - although the MoD said it would not give details on numbers as they are ""militarily sensitive"". What is Nato and how is it changing? Five key challenges for Nato at critical summit The US announcement sees it shore up its presence across the continent but particularly in eastern Europe where the new permanent headquarters for its 5th Army Corps will be based. Mr Biden repeated the alliance's commitment to ""defend every inch"" of its territory, saying: ""We mean it when we say an attack against one is an attack against all."" The measures include: Boosting the fleet of US naval destroyers in Spain from four to six An additional ""rotational brigade in Romania consisting of 3,000 fighters and another 2,000-personnel combat team Two more squadrons of F-35 stealth jets to the UK Additional air defence and other capabilities in Germany and Italy. The UK has already nearly doubled the size of its military presence in Estonia, with just over 1,600 troops there. More will be allocated to the defence of the Baltics, however the MoD said these additional troops may be held at high readiness back home. At the summit Nato leaders agreed to accept the previously neutral Nordic statesFinland and Sweden into the alliance, with their membership needing to be ratified by the governments of all 30 Nato members. Mr Biden said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want and said his strategy of invading Ukraine had backfired. Nato Secretary General Mr Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had been formally invited to join the military alliance, describing it as the ""fastest accession process ever"", and said he expected the swift progress to continue. The two applicants must now show that they meet Nato's standards in politics, law, and in their armed forces - something which is expected to be relatively straightforward for the Nordic countries. Mr Stoltenberg said Ukraine could continue to count on the alliance's assistance in the face of Russian aggression for ""as long as it takes"", adding that Ukraine was fighting for its independence but also for values shared by Nato. He said member states had agreed a ""comprehensive assistance package"" for Ukraine, which included fuel, medical supplies, body armour, anti-drone systems and equipment to counter mines. Gone are the past mealy-mouthed references to Russia or China being partners. In an 11-page document, Nato's updatedStrategic Concept,externalexplains how the alliance views the threats facing western democracies and how it plans to deal with them. The Russian Federation, it says, is the most significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. We cannot consider it ""to be our partner"", it reads, but ""we remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow"" to prevent escalation. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China runs counter to Nato values and interests, the document explains. In reference to President Putin's repeated reminders that he's got a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, Nato points to its own formidable nuclear deterrent. If anyone used nuclear weapons against the alliance, the document says, then it has the capabilities and resolve to impose ""unacceptable"" costs on an adversary. But these circumstances, it adds, are ""extremely remote"". The document is short on detail of where Nato plans to place its reinforcements. But its door remains open to new members, it says, and in words that will further annoy the Kremlin: ""We will continue to develop our partnerships with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine."" The summit described a new guiding blueprint for the alliance which said that Russia was ""the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area"". It added that ""we cannot discount the possibility of an attack against allies' sovereignty and territorial integrity"". Mr Putin said he could not rule out that tensions would emerge between Russia and Sweden and Finland after they joined Nato and said Moscow would respond in kind if Nato infrastructure was set up in the countries. He said Nato leaders wanted to ""assert their supremacy, their imperial ambitions"" but also said Russia had ""no problem"" with Finland and Sweden joining the bloc.

Heinz pulls brands from Tesco shelves in price row,"Heinz has stopped supplying Tesco with some of the UK's family favourite products in a dispute over pricing. Baked beans, ketchup and tomato soup are among the cupboard staples missing from shelves in some Tesco stores. Kraft Heinz, which owns the brand, said its production costs were rising but it was working with Tesco to resolve the situation quickly. But Tesco said: ""We will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers."" ""We're sorry that this means some products aren't available right now,"" a Tesco spokesperson said. ""We hope to have this issue resolved soon."" Some Heinz items are already out of stock,according to the Grocer magazine,,externalwhich first reported the falling-out. In recent months food manufacturers have reported rising costs, including for energy and commodities, with some warning they would need to raise the prices they charge to retailers. However supermarkets such as Tesco are striving to keep prices low for customers facing a cost-of-living squeeze and shopping more carefully. Tesco removes Marmite and other Unilever brands in price row Poundland boosts Â£1 items in battle for shoppers People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise A Kraft Heinz spokesman said the pricing issue was down to ""today's challenging economic environment - with commodity and production costs rising"". He said the firm always looked at how it could ""provide value through price, size and packs.... at a price point that works within their budgets"". ""We are confident of a positive resolution with Tesco,"" he added. Meanwhile, a Tesco spokesperson said the supermarket giant was ""laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check"". ""With household budgets under increasing pressure, now more than ever we have a responsibility to ensure customers get the best possible value, and we will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers."" There are empty shelves in some stores and some Heinz items are also out of stock on Tesco's website Ged Futter, a former Asda executive and now director of consultancy The Retail Mind, said rows over prices were more common than customers realised. ""Heinz are saying if you're not prepared to take it [at that price] we will stop supply,"" he said. ""More manufacturers are saying that to retailers than ever before. I have examples of supplies being stopped in every single retailer except Aldi."" He said the reason the Heinz Tesco row had become obvious was because the products were so popular that shelves would have been empty within days of the supply being cut off. Manufacturers were absorbing unprecedented food price rises from retailers for the fourth or fifth time in the last 18 months, he said. ""There will be a resolution as Tesco can't afford not to have Heinz products and Heinz can't afford to not be in Tesco. It's just a matter of what that resolution looks like,"" he said. These products made by Unilever were taken off the Tesco website in 2016 after the manufacturer put up the prices Retail analyst Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said the issue was reminiscent of theMarmite saga of 2016. Marmite, PG Tips tea and Pot Noodles were taken off the Tesco website after Unilever put prices up. ""Despite rising cost prices, Tesco are right to use their scale and size to resist unilateral price increases, given that these rises will have to be passed on to customers. ""Larger suppliers like Heinz are significantly sized businesses in their own right and one would hope they were doing their bit to limit the scale of cost price increases, instead of merely passing them on,"" he said. Rising food prices have helped push inflation to a 40-year high and shoppers are already cutting back on the amount of food they buy, according to a survey for the Office for National Statistics. Tesco said it had seen signs of customers altering their behaviour in response to higher food prices, including shopping less frequently.Asda told the BBCshoppers were asking cashiers to stop checking out food when the total reached Â£30, to limit their spend.

UK Brexit legislation is a gun on the table - EU,"Loyalist graffiti attacking in Larne, Northern Ireland attacking the post-Brexit border checks The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has accused the UK of effectively putting ""a gun on the table"" by introducing a bill to scrap post-Brexit trade rules between Britain and Northern Ireland. Maros Å efÄoviÄ told an event in London the EU would not ""negotiate on the basis of this bill"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says it will ""fix"" border problems. But Mr Å efÄoviÄ said her plan was illegal, would create uncertainty and would not work. His speech came two days after MPs gave their initial approval to the government's Northern Ireland Protocol Bill. The proposed piece of legislation would allow ministers to change the part of the UK-EU 2019 deal - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - that introduced post-Brexit checks on goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Those were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland, but are unpopular among some unionists in Northern Ireland. This week, Ms Truss said the protocol had ""many practical problems"", and had created ""a growing sense that the rights and aspirations of some parts of the community are being undermined"". ""The protocol was not set in stone forevermore on signing,""she said.,external""It explicitly acknowledges the need for possible new arrangements in accordance with the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement."" Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? What's next for plans to override NI Protocol? Move to override Brexit deal gets backing from MPs The UK government wants to allow goods leaving Great Britain for Northern Ireland to avoid checks, providing they remain in Northern Ireland. Under the post-Brexit rules Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market and Mr Å efÄoviÄ argued it was ""not for London to unilaterally change the game and decide what enters the EU's single market"". On Monday evening MPs voted for the bill at the first stage by 295 votes to 221. Some Conservative MPs - including the former Prime Minister Theresa May - criticised the bill, arguing that it breached the agreement and therefore international law. Boris Johnson has suggested the bill could become law before the end of the year - however, it is likely to face fierce opposition in the House of Lords. Maros Å efÄoviÄ has been involved in Brexit talks since 2019 Addressing an event hosted by Bloomberg, Mr Å efÄoviÄ argued that the protocol, negotiated by the EU and UK, protected the peace process in Northern Ireland. ""The EU cannot - and will not - accept this delicate balance being unilaterally and illegally disapplied because of an outright U-turn by the UK government,"" he said. He did not elaborate on how the EU might respond to the UK's move. The Slovakian diplomat said it was ""simply unrealistic - and unfair - for London to expect that all barriers can be lifted when goods move to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK"". He argued that while he had tried to bring ""creative solutions"" to the table, the UK had adopted a ""my way or the highway approach"". He said the EU was ""ready to talk"" but added ""you are not going to negotiate when you have a gun on the table"". In contrast, Ms Truss has accused the EU of not showing enough ""flexibility"". She said the protocol had had a ""devastating impact"" on Northern Ireland and argued the UK had been left with ""no other choice"" but to take unilateral action. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Farmers cut food production as costs soar,"Lincolnshire farmer Andrew Ward told the BBC the food system in the UK is broken Farmers struggling with soaring costs are being forced to cut back on their food production, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU). It said some are at risk of going out of business. One farmer told the BBC the food system in the UK is ""broken"". A third of arable farmers told the NFU they're cutting back on crops for food. Many are switching from growing wheat for bread to wheat for animal feed, as it uses less fertiliser. The government said its schemes supported farmers. Fuel, animal feed, fertiliser and energy have all seen unprecedented price rises in recent months, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, putting financial pressure on farmers who cannot always pass those costs on to supermarkets and other customers. Fertiliser costs began to rise last autumn when the wholesale price of gas, which is needed to produce it, started to climb. The Ukraine conflict has made the situation worse, with sanctions hitting supplies from Russia, one of the world's biggest producers of some of the key ingredients in fertiliser. ""I've never known farming to be so volatile and so stressful,"" says Andrew Ward, who runs a 1,600-acre arable farm in Lincolnshire, growing wheat, barley and rapeseed. ""I get up in the morning and sometimes I wonder, 'why am I doing that?'"" he says. Andrew Ward has seen fertiliser and other costs skyrocket His energy bills have doubled, red diesel - used in his farm vehicles - is up around 200%, and he's seen a 400% increase in his fertiliser costs. He is considering using less fertiliser on his fields, which means a lower crop yield when it comes to the harvest. ""If the fertiliser is too expensive and it's not viable to apply the maximum amount, then the tonnes [of wheat] we'll get will be less, which means there'll be less food."" Food strategy criticised by government's own adviser UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Thousands of pigs culled due to butcher shortage Andrew is clear about what needs to change to make that happen. ""Our food system is broken. It's been too cheap for too long. Our costs are rocketing and I don't think it's right we should have to subsidise everybody's household spend on food. ""We have to make a living, we have to reinvest in the business and in the countryside, and that's not happening,"" he adds. The NFU surveyed 610 dairy farmers and 525 arable farmers. The survey found that 7% of dairy farmers are considering stopping milk production by 2024, which the union estimates could lead to 840 producers leaving the sector. Some dairy farmers say they may stop milk production in the next couple of years Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, says farming has always been a volatile sector, but price rises mean the decisions farmers are making now ""feel more like a gamble than ever before"". ""[Rising costs are] already having an impact on the food that we are producing as a nation as well as leading to a crisis of confidence among Britain's farmers,"" she says. ""These survey results clearly set out what we have to lose if nothing is done."" Farming analysts the Andersons Centre track ""agflation"", which measures the rising costs faced by farmers. Their latest data shows agflation stood at 25.3% in May, compared to 9% CPI inflation and 8.5% CPI food inflation. This month the government announced its food strategy for England, saying it was ""backing farmers"" with a pledge to increase domestic food supply. The strategy included a commitment to invest Â£270m in farming innovation to boost production and an ambition for 50% of public sector food spending to go on locally sourced produce. The NFU has welcomed the move, but says the sector needs further investment and commitment from the government. Pig farmers are also scaling back their production plans with the sector at crisis point. Thousands of pigs had to be culled and burnt late last yeardue to a shortage of skilled butchers and abattoir workers arriving from Europe since Brexit. Since then, fuel and pig feed price increases have hit farmers hard, with most producers unable to make a profit. Recent data from farming software provider Agrovision shows that the number of weeners - young pigs - has dropped by 23%. Many farmers are reducing their herds, or getting out of pig farming altogether. Oxfordshire farmer Tom Allen is losing up to Â£40 for every pig he produces ""We're losing Â£30-Â£40 on every pig we produce,"" says Tom Allen, a farmer from Oxfordshire, who has seen the cost of animal feed double over the last year. ""It's totally uneconomic."" He has reduced his pig herd by a third, and has had to make a number of people redundant. ""I've seen friends going out of business left, right and centre, with no way of knowing how they're going to generate an income for their families. It's terrifying,"" he says. He thinks it won't be long before consumers notice less choice in supermarkets. ""What this means is there will be a shortage of pig meat coming quite quickly. ""Prices will have to rise to cover our costs, let alone make a return on our investments. If it doesn't, there won't be any pig meat on the shelves at all, because the industry will just implode."" Tom says financial pressures are taking a toll on farmers' mental health, something that Amy Thomas from the Lincolnshire Rural Support Network has seen first-hand. The charity assists farmers and their families across the county. Last year, they helped 186 families in total. Since April this year, they've already assisted 120 farming families and expect that number to keep growing. Amy Thomas's Lincolnshire farm charity has helped 120 families already this year ""We're seeing a lot of business-related cases coming through. There's a lot of pressure on people at the moment. They're not quite sure where to turn. A lot of stress cases, and mental health cases,"" says Ms Thomas. ""People have come to us with problems around increased costs and problems securing labour, so it's a perfect storm."" She says farming is like few other industries, in that you cannot just quit when the going gets tough. ""Farms are workplaces and homes, and have often been in the family for generations. Nobody wants to be the person to say enough is enough, we're finished."" A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said it had taken steps to support farmers with the availability of fertiliser. ""We have announced that we will bring forward 50% of the Basic Payment Scheme payment to July to help ease cash flow pressures,"" they said. The government has also announced an additional 10,000 visas for the seasonal workers route, they added.

Charles suitcase of cash 'would not happen again',"The cash donation accepted by the Prince of Wales for his charity would not happen now, a royal source says. ""That was then, this is now,"" the source said, following reports Prince Charles had accepted around Â£2.5m in cash in a suitcase and carrier bags. ""It was passed immediately to his charity and it was his charity who decided to accept the money,"" said the senior royal source. The cash was from former Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim. The Charity Commission earlier this week said it was considering whether it needed to review the donation, with a decision still to be reached. The Sunday Times had reported that the donations, in three payments, had been made to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund between 2011 and 2015. Questions had been raised about such large donations being made in bank notes, but the senior royal source said that all the necessary checks and auditing processes had been carried out. Prince Charles charity funded hard-up former spies with Bond money Cash donation reports checked by watchdog Prince Charles reported to have accepted suitcase with million euros ""Situations, contexts change over the years,"" said the royal source. ""I can say with certainty that for more than half a decade, this has not happened and it would not happen again."" It's understood the cash was passed to Coutts bank to be given to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, with the charity making the decision to accept it. This echoes the response of Sir Ian Cheshire, chair of the charity, who had told the BBC that the ""optics"" of accepting so much cash did not look good, but that at the time it was not uncommon for wealthy people in the Middle Eastern to use large amounts of cash. He said that more recent money-laundering regulations would make itunlikely that large amounts of cash would now be offered or accepted. The billionaire donor of the cash, Sheikh Hamad, was the prime minister of the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar between 2007 and 2013. As head of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, he had been called ""the man who bought London"" after investments in landmark properties and businesses such as The Shard and Harrods. There are no rules against making cash donations to charities. But the Charity Commission has said it will consider the reports about the donations. ""We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter,"" said a spokeswoman for the charities regulator. The Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, one of several charities set up by Prince Charles, is no longer based at Clarence House, having changed address to other commercial premises in central London earlier this year. Earlier this week, former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker called the reported cash payments ""grubby and scuzzy"". He has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included intoongoing investigations into claims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities.

No strong case for changing abortion rules - Raab,"This video can not be played Rosie Duffield calls for the government to enshrine in law ""a woman's right to choose"". The right to abortions in the UK is ""settled"" and there is not a ""strong case for change"", Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said. The comments followa US decisionoverturning the right to abortion. In the Commons, Labour MP Rosie Duffield asked if the government's Bill of Rights would be amended to ""enshrine a woman's right to choose"". Mr Raab replied that abortion was an ""issue of conscience"" for MPs and that it was up to them to decide the law. Last week, judges on the USSupreme Court ruled in favour of Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks. Half of the country's states are now expected to introduce new restrictions or bans on the procedure. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland MP opens up about 'incredibly difficult' abortion Fresh calls for UK abortion clinic buffer zones Responding to the court's decision, Ms Duffield asked the deputy prime minister to send ""a clear signal...that Britain respects the rights of women, and will he accept the cross-party amendment to his forthcoming Bill of Rights which enshrines a woman's right to choose in law?"" The government's Bill of Rights -which is currently going through Parliament- sets out a framework for human rights and ministers say it would strengthen freedom of speech and ""restore common sense to our justice system"". Replying to the MP for Canterbury, Mr Raab said: ""The position, as she knows, is settled in UK law in relation to abortion. ""It's decided by honourable members [MPs] across this House. It's an issue of conscience. I don't think there is a strong case for change. ""What I wouldn't want to do is find ourselves, with the greatest of respect, in the US position where this is being litigated through the courts rather than settled as it is now settled by honourable members in this House."" Responding to Mr Raab, Labour MP Stella Creasy - who introduced the amendment on abortion -tweeted:,external""Why is the Bill of Rights good enough to protect your freedom of speech but not your womb from being interfered with?"" The abortion debate has ignited passions in US politics Abortion has been legal in Great Britain since 1967, when a new law allowed terminations up to 24 weeks in most circumstances - although this was not extended to Northern Ireland until 2020. On Tuesday, Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson warned that the law change in the US had give American anti-abortion groups the ""impetus"" to try to reverse the 1967 Abortion Act in Britain. She urged ministers to introduce more ""buffer zones"" around abortion clinics to prevent activists targeting patients and staff. Shadow foreign minister Amanda Milling said she shared the view of Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the Supreme Court's judgement was ""a big step backwards"". ""The UK is proud to defend and promote universal and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights, which is a fundamental to unlock the potential agency and freedom of women and girls,"" she said. Ms Milling added that buffer zones were a ""matter for the Home Office and is something that they keep under review"". What happens now Roe v Wade has been overturned? US women divided on abortion ruling The UK's first buffer zone was set up in the London borough of Ealing in 2018. Since then two more have been created in England, but campaigners have called for more to be set up. Speaking in the same debate, Conservative MP Danny Kruger said he would ""probably disagree"" with other MPs on the subject. ""They think that women have an absolute right to bodily autonomy in this matter, whereas I think in the case of abortion that right is qualified by the fact that another body is involved. ""I don't understand why we are lecturing the United States on a judgment to return the power of decision over this political question to the states, to democratic decision-makers, rather than leaving it in the hands of the courts,"" he added.

Murray makes earliest exit from Wimbledon,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: John Isner peppers Andy Murray with unplayable shots Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. British two-time champion Andy Murray suffered his earliest Wimbledon exit as he lost in four sets against American John Isner in the second round. The 35-year-old former world number one clinched the third set to keep alive his hopes but fell 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 to the big-hitting 20th seed. Isner, a 2018 semi-finalist, fired 36 aces on his way to an impressive victory on Centre Court. He will play 20-year-old Italian 10th seed Jannik Sinner next. Murray had never before failed to reach the third round at SW19, in 13 previous attempts. But he was unable to register a break of serve against the unwavering Isner, who executed his trademark big-serving game to perfection to record a memorable win, going out just hours afterBritish teenager Emma Raducanu lost to Caroline Garciaon the same court. Murray targets US Open seeding after Wimbledon exit Norrie wins in five sets to reach third round Feeding off an electric atmosphere to stay in the match, Murray punched the cooling air as a looping Isner return dropped wide to conclude the third set - the crowd rising to their feet to offer further encouragement. But then came the sucker punch. The Briton, ranked 52nd in the world, rescued one break point for deuce but a second chance proved one too many as 37-year-old Isner took a 3-2 lead in the fourth with the light beginning to fade at SW19. At 4-2, play was paused to allow the roof to be closed and, following the restart, the American delivered on serve to turn around a 0-30 deficit and move one game from victory. He was forced to serve out the contest and duly obliged - a love hold sealing a fitting end to an efficient display against the home favourite. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Andy Murray says it is difficult to plan ahead with metal hip Murray, whose Wimbledon preparations were disrupted by an abdominal injury, had come back to win his opening match against Australian James Duckworth on Monday in four sets. A fightback was once again required against an opponent he had beaten in all eight previous meetings, but Isner proved an insurmountable obstacle in their first contest on grass. It was the American who landed the first blow, drawing a couple of errors from the Scot as he broke to 15. A superb backhand winner was celebrated by the captivated crowd and helped Murray reach the first of two break-point opportunities in the following game, but a series of blistering serves ensured Isner escaped unharmed. Three comfortable holds of serve, two without conceding a point, enabled the world number 24 to secure the first set relatively untroubled. John Isner is now just four behind the record of 13,728 aces in Tour-level matches held by Ivo Karlovic In a tight second set, Murray took a moment to compose himself, head in hands, after missing a backhand down the line that would have given him a break point when leading 4-3. But with neither player faltering on serve, it fell to a tie-break to determine the extent of Murray's task. If he was to continue at SW19, he would have to come back from two sets down for the 11th time in his career. Twice forced to serve to stay in the tournament when trailing 5-4 and 6-5, Murray called upon his vast experience to twice hold serve to love and reach another tie-break. And while that one went his way, it was ultimately not to be for Murray and his faithful support as his 14th Wimbledon challenge met a premature end. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Isner was magnanimous towards his beaten opponent in his on-court interview, saying: ""I am most definitely not a better tennis player than Andy Murray, I might have just been a little better than him today. ""It was an incredible honour to play him on this court in front of this crowd. At the age I'm at now, I need to relish these moments. This was one of the biggest wins of my career. ""To play as well as I did against one of our greatest players ever was a huge accomplishment for me. He's a massive inspiration to each one of us in the locker room and we are so lucky to still have him around."" Three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe on Today at Wimbledon Murray has got to go all in now. What's he going to do - pick and choose and play every couple of months? I don't think that's going to happen. He wants to get back to a point where he's seeded at a tournament, where he's in the position where he feels that he's one of the big boys again. This is a guy who has been in 11 Grand Slam finals. This has got to be unbelievably difficult, what he's been going through the last four or five years. - and to watch Novak Djokovic do what he does, to see Rafa Nadal get to 22.

Council's Westminster plea to bypass road hold-up,"A one-mile (1.5km) Llanbedr bypass would take traffic away from the village and its narrow bridge A council is trying to bypass the hold on new road developments in Wales by getting help from Westminster. Gwynedd Council will bid for UK government cash to try and restore hopes of getting a new road built around a village in Snowdonia. The Welsh governmentwithdrew financial support last yearfor a Â£14m bypass around Llanbedr, citing climate change. But supporters ofa scheme first mooted 60 years agosaid a solution to traffic problems was needed. Wales' deputy minister for climate change, Lee Waters, said building more roads was not the way forward. All new road-building projects in Wales were frozen last yearwhile a review is carried out. Beautiful beaches fail to entice one job applicant Mountain path covered in human faeces, says guide Second homes hotspot council could buy empty houses The local authority is now seeking up to Â£40m as part of its share of the UK government'slevelling-up fund. The revised bypass is likely to cost substantially more than the scheme givenplanning permission from Snowdonia National Park in March 2020. It was proposed because ofsevere tailbacks during the summercaused by tourists. Nearby Shell Island is one of the biggest campsites in Europe, attracting 85,000 visitors a year The Welsh government U-turn came after a review of all new road schemes, with ministers accepting the conclusion of an independent panel that the Llanbedr bypass did not fit in with the government's transport and climate policy. Ministers in Cardiff Bay promised to divert its Â£3m share of the original proposal towards ""sustainable transport schemes"" in the area. Now the council has turned to the UK government's levelling-up fund, which replaced the European Union's structural funding. Gwynedd will be competing against authorities across the UK for a share of Â£4.8bn. Local councillors called for the bypass scheme to be revived after a person has hit by a vehicle last month Gwynedd Council's new plan includes a ""green corridor"" with cycle and walking routes and will be submitted to the cabinet in July. A spokesman said: ""The Ardudwy green corridor scheme aims to provide a package of measures that will offer local people and visitors options to travel in a more environmentally friendly way for work and pleasure in a rural area and boost the economy of south Gwynedd. ""The proposal is to submit an application, for approximately Â£40m, for the construction of a new road to bypass the village of Llanbedr."" Mr Waters said: ""We are all facing the same climate change emergency. ""If we are serious about tackling it, we can't go on building more and more road capacity for private vehicles. ""We remain committed to working with Gwynedd Council to deliver improvements at Llanbedr that are in line with our ambitious targets to address the climate emergency.""

Legacy of campaigner Deborah James 'will live on',"The cancer campaigner received a damehood for her fundraising work The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have paid tribute to cancer campaigner, broadcaster and former teacher, Dame Deborah James, who has died aged 40. They joined celebrities, politicians and people living with cancer in praising the ""inspirational and unfalteringly brave"" mother-of-two. She had been receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer at home, and had raised millions for cancer research. Dame Deborah's family said she was ""amazing"" and an ""inspiration"". They announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. ""We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,"" it said. She passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. Her family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to ""raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer"". ""Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring."" On Wednesday evening, Dame Deborah topped Â£7m of funds raised for research into specialised medicine for cancer patients. Deborah James 'taught us how to live and how to dieâ Tailored cancer care - Dame Deborah's fundraising legacy Dame Deborah James: The Last Dance An intimate tribute to Dame Deborah James. Following her death, we hear from friends, colleagues and fellow cancer patients as they celebrate her life and legacy. Watch on BBC iPlayer now. Writing on Twitter, Prince William and Catherine said: ""Deborah was an inspirational and unfalteringly brave woman whose legacy will live on."" Speaking from Madrid at a Nato summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Dame Deborah, describing her as ""an absolute inspiration"". ""I remember reading about her ages ago, just being incredibly moved by her account of her suffering but how it had actually driven her to do so much to raise awareness about bowel cancer,"" he said. The host of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast was first diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, and was given a damehood in May in recognition of her fundraising. Prince William visited her at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, to deliver it. He praised her tireless efforts and thanked her for giving hope to those living with the disease. For her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was surreal. ""You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,"" she said. A persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain Blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles Abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating Screening, run by the NHS,external, aims to detect bowel cancer at an early stage. It involves a home test kit, which looks for hidden blood in poo, being posted to you so you can complete it and send it back. But it's not available to everyone - only to those age groups most likely to benefit. Screening happens across the UK. In England, the age is being gradually lowered from over-60s to people aged 50 and over. In Scotland, screening starts from age 50. In Wales, it's for people aged 58-74. In Northern Ireland, it's for people over 60. If you are outside the screening age group where you live, you should still be aware of what bowel cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns.

Source:NHS UK,external Dame Deborah had a no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016. Signing off her finalpodcastin May, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. ""I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo."" Deborah James made a dame by William at her home Deborah James visits rose named for her at Chelsea A deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun newspaper and becoming a BBC broadcaster. But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left. ""My body just can't continue any more,"" she saidin a post on Instagram.,external Her podcast co-host, Lauren Mahon, said on Instagram ""there's only one Deborah James"" and asked to be given time beside a broken heart emoji. In a BBC documentary recorded before her friend's death, Ms Mahon said: ""Deb just has this ferocity in her to make a difference and to make sure that no one else suffers the same fate. ""Most people would have just run away from that, but Deb wanted to tell her story so that it wouldn't be anyone else's story,"" she said. Dame Deborah also launched a new fund - Bowelbabe - to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients. It surpassed Â£1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of Â£250,000 - and has now raised Â£7m. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher leaves a tremendous legacy behind her. BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital. He said the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness. He was struck by Dame Deborah's ""sheer generosity"", he said, and their chat was ""typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others"". Chef Ryan Riley became friends with Dame Deborah through his project Life Kitchen, which provides cookery lessons for people whose sense of taste has been affected by cancer treatment. Mr Riley said she offered people hope. ""She would be that voice online that wasn't as scared as they were and I think that really gave a lot of people a bit of comfort in a really difficult time."" he said. The chef said Dame Deborah's frankness forged a connection with people that was necessary to ""push the cancer community forward and bring awareness"".

TV presenter Lorraine Kelly became emotional as she paid tribute to her on her ITV morning show. She wore a pink jacket, the campaigner's favourite colour, and a T-shirt featuring the words ""Rebellious Hope"", which was her slogan. Fighting back tears, she said: ""We knew this was going to happen, but it still doesn't seem quite real."" She interviewed Steve Bland, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and was married to her former podcast co-host, BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in 2018. He told Lorraine that Tuesday night was ""very surreal"" and ""very numb"". Bland said the fact that Dame Deborah had known for five and a half years that her cancer was incurable made what she had achieved during that period ""even more remarkable"".

"US to ramp up military presence across EuropePresident Biden announces a strengthening by ""land, air and sea"" over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Europe","The US president said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want The US will increase its military presence across Europe as Nato agreed a ""fundamental shift"" in its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A permanent army headquarters will be created in Poland, while new US warships will go to Spain, fighter jets to the UK and ground troops to Romania. Mr Biden said Nato was ""needed now more than it has ever been"". The alliance is having its biggest overhaul since the Cold War, Nato head Jens Stoltenberg said. The new plan in response to Russia's invasion will mean more than 300,000 troops at high readiness next year, up from the current level of 40,000. Mr Biden told a summit in Madrid that Nato would be ""strengthened in all directions across every domain - land, air and sea"". The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has also said it is significantly increasing the availability of forces to Nato's collective defence, with more warships, fighter jets and land forces on standby - although the MoD said it would not give details on numbers as they are ""militarily sensitive"". What is Nato and how is it changing? Five key challenges for Nato at critical summit The US announcement sees it shore up its presence across the continent but particularly in eastern Europe where the new permanent headquarters for its 5th Army Corps will be based. Mr Biden repeated the alliance's commitment to ""defend every inch"" of its territory, saying: ""We mean it when we say an attack against one is an attack against all."" The measures include: Boosting the fleet of US naval destroyers in Spain from four to six An additional ""rotational brigade in Romania consisting of 3,000 fighters and another 2,000-personnel combat team Two more squadrons of F-35 stealth jets to the UK Additional air defence and other capabilities in Germany and Italy. The UK has already nearly doubled the size of its military presence in Estonia, with just over 1,600 troops there. More will be allocated to the defence of the Baltics, however the MoD said these additional troops may be held at high readiness back home. At the summit Nato leaders agreed to accept the previously neutral Nordic statesFinland and Sweden into the alliance, with their membership needing to be ratified by the governments of all 30 Nato members. Mr Biden said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want and said his strategy of invading Ukraine had backfired. Nato Secretary General Mr Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had been formally invited to join the military alliance, describing it as the ""fastest accession process ever"", and said he expected the swift progress to continue. The two applicants must now show that they meet Nato's standards in politics, law, and in their armed forces - something which is expected to be relatively straightforward for the Nordic countries. Mr Stoltenberg said Ukraine could continue to count on the alliance's assistance in the face of Russian aggression for ""as long as it takes"", adding that Ukraine was fighting for its independence but also for values shared by Nato. He said member states had agreed a ""comprehensive assistance package"" for Ukraine, which included fuel, medical supplies, body armour, anti-drone systems and equipment to counter mines. Gone are the past mealy-mouthed references to Russia or China being partners. In an 11-page document, Nato's updatedStrategic Concept,externalexplains how the alliance views the threats facing western democracies and how it plans to deal with them. The Russian Federation, it says, is the most significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. We cannot consider it ""to be our partner"", it reads, but ""we remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow"" to prevent escalation. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China runs counter to Nato values and interests, the document explains. In reference to President Putin's repeated reminders that he's got a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, Nato points to its own formidable nuclear deterrent. If anyone used nuclear weapons against the alliance, the document says, then it has the capabilities and resolve to impose ""unacceptable"" costs on an adversary. But these circumstances, it adds, are ""extremely remote"". The document is short on detail of where Nato plans to place its reinforcements. But its door remains open to new members, it says, and in words that will further annoy the Kremlin: ""We will continue to develop our partnerships with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine."" The summit described a new guiding blueprint for the alliance which said that Russia was ""the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area"". It added that ""we cannot discount the possibility of an attack against allies' sovereignty and territorial integrity"". Mr Putin said he could not rule out that tensions would emerge between Russia and Sweden and Finland after they joined Nato and said Moscow would respond in kind if Nato infrastructure was set up in the countries. He said Nato leaders wanted to ""assert their supremacy, their imperial ambitions"" but also said Russia had ""no problem"" with Finland and Sweden joining the bloc.

Murray makes earliest exit from WimbledonBritain's Andy Murray is knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round following defeat against John Isner.,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: John Isner peppers Andy Murray with unplayable shots Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. British two-time champion Andy Murray suffered his earliest Wimbledon exit as he lost in four sets against American John Isner in the second round. The 35-year-old former world number one clinched the third set to keep alive his hopes but fell 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 to the big-hitting 20th seed. Isner, a 2018 semi-finalist, fired 36 aces on his way to an impressive victory on Centre Court. He will play 20-year-old Italian 10th seed Jannik Sinner next. Murray had never before failed to reach the third round at SW19, in 13 previous attempts. But he was unable to register a break of serve against the unwavering Isner, who executed his trademark big-serving game to perfection to record a memorable win, going out just hours afterBritish teenager Emma Raducanu lost to Caroline Garciaon the same court. Murray targets US Open seeding after Wimbledon exit Norrie wins in five sets to reach third round Feeding off an electric atmosphere to stay in the match, Murray punched the cooling air as a looping Isner return dropped wide to conclude the third set - the crowd rising to their feet to offer further encouragement. But then came the sucker punch. The Briton, ranked 52nd in the world, rescued one break point for deuce but a second chance proved one too many as 37-year-old Isner took a 3-2 lead in the fourth with the light beginning to fade at SW19. At 4-2, play was paused to allow the roof to be closed and, following the restart, the American delivered on serve to turn around a 0-30 deficit and move one game from victory. He was forced to serve out the contest and duly obliged - a love hold sealing a fitting end to an efficient display against the home favourite. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Andy Murray says it is difficult to plan ahead with metal hip Murray, whose Wimbledon preparations were disrupted by an abdominal injury, had come back to win his opening match against Australian James Duckworth on Monday in four sets. A fightback was once again required against an opponent he had beaten in all eight previous meetings, but Isner proved an insurmountable obstacle in their first contest on grass. It was the American who landed the first blow, drawing a couple of errors from the Scot as he broke to 15. A superb backhand winner was celebrated by the captivated crowd and helped Murray reach the first of two break-point opportunities in the following game, but a series of blistering serves ensured Isner escaped unharmed. Three comfortable holds of serve, two without conceding a point, enabled the world number 24 to secure the first set relatively untroubled. John Isner is now just four behind the record of 13,728 aces in Tour-level matches held by Ivo Karlovic In a tight second set, Murray took a moment to compose himself, head in hands, after missing a backhand down the line that would have given him a break point when leading 4-3. But with neither player faltering on serve, it fell to a tie-break to determine the extent of Murray's task. If he was to continue at SW19, he would have to come back from two sets down for the 11th time in his career. Twice forced to serve to stay in the tournament when trailing 5-4 and 6-5, Murray called upon his vast experience to twice hold serve to love and reach another tie-break. And while that one went his way, it was ultimately not to be for Murray and his faithful support as his 14th Wimbledon challenge met a premature end. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Isner was magnanimous towards his beaten opponent in his on-court interview, saying: ""I am most definitely not a better tennis player than Andy Murray, I might have just been a little better than him today. ""It was an incredible honour to play him on this court in front of this crowd. At the age I'm at now, I need to relish these moments. This was one of the biggest wins of my career. ""To play as well as I did against one of our greatest players ever was a huge accomplishment for me. He's a massive inspiration to each one of us in the locker room and we are so lucky to still have him around."" Three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe on Today at Wimbledon Murray has got to go all in now. What's he going to do - pick and choose and play every couple of months? I don't think that's going to happen. He wants to get back to a point where he's seeded at a tournament, where he's in the position where he feels that he's one of the big boys again. This is a guy who has been in 11 Grand Slam finals. This has got to be unbelievably difficult, what he's been going through the last four or five years. - and to watch Novak Djokovic do what he does, to see Rafa Nadal get to 22. He's an all-time great also, Murray. This is rough for him. Isner rose to the occasion, big time.

Putin's cousin hit by new UK sanctions over Ukraine,"Anna Tsivileva is Russian President Vladimir Putin's first cousin once removed The UK has announced its newest wave of sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his cousin. The Foreign Office said Anna Tsivileva, Putin's cousin and president of a major mining firm, has been sanctioned. Vladimir Potanin, Russia's second richest man and key supporter of Putin's regime, was also sanctioned on Wednesday due to the war in Ukraine. The UK government said the sanctions were intended to ""weaken the Russian war machine"". The pair will be subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Ms Tsivileva, who runs prominent Russian coal mining company JSC Kolmar Group, significantly benefitted from her relationship with the president, the Foreign Office said. The UK government describes Vladimir Potanin as a key supporter of Vladimir Putin Mr Potanin, said to be worth $37.1 bn (Â£30.5 bn) according to Bloomberg, continues to amass wealth supporting Putin's regime, the UK says. The oligarch, who heads the world's largest refined nickel and palladium producer Nornickel, has acquired Russian bank Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bank in the period since the invasion of Ukraine. According to the reports, he moved his $300m superyacht to thesafe haven of Dubaias a precaution. The oligarch spent$2bn building the Rosa Khutor ski resortthat hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi - a project that he said would be his legacy, but that he hoped to get some of the money back from the Russian government. A UK government spokesperson said: ""As long as Putin continues his abhorrent assault on Ukraine, we will use sanctions to weaken the Russian war machine. ""Today's sanctions show that nothing and no one is off the table, including Putin's inner circle."" Vladimir Potanin's yacht has docked in al-Rashid port in Dubai this week A group of Russian individuals and companies have also been sanctioned for their involvement in supportingPresident Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. Russia will also be barred from accessing UK trusts services, which allow a person or business to manage the assets of another. The sanctions are the latest as part of a series imposed by the UK which has seen more than 1,000 people and over 120 businesses targeted. Three-quarters of foreign companies have reduced operations in Russia and nearly a quarter have completely withdrawn, according to the UK. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russia's economy buckles up for a bumpy ride Russians flee to Dubai to avoid sanctions It comes as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, in Madrid for a Nato summit, told the BBC that the UK must not become ""tired or fatigued"" in its support for Ukraine. She said: ""It's only possible to achieve a lasting peace, first of all, when Russia are pushed out of Ukraine, secondly, when Russia are held to account for the appalling war crimes that have taken place, and thirdly, when we know that future Russian aggression can be prevented, we must never allow this to happen again. ""And we must protect the future security of Europe."" She added she was also keen to help Taiwan defend itself, as China builds up its armed forces.

US beach returned to black owners after 98 years,"""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" said Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles Bruce A prime beachfront resort seized from its black owners nearly 100 years ago has been returned to their descendants by officials in Los Angeles. Bruce's Beach was purchased in 1912 to create a beach resort for black people at a time of racial segregation in southern California. Located in the desirable city of Manhattan Beach, it was forcibly taken by the local council in 1924. But on Tuesday, Los Angeles officials voted to return the land to the family. Willa and Charles Bruce bought the two lots of land for $1,225 in 1912. The beach is now worth an estimated $20m (Â£16.45m). Willatold a reporter at the time,external: ""Wherever we have tried to buy land for a beach resort, we have been refused, but I own this land and I am going to keep it."" Over the next decade, Bruce's Beach became a ""citadel for African Americans coming there for leisure from all over the rest of southern California,"" family spokesman Chief Duane ""Yellow Feather"" Shepardtold the BBC last year. But the local police department put up signs limiting parking to 10 minutes, and another local landowner put up no trespassing signs, forcing people to walk half a mile to reach the water, he said. When those measures failed to deter visitors, the local authorities seized the land under eminent domain laws - designed to let the government forcibly buy land needed for roads and other public buildings. Officials claimed they planned to build a park. That did not happen until many decades later, and the area remained vacant in the interim. On Tuesday, the motion to return the land acknowledged, ""it is well documented that this move was a racially motivated attempt to drive out the successful black business and its patrons"". A commemorative monument at the beach is often adorned with tributes - and a wedding photo of the pioneering Bruces The return is the result of a lengthy campaign and difficult process. The beach has for years featured a memorial plaque to Willa and Charles, and the state legislature had to pass a law to allow the return of the property. Now, the county will lease the land from the family for $413,000 a year - with a clause allowing the future purchase of the land for up to $20m plus costs,according to the lease agreement,external. ""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles said - calling it ""bittersweet"". ""It destroyed them financially. It destroyed their chance at the American Dream. I wish they could see what has happened today,"" he said. ""We hope this opens people's eyes to a part of American history that isn't talked about enough, and we think it's a step toward trying to right the wrongs of the past."" And the impact of the seizure is arguably still felt today, Mr Shepard has previously said. ""We were just ousted from that communityâ¦ there's only 1% representation of African Americans in Manhattan beach at this time,"" he said -a figure backed by the city's census data,external.

Charles cash donation 'would not happen again',"The cash donation accepted by the Prince of Wales for his charity would not happen now, a royal source says. ""That was then, this is now,"" the source said, following reports Prince Charles had accepted around Â£2.5m in cash in a suitcase and carrier bags. ""It was passed immediately to his charity and it was his charity who decided to accept the money,"" said the senior royal source. The cash was from former Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim. The Charity Commission earlier this week said it was considering whether it needed to review the donation, with a decision still to be reached. The Sunday Times had reported that the donations, in three payments, had been made to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund between 2011 and 2015. Questions had been raised about such large donations being made in bank notes, but the senior royal source said that all the necessary checks and auditing processes had been carried out. Prince Charles charity funded hard-up former spies with Bond money Cash donation reports checked by watchdog Prince Charles reported to have accepted suitcase with million euros ""Situations, contexts change over the years,"" said the royal source. ""I can say with certainty that for more than half a decade, this has not happened and it would not happen again."" It's understood the cash was passed to Coutts bank to be given to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, with the charity making the decision to accept it. This echoes the response of Sir Ian Cheshire, chair of the charity, who had told the BBC that the ""optics"" of accepting so much cash did not look good, but that at the time it was not uncommon for wealthy people in the Middle Eastern to use large amounts of cash. He said that more recent money-laundering regulations would make itunlikely that large amounts of cash would now be offered or accepted. The billionaire donor of the cash, Sheikh Hamad, was the prime minister of the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar between 2007 and 2013. As head of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, he had been called ""the man who bought London"" after investments in landmark properties and businesses such as The Shard and Harrods. There are no rules against making cash donations to charities. But the Charity Commission has said it will consider the reports about the donations. ""We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter,"" said a spokeswoman for the charities regulator. The Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, one of several charities set up by Prince Charles, is no longer based at Clarence House, having changed address to other commercial premises in central London earlier this year. Earlier this week, former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker called the reported cash payments ""grubby and scuzzy"". He has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included intoongoing investigations into claims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities.

"Fraudsters target under-35s on WhatsAppYounger age groups are targeted through WhatsApp and dating apps, banking industry group says.","People under 35 are becoming the ""prime target"" for scammers tricking them into transferring money through social media platforms including WhatsApp. A banking industry body said intelligence suggested younger people were particularly hit by scams that played on their trust. UK Finance also warned that energy bill deal and tax scams were becoming more common as the cost of living rises. Criminals were ""building on people's fears"" of rising prices, it said. The banking industry body said that while people of all age groups are falling victim to scams, ""it is younger age groups that are often the prime target"". ""Our research found that people under 35 are more likely than older age groups to have been targeted in an impersonation scam and be swayed to provide personal or financial information,"" it said. Data from Barclays this month also showed people aged 21-30 were the most likely age group to fall victim to scams, due to the the majority taking place on social media, shopping sites and dating apps. UK Finance added that con artists were targeting all age groups by exploiting ""weaknesses outside of the banking system"", through online and social media platforms. If you've had money taken from your account, or your bank details stolen and payments made, then you're protected by law. Ultimately your bank should refund that money so they have a big incentive to crack down on that type of crime. It's working, with a fall in the number of unauthorised transactions, and record amounts of theft prevented. The bad news for customers is that the area that is most difficult to police and prevent is the area of fraud that's growing fastest. If you are conned into making a payment, an investment, or a transfer, then you've not got the same legal financial protections. You should still get in touch with your bank immediately, they may be able to chase the payment, possibly return it, and some will make good-will money back gestures, but they are not obliged to. With younger people being targeted more by these types of scams, and often more likely to fall for them, it's worth repeating the advice to just think for an extra second. Pause those speedy fingers, and don't give your details straight away. The type of scams criminals were using against people was evolving, the industry body said. Fake delivery texts asking for payment or NHS Covid-19 pass scams during the height of the pandemic were now being replaced by schemes focusing on cost-of-living challenges, it said. Criminals were now posing as different organisations ranging from the NHS, to banks and government departments via phone calls, text messages, emails, fake websites and social media posts. A type of fraud where people were duped into sending money and personal details surged 39% in 2021 compared with 2020 to Â£583m, UK finance said. This kind of fraud, known as Authorised Push Payment fraud (APP) - when victims think they are paying a genuine organisation - is on the rise, and outstripped fraud losses on bank and credit cards, which fell by 7% in 2021, for the first time. 'Fraudsters stole everything, even my house' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' However, less than half (47%) of the Â£246.8m worth of losses were returned to victims of APP fraud. The banking trade body said impersonation scams, along with investment and so-called ""romance"" scams were the ""most pernicious and prevalent"". Investment fraud cases surged by 57% and impersonation scams rose 36% on 2020. Investment scams, where a criminal convinces their victim to move their money to a fictitious fund or to pay for a fake investment, accounted for the largest proportion of losses APP crime in 2021, with losses increasing by 60% to Â£166.2m. Meanwhile, money lost through so-called romance scams, where the victim is persuaded to make a payment to a person they have met, often through social media or dating websites, and with whom they believe they are in a relationship, more than doubled in 2021 to Â£30.6m. Payment service providers were only able to return Â£12.6m - 41% - of the losses from romance scams, mainly because payments were made over an extended period of time and criminals had moved money by the time the crime was reported. Overall, Â£1.3bn, the most on record, was stolen through fraud in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the scale at which people were experiencing authorised push payment scams was ""shocking"". ""Yet all too often victims face a reimbursement lottery depending on who they bank with,"" she said. ""The government has announced its intention to enable mandatory reimbursement for bank transfer victims who are not at fault and this needs to be brought in as soon as possible."" TSB told the BBC it refunded 98% of its fraud cases in 2021, compared to 47% across all banks. Paul Davis, director of fraud prevention at TSB, said it was ""disappointing that the industry's fraud refund rate has barely increased with over half the money stolen by fraudsters still not refunded to victims - at a time when people's finances are already squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis"". Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said there had also been a hike in investment scams where criminals set up fake cryptocurrency websites featuring celebrities supposedly endorsing them on social media. She said upcoming legislation - the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill - provided an opportunity for the government ""to give new powers on information sharing and tracking stolen money"". ""These are things we have long called for and will support efforts to work together and stop the fraud happening in the first place,"" she added. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, a specialist police unit that targets the organised criminal gangs behind fraud, prevented Â£101m of fraud in 2021 - the largest amount in the unit's 20-year history, UK Finance said. The industry body is urging customers to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, and remember that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police. People should contact their bank immediately if they think they have been conned and report it to Action Fraud. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Heinz pulls brands from Tesco shelves in price rowThe beans, sauce and soup-maker is pausing supply to the UK's largest supermarket in a wrangle over price rises.","Heinz has stopped supplying Tesco with some of the UK's family favourite products in a dispute over pricing. Baked beans, ketchup and tomato soup are among the cupboard staples missing from shelves in some Tesco stores. Kraft Heinz, which owns the brand, said its production costs were rising but it was working with Tesco to resolve the situation quickly. But Tesco said: ""We will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers."" ""We're sorry that this means some products aren't available right now,"" a Tesco spokesperson said. ""We hope to have this issue resolved soon."" Some Heinz items are already out of stock,according to the Grocer magazine,,externalwhich first reported the falling-out. In recent months food manufacturers have reported rising costs, including for energy and commodities, with some warning they would need to raise the prices they charge to retailers. However supermarkets such as Tesco are striving to keep prices low for customers facing a cost-of-living squeeze and shopping more carefully. Tesco removes Marmite and other Unilever brands in price row Poundland boosts Â£1 items in battle for shoppers People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise A Kraft Heinz spokesman said the pricing issue was down to ""today's challenging economic environment - with commodity and production costs rising"". He said the firm always looked at how it could ""provide value through price, size and packs.... at a price point that works within their budgets"". ""We are confident of a positive resolution with Tesco,"" he added. Meanwhile, a Tesco spokesperson said the supermarket giant was ""laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check"". ""With household budgets under increasing pressure, now more than ever we have a responsibility to ensure customers get the best possible value, and we will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers."" There are empty shelves in some stores and some Heinz items are also out of stock on Tesco's website Ged Futter, a former Asda executive and now director of consultancy The Retail Mind, said rows over prices were more common than customers realised. ""Heinz are saying if you're not prepared to take it [at that price] we will stop supply,"" he said. ""More manufacturers are saying that to retailers than ever before. I have examples of supplies being stopped in every single retailer except Aldi."" He said the reason the Heinz Tesco row had become obvious was because the products were so popular that shelves would have been empty within days of the supply being cut off. Manufacturers were absorbing unprecedented food price rises from retailers for the fourth or fifth time in the last 18 months, he said. ""There will be a resolution as Tesco can't afford not to have Heinz products and Heinz can't afford to not be in Tesco. It's just a matter of what that resolution looks like,"" he said. These products made by Unilever were taken off the Tesco website in 2016 after the manufacturer put up the prices Retail analyst Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said the issue was reminiscent of theMarmite saga of 2016. Marmite, PG Tips tea and Pot Noodles were taken off the Tesco website after Unilever put prices up. ""Despite rising cost prices, Tesco are right to use their scale and size to resist unilateral price increases, given that these rises will have to be passed on to customers. ""Larger suppliers like Heinz are significantly sized businesses in their own right and one would hope they were doing their bit to limit the scale of cost price increases, instead of merely passing them on,"" he said. Rising food prices have helped push inflation to a 40-year high and shoppers are already cutting back on the amount of food they buy, according to a survey for the Office for National Statistics. Tesco said it had seen signs of customers altering their behaviour in response to higher food prices, including shopping less frequently.Asda told the BBCshoppers were asking cashiers to stop checking out food when the total reached Â£30, to limit their spend.

"Putin's cousin hit by new UK sanctions over UkraineSanctions against Anna Tsivileva will help weaken the Russian war machine, the UK's foreign office says.UK","Anna Tsivileva is Russian President Vladimir Putin's first cousin once removed The UK has announced its newest wave of sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his cousin. The Foreign Office said Anna Tsivileva, Putin's cousin and president of a major mining firm, has been sanctioned. Vladimir Potanin, Russia's second richest man and key supporter of Putin's regime, was also sanctioned on Wednesday due to the war in Ukraine. The UK government said the sanctions were intended to ""weaken the Russian war machine"". The pair will be subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Ms Tsivileva, who runs prominent Russian coal mining company JSC Kolmar Group, significantly benefitted from her relationship with the president, the Foreign Office said. The UK government describes Vladimir Potanin as a key supporter of Vladimir Putin Mr Potanin, said to be worth $37.1 bn (Â£30.5 bn) according to Bloomberg, continues to amass wealth supporting Putin's regime, the UK says. The oligarch, who heads the world's largest refined nickel and palladium producer Nornickel, has acquired Russian bank Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bank in the period since the invasion of Ukraine. According to the reports, he moved his $300m superyacht to thesafe haven of Dubaias a precaution. The oligarch spent$2bn building the Rosa Khutor ski resortthat hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi - a project that he said would be his legacy, but that he hoped to get some of the money back from the Russian government. A UK government spokesperson said: ""As long as Putin continues his abhorrent assault on Ukraine, we will use sanctions to weaken the Russian war machine. ""Today's sanctions show that nothing and no one is off the table, including Putin's inner circle."" Vladimir Potanin's yacht has docked in al-Rashid port in Dubai this week A group of Russian individuals and companies have also been sanctioned for their involvement in supportingPresident Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. Russia will also be barred from accessing UK trusts services, which allow a person or business to manage the assets of another. The sanctions are the latest as part of a series imposed by the UK which has seen more than 1,000 people and over 120 businesses targeted. Three-quarters of foreign companies have reduced operations in Russia and nearly a quarter have completely withdrawn, according to the UK. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russia's economy buckles up for a bumpy ride Russians flee to Dubai to avoid sanctions It comes as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, in Madrid for a Nato summit, told the BBC that the UK must not become ""tired or fatigued"" in its support for Ukraine. She said: ""It's only possible to achieve a lasting peace, first of all, when Russia are pushed out of Ukraine, secondly, when Russia are held to account for the appalling war crimes that have taken place, and thirdly, when we know that future Russian aggression can be prevented, we must never allow this to happen again.

Scottish indyref push 'could lead to Welsh vote',"A Welsh independence march is taking place on Saturday Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has claimed Wales could have a ""path"" to an independence vote if Scotland can hold one without Westminster's permission. The Scottish government is asking the Supreme Court to rule on plans fora referendum in 2023. Mr Price said UK government plans to repeal a Senedd law on trade unions strengthens the case for a Welsh vote. But First Minister Mark Drakeford says a pro-independence party would need to win a majority of votes first. The Welsh Conservatives said independence was ""convincingly defeated at the ballot box"" at the last Senedd election, when Plaid Cymru came third, while Lib Dems warned leaving the UK would ""hurt the poorest in Welsh society the hardest"". On Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon proposed 19 October 2023 as the date for a second referendum on independence. But with the UK government reluctant to hold a second vote, her Scottish government is asking the Supreme Court to rule on whether ministers in Edinburgh can hold a vote without the approval of the UK government first. The last referendum in 2014 took place following an agreement between the SNP government of the time, and former prime minister David Cameron. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price says a Scottish move to hold an independence referendum could lay a ""path"" for Wales to have its own vote Plaid Cymru promised a Welsh independence referendumat the Senedd election. Speaking onBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme, Adam Price said: ""If the Supreme Court decides in favour, we in Wales will have a route to go directly to the people of Wales in order to have a mandate for securing our own right to self-determination as a nation."" He said theUK government's proposal to repeal a Senedd law that bans agency workers filling in for strike action in the NHS and other Welsh public servicesstrengthens the case for such a vote. Mr Price accused the UK government of showing ""contempt"" for devolution, and called on independence supporters to ensure Wrexham's march for independence on Saturday is ""the biggest ever"". On Tuesday he challenged Mark Drakeford, during First Minister's Questions, to ""request the power for a referendum on the future of our democracy"". Mr Drakeford told Plaid Cymru's leader: ""If a party that stands for that at an election wins a majority of votes in Wales, then of course that referendum should happen."" But he added that the case Mr Price was making was ""fatally weakened"" by the fact that no political party promising such a referendum had won the majority of votes. UK ministers to scrap trade union rules in Wales Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 for referendum Is there a mandate for a Scottish independence referendum? Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""Even in the unlikely situation that the Supreme Court decides that the Scottish Parliament can have a legitimate referendum - even though it completely ignores the one from eight years ago - it does not mean the legal principles would automatically apply in Wales. ""And even if they, did Adam Price is very welcome to put that to the people of Wales where he will continue to demonstrate how out of touch he and his Party is with the Welsh people. ""Independence was convincingly defeated at the ballot box only last year - good luck to him in his world of denial."" On the trade union legislation, Mr Davies said the UK Conservative government is ""acting to protect public access to services"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said she that while agreed with the ""outrage"" over ""Westminster's latest power grab, an independence referendum would only bring more division to an already divided country and take away focus from more pressing political issues"". ""Independence, like Brexit would hurt the poorest in Welsh society the hardest,"" she added. Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 for referendum Will there be another Scottish independence referendum?

'Just be you' - Jervis opens up about being gay,"This video can not be played I want them to know the real Dan - Jervis Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July-8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app ""It took 24 years to be who I was, but now I'm happy. I look in the mirror and I like who I am."" A broad grin spreads across Dan Jervis' face as he says those words. Fresh from competing at the World Championships in Budapest, the Welsh distance swimmer is weeks away from his third consecutive Commonwealth Games. In Birmingham, he'll look to add a 1500m freestyle gold to the bronze won in Glasgow in 2014, and the silver earned on the Gold Coast four years ago. The self-described 'Valley boy' will go into the Games full of confidence - having reached the 1500m final on his Olympic debut in Tokyo last year, finishing fifth. But his positivity has been driven as much by changes in his personal life as events in the pool - with Jervis now ready to talk publicly for the first time about the fact he is gay. In two exclusive interviews with theBBC's LGBT Sport Podcastand BBC Sport Wales, Jervis shares his story. The LGBT Sport Podcast: The One with Dan Jervis Jervis took Commonwealth Games silver in 2018, with Australia winning gold through Jack McLoughlin and bronze thanks to Mack Horton In the small village of Resolven where Jervis grew up, rugby rules. But from the moment his grandparents took him to the local pool, swimming was the sport for him. ""My claim to fame is that I could do 10 metres without armbands when I was one,"" Jervis laughs. ""Swimming was my interest. It was the thing I'd gelled to and felt safe in, and I loved that when I went to school, there weren't any other swimmers I knew of. This sounds so bad, but I wasn't the most academic and I loved having something that I was better at than the others. ""If you'd asked me 18 years ago, my dream was always to go to the Olympics and win an Olympic gold medal - and it still is now."" The Welshman achieved the first part of that dream in 2021, although as all the Olympians in Tokyo found, preparation wasn't easy. As the Covid pandemic caused the Games to be delayed for a year, Jervis had to adapt his training. ""It was probably the most stressful few months of my entire life,"" Jervis admits. ""The pools had shut, I'd moved home to my parents and was using the spin bike in the garage - and then when things eased, I was training in a lake. I don't know how everyone did it, but you just do, and if you've got a goal, you'll find a way to get to it. ""I remember standing in Tokyo, ready to walk out, hearing them welcoming the athletes for the Olympic 1500m freestyle final. My whole life had built towards that exact moment, and I remember thinking to just take it in. ""With an Olympics, you never know if it'll happen again, and I remember everything about it."" Until today, that's been the Jervis the world knew - a proud Welshman, an Olympian, and one of Britain's top swimming stars. Now he's ready to talk about the fact he's gay as well. ""Everyone's journey is different, but I think I've always known,"" Jervis says. ""It was something in the back of my mind, bugging me. I thought I was bisexual and had girlfriends that I loved - but it came to about three years ago where I knew I had to deal with this. ""It wasn't affecting my swimming, but me as a human being. It sounds quite drastic, but I wasn't enjoying my life. Yeah, I was smiling, but there was something missing to make me properly happy."" And so, over a long period of time, Jervis began telling those closest to him about his sexuality. As he says himself, at the age of 24 he finally started to be who he was. He confided in a counsellor he'd known for years - and then it was his best friend, as they watched TV on the sofa. ""At that point, I'd never said the words out loud to myself,"" Jervis, now 26, admits. ""I said to her: 'I think I'm gay.' I couldn't even say: 'I'm gay.' It was stillâ¦ I couldn't say it. I was basically punching the words out. ""She was quite shocked but great, and it was exactly the reaction I wanted. I've had all good reactions, and the way I've described it is I'm not going to change as a person. ""I'm still the Dan you've always known. You just know something else about me now."" Jervis is set to compete in the 400m and 1500m freestyle for Wales in Birmingham It's been the stories of previous guests on the BBC's LGBT Sport Podcast that have, in part, inspired Jervis to talk publicly about his sexuality. ""Michael Gunning is a swimmer and an absolute legend, and he said I should come on to this show. I messaged hammer thrower Osian Jones about it as well,"" Jervis says. ""I also heard Mark Foster say on your podcast that he wanted to add his weight to making people's lives better, and I feel that as well. When I was younger in swimming, I wasn't aware of any out swimmers so didn't have anyone I could look to who was like me. I want to be that person for someone."" 'I want people to know I'm part of the LGBTQ+ community' - Osian Jones What ex-Olympic swimmer Mark Foster learned from coming out at 47 It's not just in the world of sport where Jervis is hoping he can be that role model. ""I'm a devout Christian,"" the Welshman says. ""I love God, and out of all the things in my life my faith is what I'm most proud of. And there is this thing where people say you can't be Christian and gay together, and I was sitting there knowing you can be because I am!"" And so, in many ways, Jervis' story is about owning the different parts of what makes him who he is - his Welshness, his faith, his sexuality, his sporting success - and showing that none of those things are contradictory. ""It took me 24 years to be who I am,"" he says. ""I was adjusting to everything else, just trying to fit in - until I thought: 'Just be you.' ""You know, we're just before the Commonwealth Games and there are going to be kids and adults watching who will know that I'm like them, and that I'm proud of who I am. ""And for so long, I hated who I was - and you see it all the time, people who are dying over this. They hate themselves so much that they're ending their lives. ""So if I can just be that someone people can look at and say, 'yeah, they're like me,' then that's good."" Dan Jervis was speaking exclusively to the BBC's LGBT Sport Podcast and BBC Wales Sport.

Mum told to stop breastfeeding at Sainsbury'sBeth Coles says she burst into tears after being approached by staff while feeding in her car.,"Beth Coles said she had taken her daughter out as she did not want her to cry in the store A mum was left in tears after supermarket staff told her to stop breastfeeding her daughter in her car. Beth Coles, 25, took her baby Rosie for a feed when she became agitated in Sainsbury's in Kidderminster. She said she ""just burst out crying"" when an employee knocked on her car window and told her she was being ""inappropriate"". Sainsbury's offered its apologies in a statement for Ms Coles' ""unacceptable experience"". Ms Coles said the family had visited the shop on Friday evening on their way home from a day with her in-laws. ""We walked in and started doing our shopping, then our four-week-old child started crying,"" she told BBC Hereford and Worcester. ""I didn't want her to kick off in the store and didn't want to use their changing rooms so decided to take her out."" Rosie is just four weeks old She said she was covered in a blanket when she saw a female employee ""making a bee line"" for the car before knocking on the window. ""I opened it, thinking maybe I've dropped something, and she says 'can you not do that please, I think it's inappropriate'. ""I had no response, I just burst out crying."" Listen: Mum told to stop breastfeeding Ms Coles said the experience had left her not wanting to leave the house and made her conscious about breastfeeding. ""I just want to give it up,"" she said.  ""If that's the reaction from people that are supposed to be encouraging young mums, why bother?"" Women are encouraged to breastfeed and asking someone to leave a public place for breastfeeding is illegal. Julia Cooper,who successfully campaigned for it to be an offence to photograph a person breastfeedingwithout their consent, said she was appalled by what happened to Ms Coles. ""What people need to understand is the emotional impact of strangers observing and shaming you for breastfeeding - it's massive,"" she said. ""[Ms Coles] did everything she could to make other people feel comfortable, which isn't your job as a mother, but she did that and yet this person felt it was OK to police her body when she's doing the most natural thing and feeding her baby. ""It's appalling."" Sainsbury's insisted breastfeeding was welcome in its stores. A spokesperson said it was investigating and would deliver further training.

"Steel import tariffs extended for two yearsControls have been extended because of ""global disruptions"" to energy markets, the government says.BusinessComments","Tariffs on steel imports that were due to expire will be retained for a further two years, the government said. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the plans departed from the UK's ""international legal obligations"" but was in the ""national interest"" to protect steel makers. She added the decision was made due to ""global disruptions"" to energy markets and supply chains. British steel producers are under pressure from soaring energy prices. Steelmaking is a key industry for some parts of the UK, where it employs 34,000 people and turns over Â£2bn annually. Without controls the government has warned the supply of steel into the UK could rise substantially, harming local manufacturers. UK Steel previously said ending the import controls could cause as much as Â£150m a year in damage. Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany at the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect metal manufacturers. But there were concerns such a decision could breach international law as the question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. Ms Trevelyan said the decision ""departs from our international legal obligations"" of a WTO agreement. ""However, from time to time, issues may arise where the national interest requires action to be taken,"" she added. The limits on steel imports were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. The restrictions, which add a tax to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. Mr Johnson said: ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy."" The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories were set to expire on 30 June, before the government extended them for two years. Steelmaking accounts for just 0.1% of the UK economy - but the material being used in crucial sectors, from defence to transport, means that it's considered an important industry to shelter from cheaper imports. That's why the EU applied tariffs to some types of foreign steel, primarily on steel from China, in 2018, when the UK was a member. Now the UK has chosen to roll over many of those controls. The move, which has been expected for some months, was reported as one reason for the resignation of the Prime Minister's ethics adviser Lord Geidt - but he later dismissed the issue as a ""distraction"". The Trade Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan admits the extension of tariffs could be at odds with World Trade Organization rules - but claims it reflects exceptionally challenging times for the industry, especially in light of high energy costs. She has consulted other countries in the hope of avoiding a challenge, in the process attracting controversy for missing a parliamentary hearing on the Australian trade deal. With the EU and US also retaining similar tariffs, it underlines the tough choices between removing trade barriers, and protecting national businesses. Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director of the steelworkers' union Community, welcomed the extension saying it was ""extremely important"". ""Government made the right call because giving up our safeguards, when the EU and US are maintaining theirs, would leave us exposed to import surges threatening thousands of jobs,"" he said. Ms Trevelyan said maintaining tariffs would help defend a strategic industry and that British steel producers could face ""serious injury"" were the measures not maintained. ""The government is therefore actively engaged with interested parties, including those outside the UK on the future of the UK safeguards and has listened to the concerns raised,"" she added. The largest British trade body representing the industry, UK Steel, said the measures were ""absolutely vital to the long-term health of the steel industry in the UK"". ""Deficient or absent safeguards measures risk trade diversion away from shielded markets elsewhere, resulting in surges of imports into the UK,"" said Richard Warren, head of policy and external affairs at UK Steel. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: ""The extension of safeguards will come as a welcome relief to the steel sector. ""It is not anti-competitive to provide a level playing field for our steel industry,"" he said. ""I also support the decision to exclude Ukrainian steel."" But some criticised the move, saying it would stifle the supply of much-needed steel not produced in the UK. Despite being a ""step in the right direction,"" the Confederation of British Metalworkers boss Steve Morley said, the tariffs raise the ""very real prospect of lost orders and production being moved away from the UK."" ""British steel mills have not been able to supply the... materials our members need to support critical domestic and export supply chains, nor are they likely to be able to do so in the near future,"" he said.

Fraudsters target under-35s on WhatsApp,"People under 35 are becoming the ""prime target"" for scammers tricking them into transferring money through social media platforms including WhatsApp. A banking industry body said intelligence suggested younger people were particularly hit by scams that played on their trust. UK Finance also warned that energy bill deal and tax scams were becoming more common as the cost of living rises. Criminals were ""building on people's fears"" of rising prices, it said. The banking industry body said that while people of all age groups are falling victim to scams, ""it is younger age groups that are often the prime target"". ""Our research found that people under 35 are more likely than older age groups to have been targeted in an impersonation scam and be swayed to provide personal or financial information,"" it said. Data from Barclays this month also showed people aged 21-30 were the most likely age group to fall victim to scams, due to the the majority taking place on social media, shopping sites and dating apps. UK Finance added that con artists were targeting all age groups by exploiting ""weaknesses outside of the banking system"", through online and social media platforms. If you've had money taken from your account, or your bank details stolen and payments made, then you're protected by law. Ultimately your bank should refund that money so they have a big incentive to crack down on that type of crime. It's working, with a fall in the number of unauthorised transactions, and record amounts of theft prevented. The bad news for customers is that the area that is most difficult to police and prevent is the area of fraud that's growing fastest. If you are conned into making a payment, an investment, or a transfer, then you've not got the same legal financial protections. You should still get in touch with your bank immediately, they may be able to chase the payment, possibly return it, and some will make good-will money back gestures, but they are not obliged to. With younger people being targeted more by these types of scams, and often more likely to fall for them, it's worth repeating the advice to just think for an extra second. Pause those speedy fingers, and don't give your details straight away. The type of scams criminals were using against people was evolving, the industry body said. Fake delivery texts asking for payment or NHS Covid-19 pass scams during the height of the pandemic were now being replaced by schemes focusing on cost-of-living challenges, it said. Criminals were now posing as different organisations ranging from the NHS, to banks and government departments via phone calls, text messages, emails, fake websites and social media posts. A type of fraud where people were duped into sending money and personal details surged 39% in 2021 compared with 2020 to Â£583m, UK finance said. This kind of fraud, known as Authorised Push Payment fraud (APP) - when victims think they are paying a genuine organisation - is on the rise, and outstripped fraud losses on bank and credit cards, which fell by 7% in 2021, for the first time. 'Fraudsters stole everything, even my house' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' However, less than half (47%) of the Â£246.8m worth of losses were returned to victims of APP fraud. The banking trade body said impersonation scams, along with investment and so-called ""romance"" scams were the ""most pernicious and prevalent"". Investment fraud cases surged by 57% and impersonation scams rose 36% on 2020. Investment scams, where a criminal convinces their victim to move their money to a fictitious fund or to pay for a fake investment, accounted for the largest proportion of losses APP crime in 2021, with losses increasing by 60% to Â£166.2m. Meanwhile, money lost through so-called romance scams, where the victim is persuaded to make a payment to a person they have met, often through social media or dating websites, and with whom they believe they are in a relationship, more than doubled in 2021 to Â£30.6m. Payment service providers were only able to return Â£12.6m - 41% - of the losses from romance scams, mainly because payments were made over an extended period of time and criminals had moved money by the time the crime was reported. Overall, Â£1.3bn, the most on record, was stolen through fraud in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the scale at which people were experiencing authorised push payment scams was ""shocking"". ""Yet all too often victims face a reimbursement lottery depending on who they bank with,"" she said. ""The government has announced its intention to enable mandatory reimbursement for bank transfer victims who are not at fault and this needs to be brought in as soon as possible."" TSB told the BBC it refunded 98% of its fraud cases in 2021, compared to 47% across all banks. Paul Davis, director of fraud prevention at TSB, said it was ""disappointing that the industry's fraud refund rate has barely increased with over half the money stolen by fraudsters still not refunded to victims - at a time when people's finances are already squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis"". Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said there had also been a hike in investment scams where criminals set up fake cryptocurrency websites featuring celebrities supposedly endorsing them on social media. She said upcoming legislation - the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill - provided an opportunity for the government ""to give new powers on information sharing and tracking stolen money"". ""These are things we have long called for and will support efforts to work together and stop the fraud happening in the first place,"" she added. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, a specialist police unit that targets the organised criminal gangs behind fraud, prevented Â£101m of fraud in 2021 - the largest amount in the unit's 20-year history, UK Finance said. The industry body is urging customers to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, and remember that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police. People should contact their bank immediately if they think they have been conned and report it to Action Fraud. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Putin's cousin hit by new UK sanctions over UkraineSanctions against Anna Tsivileva will help weaken the Russian war machine, the UK's foreign office says.","Anna Tsivileva is Russian President Vladimir Putin's first cousin once removed The UK has announced its newest wave of sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his cousin. The Foreign Office said Anna Tsivileva, Putin's cousin and president of a major mining firm, has been sanctioned. Vladimir Potanin, Russia's second richest man and key supporter of Putin's regime, was also sanctioned on Wednesday due to the war in Ukraine. The UK government said the sanctions were intended to ""weaken the Russian war machine"". The pair will be subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Ms Tsivileva, who runs prominent Russian coal mining company JSC Kolmar Group, significantly benefitted from her relationship with the president, the Foreign Office said. The UK government describes Vladimir Potanin as a key supporter of Vladimir Putin Mr Potanin, said to be worth $37.1 bn (Â£30.5 bn) according to Bloomberg, continues to amass wealth supporting Putin's regime, the UK says. The oligarch, who heads the world's largest refined nickel and palladium producer Nornickel, has acquired Russian bank Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bank in the period since the invasion of Ukraine. According to the reports, he moved his $300m superyacht to thesafe haven of Dubaias a precaution. The oligarch spent$2bn building the Rosa Khutor ski resortthat hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi - a project that he said would be his legacy, but that he hoped to get some of the money back from the Russian government. A UK government spokesperson said: ""As long as Putin continues his abhorrent assault on Ukraine, we will use sanctions to weaken the Russian war machine. ""Today's sanctions show that nothing and no one is off the table, including Putin's inner circle."" Vladimir Potanin's yacht has docked in al-Rashid port in Dubai this week A group of Russian individuals and companies have also been sanctioned for their involvement in supportingPresident Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. Russia will also be barred from accessing UK trusts services, which allow a person or business to manage the assets of another. The sanctions are the latest as part of a series imposed by the UK which has seen more than 1,000 people and over 120 businesses targeted. Three-quarters of foreign companies have reduced operations in Russia and nearly a quarter have completely withdrawn, according to the UK. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russia's economy buckles up for a bumpy ride Russians flee to Dubai to avoid sanctions It comes as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, in Madrid for a Nato summit, told the BBC that the UK must not become ""tired or fatigued"" in its support for Ukraine. She said: ""It's only possible to achieve a lasting peace, first of all, when Russia are pushed out of Ukraine, secondly, when Russia are held to account for the appalling war crimes that have taken place, and thirdly, when we know that future Russian aggression can be prevented, we must never allow this to happen again. ""And we must protect the future security of Europe."" She added she was also keen to help Taiwan defend itself, as China builds up its armed forces.

Mum told to stop breastfeeding at Sainsbury'sBeth Coles says she burst into tears after being approached by staff while feeding in her car.Hereford & Worcester,"Beth Coles said she had taken her daughter out as she did not want her to cry in the store A mum was left in tears after supermarket staff told her to stop breastfeeding her daughter in her car. Beth Coles, 25, took her baby Rosie for a feed when she became agitated in Sainsbury's in Kidderminster. She said she ""just burst out crying"" when an employee knocked on her car window and told her she was being ""inappropriate"". Sainsbury's offered its apologies in a statement for Ms Coles' ""unacceptable experience"". Ms Coles said the family had visited the shop on Friday evening on their way home from a day with her in-laws. ""We walked in and started doing our shopping, then our four-week-old child started crying,"" she told BBC Hereford and Worcester. ""I didn't want her to kick off in the store and didn't want to use their changing rooms so decided to take her out."" Rosie is just four weeks old She said she was covered in a blanket when she saw a female employee ""making a bee line"" for the car before knocking on the window. ""I opened it, thinking maybe I've dropped something, and she says 'can you not do that please, I think it's inappropriate'. ""I had no response, I just burst out crying."" Listen: Mum told to stop breastfeeding Ms Coles said the experience had left her not wanting to leave the house and made her conscious about breastfeeding. ""I just want to give it up,"" she said.  ""If that's the reaction from people that are supposed to be encouraging young mums, why bother?"" Women are encouraged to breastfeed and asking someone to leave a public place for breastfeeding is illegal. Julia Cooper,who successfully campaigned for it to be an offence to photograph a person breastfeedingwithout their consent, said she was appalled by what happened to Ms Coles. ""What people need to understand is the emotional impact of strangers observing and shaming you for breastfeeding - it's massive,"" she said. ""[Ms Coles] did everything she could to make other people feel comfortable, which isn't your job as a mother, but she did that and yet this person felt it was OK to police her body when she's doing the most natural thing and feeding her baby. ""It's appalling."" Sainsbury's insisted breastfeeding was welcome in its stores. A spokesperson said it was investigating and would deliver further training.

"Steel import tariffs extended for two yearsControls have been extended because of ""global disruptions"" to energy markets, the government says.Business","Tariffs on steel imports that were due to expire will be retained for a further two years, the government said. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the plans departed from the UK's ""international legal obligations"" but was in the ""national interest"" to protect steel makers. She added the decision was made due to ""global disruptions"" to energy markets and supply chains. British steel producers are under pressure from soaring energy prices. Steelmaking is a key industry for some parts of the UK, where it employs 34,000 people and turns over Â£2bn annually. Without controls the government has warned the supply of steel into the UK could rise substantially, harming local manufacturers. UK Steel previously said ending the import controls could cause as much as Â£150m a year in damage. Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany at the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect metal manufacturers. But there were concerns such a decision could breach international law as the question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. Ms Trevelyan said the decision ""departs from our international legal obligations"" of a WTO agreement. ""However, from time to time, issues may arise where the national interest requires action to be taken,"" she added. The limits on steel imports were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. The restrictions, which add a tax to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. Mr Johnson said: ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy."" The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories were set to expire on 30 June, before the government extended them for two years. Steelmaking accounts for just 0.1% of the UK economy - but the material being used in crucial sectors, from defence to transport, means that it's considered an important industry to shelter from cheaper imports. That's why the EU applied tariffs to some types of foreign steel, primarily on steel from China, in 2018, when the UK was a member. Now the UK has chosen to roll over many of those controls. The move, which has been expected for some months, was reported as one reason for the resignation of the Prime Minister's ethics adviser Lord Geidt - but he later dismissed the issue as a ""distraction"". The Trade Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan admits the extension of tariffs could be at odds with World Trade Organization rules - but claims it reflects exceptionally challenging times for the industry, especially in light of high energy costs. She has consulted other countries in the hope of avoiding a challenge, in the process attracting controversy for missing a parliamentary hearing on the Australian trade deal. With the EU and US also retaining similar tariffs, it underlines the tough choices between removing trade barriers, and protecting national businesses. Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director of the steelworkers' union Community, welcomed the extension saying it was ""extremely important"". ""Government made the right call because giving up our safeguards, when the EU and US are maintaining theirs, would leave us exposed to import surges threatening thousands of jobs,"" he said. Ms Trevelyan said maintaining tariffs would help defend a strategic industry and that British steel producers could face ""serious injury"" were the measures not maintained. ""The government is therefore actively engaged with interested parties, including those outside the UK on the future of the UK safeguards and has listened to the concerns raised,"" she added. The largest British trade body representing the industry, UK Steel, said the measures were ""absolutely vital to the long-term health of the steel industry in the UK"". ""Deficient or absent safeguards measures risk trade diversion away from shielded markets elsewhere, resulting in surges of imports into the UK,"" said Richard Warren, head of policy and external affairs at UK Steel. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: ""The extension of safeguards will come as a welcome relief to the steel sector. ""It is not anti-competitive to provide a level playing field for our steel industry,"" he said. ""I also support the decision to exclude Ukrainian steel."" But some criticised the move, saying it would stifle the supply of much-needed steel not produced in the UK. Despite being a ""step in the right direction,"" the Confederation of British Metalworkers boss Steve Morley said, the tariffs raise the ""very real prospect of lost orders and production being moved away from the UK."" ""British steel mills have not been able to supply the... materials our members need to support critical domestic and export supply chains, nor are they likely to be able to do so in the near future,"" he said.

US beach returned to black owners after 98 yearsA prime beachfront space in Manhattan Beach is given back to its black owners after its 1924 seizure.,"""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" said Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles Bruce A prime beachfront resort seized from its black owners nearly 100 years ago has been returned to their descendants by officials in Los Angeles. Bruce's Beach was purchased in 1912 to create a beach resort for black people at a time of racial segregation in southern California. Located in the desirable city of Manhattan Beach, it was forcibly taken by the local council in 1924. But on Tuesday, Los Angeles officials voted to return the land to the family. Willa and Charles Bruce bought the two lots of land for $1,225 in 1912. The beach is now worth an estimated $20m (Â£16.45m). Willatold a reporter at the time,external: ""Wherever we have tried to buy land for a beach resort, we have been refused, but I own this land and I am going to keep it."" Over the next decade, Bruce's Beach became a ""citadel for African Americans coming there for leisure from all over the rest of southern California,"" family spokesman Chief Duane ""Yellow Feather"" Shepardtold the BBC last year. But the local police department put up signs limiting parking to 10 minutes, and another local landowner put up no trespassing signs, forcing people to walk half a mile to reach the water, he said. When those measures failed to deter visitors, the local authorities seized the land under eminent domain laws - designed to let the government forcibly buy land needed for roads and other public buildings. Officials claimed they planned to build a park. That did not happen until many decades later, and the area remained vacant in the interim. On Tuesday, the motion to return the land acknowledged, ""it is well documented that this move was a racially motivated attempt to drive out the successful black business and its patrons"". A commemorative monument at the beach is often adorned with tributes - and a wedding photo of the pioneering Bruces The return is the result of a lengthy campaign and difficult process. The beach has for years featured a memorial plaque to Willa and Charles, and the state legislature had to pass a law to allow the return of the property. Now, the county will lease the land from the family for $413,000 a year - with a clause allowing the future purchase of the land for up to $20m plus costs,according to the lease agreement,external. ""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles said - calling it ""bittersweet"". ""It destroyed them financially. It destroyed their chance at the American Dream. I wish they could see what has happened today,"" he said. ""We hope this opens people's eyes to a part of American history that isn't talked about enough, and we think it's a step toward trying to right the wrongs of the past."" And the impact of the seizure is arguably still felt today, Mr Shepard has previously said. ""We were just ousted from that communityâ¦ there's only 1% representation of African Americans in Manhattan beach at this time,"" he said -a figure backed by the city's census data,external.

Fraudsters target under-35s on social media,"People under 35 are becoming the ""prime target"" for scammers tricking them into transferring money through social media platforms including WhatsApp. A banking industry body said intelligence suggested younger people were particularly hit by scams that played on their trust. UK Finance also warned that energy bill deal and tax scams were becoming more common as the cost of living rises. Criminals were ""building on people's fears"" of rising prices, it said. The banking industry body said that while people of all age groups are falling victim to scams, ""it is younger age groups that are often the prime target"". ""Our research found that people under 35 are more likely than older age groups to have been targeted in an impersonation scam and be swayed to provide personal or financial information,"" it said. Data from Barclays this month also showed people aged 21-30 were the most likely age group to fall victim to scams, due to the the majority taking place on social media, shopping sites and dating apps. UK Finance added that con artists were targeting all age groups by exploiting ""weaknesses outside of the banking system"", through online and social media platforms. If you've had money taken from your account, or your bank details stolen and payments made, then you're protected by law. Ultimately your bank should refund that money so they have a big incentive to crack down on that type of crime. It's working, with a fall in the number of unauthorised transactions, and record amounts of theft prevented. The bad news for customers is that the area that is most difficult to police and prevent is the area of fraud that's growing fastest. If you are conned into making a payment, an investment, or a transfer, then you've not got the same legal financial protections. You should still get in touch with your bank immediately, they may be able to chase the payment, possibly return it, and some will make good-will money back gestures, but they are not obliged to. With younger people being targeted more by these types of scams, and often more likely to fall for them, it's worth repeating the advice to just think for an extra second. Pause those speedy fingers, and don't give your details straight away. The type of scams criminals were using against people was evolving, the industry body said. Fake delivery texts asking for payment or NHS Covid-19 pass scams during the height of the pandemic were now being replaced by schemes focusing on cost-of-living challenges, it said. Criminals were now posing as different organisations ranging from the NHS, to banks and government departments via phone calls, text messages, emails, fake websites and social media posts. A type of fraud where people were duped into sending money and personal details surged 39% in 2021 compared with 2020 to Â£583m, UK finance said. This kind of fraud, known as Authorised Push Payment fraud (APP) - when victims think they are paying a genuine organisation - is on the rise, and outstripped fraud losses on bank and credit cards, which fell by 7% in 2021, for the first time. 'Fraudsters stole everything, even my house' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' However, less than half (47%) of the Â£246.8m worth of losses were returned to victims of APP fraud. The banking trade body said impersonation scams, along with investment and so-called ""romance"" scams were the ""most pernicious and prevalent"". Investment fraud cases surged by 57% and impersonation scams rose 36% on 2020. Investment scams, where a criminal convinces their victim to move their money to a fictitious fund or to pay for a fake investment, accounted for the largest proportion of losses APP crime in 2021, with losses increasing by 60% to Â£166.2m. Meanwhile, money lost through so-called romance scams, where the victim is persuaded to make a payment to a person they have met, often through social media or dating websites, and with whom they believe they are in a relationship, more than doubled in 2021 to Â£30.6m. Payment service providers were only able to return Â£12.6m - 41% - of the losses from romance scams, mainly because payments were made over an extended period of time and criminals had moved money by the time the crime was reported. Overall, Â£1.3bn, the most on record, was stolen through fraud in 2021, an 8% increase from the year before. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the scale at which people were experiencing authorised push payment scams was ""shocking"". ""Yet all too often victims face a reimbursement lottery depending on who they bank with,"" she said. ""The government has announced its intention to enable mandatory reimbursement for bank transfer victims who are not at fault and this needs to be brought in as soon as possible."" TSB told the BBC it refunded 98% of its fraud cases in 2021, compared to 47% across all banks. Paul Davis, director of fraud prevention at TSB, said it was ""disappointing that the industry's fraud refund rate has barely increased with over half the money stolen by fraudsters still not refunded to victims - at a time when people's finances are already squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis"". Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said there had also been a hike in investment scams where criminals set up fake cryptocurrency websites featuring celebrities supposedly endorsing them on social media. She said upcoming legislation - the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill - provided an opportunity for the government ""to give new powers on information sharing and tracking stolen money"". ""These are things we have long called for and will support efforts to work together and stop the fraud happening in the first place,"" she added. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, a specialist police unit that targets the organised criminal gangs behind fraud, prevented Â£101m of fraud in 2021 - the largest amount in the unit's 20-year history, UK Finance said. The industry body is urging customers to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, and remember that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police. People should contact their bank immediately if they think they have been conned and report it to Action Fraud. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Putin wouldn't have invaded if he were a woman - PM,"Boris Johnson has travelled to the Spanish capital Madrid for a Nato summit Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he were a woman, Boris Johnson has claimed. The UK prime minister said the ""crazy, macho"" invasion was a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"" and he called for ""more women in positions of power"". But Downing Street said there was ""not a deliberate policy"" to publicly belittle Mr Putin. Mr Johnson's comments come ahead of a Nato meeting where allies will discuss how to respond to future threats. At the summit in Madrid, he is set to call on fellow members of the defensive alliance to ramp up defence spending. The UK's defence spending is projected to reach 2.3% of GDP - a key measure of the annual income of a country - this year as a result of defence industry investment andÂ£1.3bn in military support for Ukraine, the government said. All Nato members have committed to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, but in 2021, the target had only been reached or exceeded by eight countries, including the US. Russia threat requires UK army cash boost - minister Turkey supports Finland and Sweden Nato bid New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry The spending target has been a source of tension within Nato in the past, with members pledging to work towards the 2% mark by 2024. At Wednesday's Nato summit, Mr Johnson will say that ""over the next 10 years the threats around us are only going to grow"". ""The 2% was always meant to be a floor, not a ceiling, and allies must continue to step up in this time of crisis,"" he will add. On Tuesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace urged Mr Johnson to increase spending on the UK's armed forces even further, in light of the threat posed by Russia. Mr Wallace told the BBC he was keen to have a ""grown-up discussion"" about how much the UK spends on defence and warned that the country could no longer bank on a ""peace dividend"". He said this level of spending was justified, given the threat posed by Russia, which has demonstrated it ""will take action against anyone or anybody"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been cutting defence for 10 years, and the armed forces needed a ""reboot in light of what's happened in Ukraine"". Speaking after the G7 summit of wealthy nations in Bavaria, Mr Johnsongave an interview to German broadcaster ZDF.,external On gender equality and the importance of education, he said: ""You need more women in positions of power."" ""If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn't, but if he were, I really don't think he would've embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has,"" Mr Johnson said. ""If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it's what he's doing in Ukraine."" Asked about the remarks, the prime minister's official spokesman said that ""there is not a deliberate policy"", adding: ""The British public would expect leaders to be robust with someone killing innocent civilians on a daily basis."" Mr Johnson's comments about Russia's president echo those he made during a discussion with G7 leaders at a meeting in Germany earlier this week. The leaders mocked the macho portrayal of Mr Putin, with Mr Johnson jokingly suggesting they ""show them our pecs"" to prove ""we're tougher than Putin"". In his interview with ZDF, Mr Johnson also said that while G7 leaders ""desperately"" wanted an end to the war in Ukraine, there was ""no deal available"" currently. But he also described the summit as ""incredible"" as leaders, ""got closer and closer"" to an agreement. Mr Johnson said the West must support Ukraine's military strategy, in order to get President Volodymr Zelensky ""in the best possible position"" in negotiations with Russia ""when talks eventually come"". The Nato meeting comes after news that Turkey has reached a deal withprospective members Finland and Sweden, removing a final barrier to their joining. This video can not be played Speaking in Germany, Boris Johnson compares standing up to Nazi Germany with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said Mr Putin had been ""proved completely wrong"" in his hopes to reduce Nato dominance as the two countries moved closer to joining the defence alliance. Arriving at the summit, the PM said: ""The first lesson is that if Vladimir Putin was hoping he would be getting less Nato on his western front as a result of his unprovoked, illegal invasion of Ukraine, he's been proved completely wrong - he's getting more Nato.""

"Legacy of campaigner Deborah James 'will live on'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge praise the ""inspirational and unfalteringly brave"" mother-of-two.","The cancer campaigner received a damehood for her fundraising work The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have paid tribute to cancer campaigner, broadcaster and former teacher, Dame Deborah James, who has died aged 40. They joined celebrities, politicians and people living with cancer in praising the ""inspirational and unfalteringly brave"" mother-of-two. She had been receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer at home, and had raised millions for cancer research. Dame Deborah's family said she was ""amazing"" and an ""inspiration"". They announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. ""We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,"" it said. She passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. Her family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to ""raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer"". ""Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring."" On Wednesday evening, Dame Deborah topped Â£7m of funds raised for research into specialised medicine for cancer patients. Deborah James 'taught us how to live and how to dieâ Tailored cancer care - Dame Deborah's fundraising legacy Dame Deborah James: The Last Dance An intimate tribute to Dame Deborah James. Following her death, we hear from friends, colleagues and fellow cancer patients as they celebrate her life and legacy. Watch on BBC iPlayer now. Writing on Twitter, Prince William and Catherine said: ""Deborah was an inspirational and unfalteringly brave woman whose legacy will live on."" Speaking from Madrid at a Nato summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Dame Deborah, describing her as ""an absolute inspiration"". ""I remember reading about her ages ago, just being incredibly moved by her account of her suffering but how it had actually driven her to do so much to raise awareness about bowel cancer,"" he said. The host of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast was first diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, and was given a damehood in May in recognition of her fundraising. Prince William visited her at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, to deliver it. He praised her tireless efforts and thanked her for giving hope to those living with the disease. For her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was surreal. ""You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,"" she said. A persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain Blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles Abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating Screening, run by the NHS,external, aims to detect bowel cancer at an early stage. It involves a home test kit, which looks for hidden blood in poo, being posted to you so you can complete it and send it back. But it's not available to everyone - only to those age groups most likely to benefit. Screening happens across the UK. In England, the age is being gradually lowered from over-60s to people aged 50 and over. In Scotland, screening starts from age 50. In Wales, it's for people aged 58-74. In Northern Ireland, it's for people over 60. If you are outside the screening age group where you live, you should still be aware of what bowel cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns.

Source:NHS UK,external Dame Deborah had a no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016. Signing off her finalpodcastin May, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. ""I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo."" Deborah James made a dame by William at her home Deborah James visits rose named for her at Chelsea A deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun newspaper and becoming a BBC broadcaster. But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left. ""My body just can't continue any more,"" she saidin a post on Instagram.,external Her podcast co-host, Lauren Mahon, said on Instagram ""there's only one Deborah James"" and asked to be given time beside a broken heart emoji. In a BBC documentary recorded before her friend's death, Ms Mahon said: ""Deb just has this ferocity in her to make a difference and to make sure that no one else suffers the same fate. ""Most people would have just run away from that, but Deb wanted to tell her story so that it wouldn't be anyone else's story,"" she said. Dame Deborah also launched a new fund - Bowelbabe - to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients. It surpassed Â£1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of Â£250,000 - and has now raised Â£7m. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher leaves a tremendous legacy behind her. BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital. He said the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness. He was struck by Dame Deborah's ""sheer generosity"", he said, and their chat was ""typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others"". Chef Ryan Riley became friends with Dame Deborah through his project Life Kitchen, which provides cookery lessons for people whose sense of taste has been affected by cancer treatment. Mr Riley said she offered people hope. ""She would be that voice online that wasn't as scared as they were and I think that really gave a lot of people a bit of comfort in a really difficult time."" he said. The chef said Dame Deborah's frankness forged a connection with people that was necessary to ""push the cancer community forward and bring awareness"".

TV presenter Lorraine Kelly became emotional as she paid tribute to her on her ITV morning show. She wore a pink jacket, the campaigner's favourite colour, and a T-shirt featuring the words ""Rebellious Hope"", which was her slogan. Fighting back tears, she said: ""We knew this was going to happen, but it still doesn't seem quite real."" She interviewed Steve Bland, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and was married to her former podcast co-host, BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in 2018. He told Lorraine that Tuesday night was ""very surreal"" and ""very numb"". Bland said the fact that Dame Deborah had known for five and a half years that her cancer was incurable made what she had achieved during that period ""even more remarkable"".

What's the truth behind shopping centre attack claims?,"The aftermath of a missile strike in Kremenchuk Within hours of the attack on a shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, false and unproven claims began circulating online. Stories were spread by Russian Telegram channels and by Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations. They included rumours that the attack was ""false"" or ""staged"" - and were repeated on Russian television. On Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry released a statement claiming the shopping centre was ""non-functioning"" and that the bombing of a nearby ammunitions dump sparked a secondary fire at the centre. Those claims were denied by Ukrainian officials. What's the truth? This claim is false. BBC reporters on the ground have spoken to shoppers and employees who were inside the building at the time of the attack. Multiple posts listing details of missing people who were either working at the shopping centre on the day or went shopping there, were published in alocal Telegram channel,externalin the hours after the attack. One pro-Kremlin ""fact-checking"" channel suggested that no photographs from inside the shopping centre had been posted on Instagram since March. However, a woman who lives in a nearby village and regularly goes shopping in Kremenchuk, told the BBC that the shopping centre had been ""constantly open"" and her family had visited it at least once a week. Inside the shopping centre things appeared to be relatively normal in a video filmed two days before the attack She also shared video she had taken at the shopping centre from 25 June, showing open shops and people walking inside the building. Other, similar footage posted online appears even more recent - includinga YouTube video apparently filmed just a day before the attack,external, also showing shoppers and businesses open as normal. A still from a video showing businesses open as usual two days before the attack Some Telegram channels claimed there were no women or children at the shopping centre -  implying that the building had been turned into a military facility. That claim is false, according to several eyewitness accounts and online videos. The Russian Defence Ministry claimed a strike on an arms storage facility detonated ammunition which set the shopping centre on fire. ""Western-manufactured weapons and ammunition stockpiled in the warehouse to be sent to a Ukrainian military grouping in Donbas were hit with a high-precision strike,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian officials have denied there was a weapons depot nearby. CCTV footage captured near a pond roughly 600 metres north of the shopping centre, on the other side of a factory building, shows two missile strikes in the area. Allow Twitter content?

Matching the exact spots where the two missiles land in the CCTV video with aerial images of the area, it appears one missile hit close to the eastern end of the shopping centre, while the other struck the northern end of the factory, near the southern edge of the pond. The factory mentioned by the Russian defence ministry is located roughly 300 metres north of the shopping centre. The buildings are separated by a wall, vegetation and rail tracks, making the claim that ""secondary explosions"" caused a large fire with multiple casualties in the shopping centre unlikely. This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage shows the extent of the destruction at the shopping centre According to the Ukrainian online publication Kyiv Independent,external, a press officer of the regional administration confirmed that the machinery plant had been hit, injuring two individuals. Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, denied there were weapons stored at the facility.""It's a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,"" she told the BBC. ""There's also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers."" This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows missile striking Ukrainian shopping mall Satellite images of the area, along with a video released by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky provide further evidence that these were the locations of the strikes. This video also supports an earlier Ukrainian assessment that the missile was an air-launched Kh-22 weapon. This is a medium-range cruise missile developed in the 1960s, originally to attack large warships. There is also a land-attack variant. The weapon is large, liquid-fuelled and supersonic - but inaccurate by today's standards. The relatively shallow angle of impact further points to its cruise nature. A ballistic missile follows a much more parabolic path. Ukraine says the missiles were launched from bombers in the Kursk region of Russia, some 300km (185 miles) away. Flames engulfing the mall in Kremenchuk This claim contradicts the official Russian defence ministry statement - even though top diplomats such as Mr Polyanskiy, the deputy UN ambassador, described the Kremenchuk attack as ""a new Bucha-style Ukrainian provocation"" on Twitter. There's simply no evidence - nor has any been offered - that Ukraine bombed the shopping centre, or that the attack was ""staged"". It's the latest example of a common tactic used by supporters of the Russian government - throwing multiple, conflicting, evidence-free narratives out in the immediate aftermath of an attack. The claim echoes other, debunked false assertions by Russia and its supporters, for instance that the attack on amaternity hospital in Mariupoland thekillings of civilians in Buchawere somehow faked or staged. In a Twitter message, Mr Polyanskiy said the attack ""will be used by Ukraine to attract as much attention as possible through promoting [a] false version of what happened"" and ""my tweet doesn't contradict the explanation provided by Russian [Ministry of Defence]"".

Number of holiday-let homes up 40% in three years,"Scarborough, famous for its beaches, saw a large increase in holiday-let properties The number of holiday lets in England has risen by 40% in three years, BBC analysis of council figures suggests. Tourist areas which already had large numbers of such properties - including Scarborough, the Isle of Wight, North Devon, the Cotswolds and Norfolk - have seen sharp increases. Ministers are looking at whether holiday lets should be registered. This comes amid concern that inflated property prices are pushing established residents out of many areas. Estate agents have reported a surge in second home ownership during the pandemic, with many buyers now offering these as holiday lets. Holiday let list examined over second home concern 'Boom' in second homes flipped to holiday lets The BBC has obtained data from 152 individual councils across England on short-term lets - available for at least 140 days of the year and registered for business rates rather than council tax. Among the councils who responded to the BBC, there was a 40% increase in such accommodation - from 19,543 in 2018 to 27,424 last year. This tallies with government figures for the same period - covering the whole country but not broken down to a council-by-council level - which also show a 40% rise. The Isle of Wight, whose attractions include the Needles, saw an upsurge in holiday lets Among the BBC's findings, the seaside resort ofScarborough,which includes Whitby, had the highest number of holiday lets, rising from 2,032 in 2018 to 2,913 in 2021. In second place wasNorth Devon,where the figure went from 1,319 in 2018 to 1,758 in 2021. East Suffolkwas third, going from 1,475 to 1,614 over the same period. Other areas where there was a sizeable number of holiday lets and a substantial increase between 2018 and 2021 included: TheIsle of Wight- up 39%, from 908 to 1,262 South Norfolk- up 97%, from 117 to 230. The Cotswolds- up 25%, from 802 to 1,002 York- up 49%, from 448 to 669 Great Yarmouth- up 44%, from 871 to 1,251 East Riding of Yorkshire- up 51%, from 549 to 831 This video can not be played 'There's a real fear if you're renting' Charlotte Bater grew up in the village of Georgeham in North Devon, close to the popular surfing beach at Croyde. She had to leave a rental property 10 months ago after being served with a no-fault eviction notice and she and her children moved back in with her parents. ""It does put a whole stop on your life. You can't plan anything. Everything comes back to: well, we don't know where we're going to be living. My children don't know where they're going to go to college. My youngest son, do you put him into nursery, do you not? I can't start back at work."" She says there are simply no properties available. ""If they do come up, they are extortionately expensive. There'll be two, three hundred going for the same properties - that's for private rentals."" In the village, banners outside the school show it has spaces - Charlotte says it used to be oversubscribed but now struggles with numbers ""which kind of gives you an indication as well into how the community's being affected, not just me"". Her friend Emma Hookway set up a campaign group for North Devon and neighbouring Torridge. ""There's a real fear in the area at the moment if you're renting. One of my friends the other day. she got a phone call from her estate agent and she felt like crying instantly. She thought, 'Oh, that's it, it's going to be sold. It's going to be converted into a second home or a holiday let.'"" Emma cleans holiday lets and says she understands the importance of the tourism industry to the area. ""We understand that people want to move to the area, that people are wanting to have holidays, especially being locked up after Covid. But there's got to be a balance and I think it's more important for people to be able to have their first home."" The government admits it only has a limited picture of how many properties across England are second homes and holiday-lets, particularly given the growth of online marketplaces such as Airbnb and Vrbo. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is looking at whether holiday lets should be registered, or even licensed. It has now launched a call for evidence, promised in its Tourism Recovery Strategy in June 2021, on the impact of short-term lets on England. Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston said the government was ""very aware"" of the issues. ""There are many benefits to having more accommodation provision in the UK. It's good for our tourism industry that there's a variety of accommodation offers, but it can come with a downside as well so we want to get the right balance,"" he said. ""One of the options is to license accommodation at one extreme, or we could end up doing nothing."" MPs from several different parties have been raising concerns. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron has previously called for more help for local people, and said the desire to buy second homes during the pandemic and the ease with which people can now advertise holiday lets online had pushed up prices. ""A bad situation has become entirely disastrous,"" he said in a debate earlier this year, adding that the cost of an average home in his constituency, which includes parts of the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, was now around 11 times the average wage. Some holiday-let owners say they switched to paying business rates during the pandemic to be able to access Covid grants, which may also have contributed to the increase in numbers. Simon Matthews, who runs a holiday let in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, said: ""These businesses were as badly impacted by Covid as any other hospitality business, the grants were a lifeline to keep them viable.""

Firms say government price cut plan 'slap in face',"A new government campaign asking businesses to cut prices to help with living costs has been branded a ""slap in the face"" for small firms. The Federation of Small Businesses said asking struggling companies to ""soak up additional costs just isn't realistic"". It's one of a number of groups who have criticised the plan for ataxpayer-funded ad campaign which involves firms slashing product prices from July. The government will be rolling out an official name with branding ""shortly"". David Buttress,the government's new cost of living tsar,,externalhas proposed the ad campaign, but a government source told the BBC that businesses will not be handed any subsidies or funding in order to cut prices. Martin McTague, national chair of the FSB, said most small firms were ""well beyond the point of being able to absorb extra costs without passing them on, which is often a last resort"". ""It's a slap in the face for government to spend the extra tax it is raising from businesses on state-run marketing campaigns - doubtless focused on big businesses with corporate offers that can now be rebranded as helping the cost of living crisis, and so boost their sales,"" he told the BBC. ""Asking this group to soak up additional costs just isn't realistic, especially when so many are worried about basic survival, and have already cut all expenses, even necessary ones, to the bone."" Cut prices, cost of living tsar urges businesses People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise Why are prices rising so quickly? Mr McTague argued there was ""much more the government could do to help"", such as reducing VAT rates to lift more small firms out of business rates, ""rather than just a marketing campaign using taxpayer resources to put government branding in shop windows"". In response, the government said bringing in Mr Buttress on an unpaid basis was ""the latest step taken by the government to ensure we're doing everything we can to help people in this country with the rising cost of living"". ""He will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people by encouraging businesses to do more to highlight discounted prices or product offers,"" a spokesperson said. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices increase - at 9.1%, the highest since March 1982. It is pushing people to cut back on food shopping and car journeys, due to record-high fuel prices, to save money. The boss of Wetherspoons, Tim Martin, said the campaign proposal was a ""classic example of tinkering, instigated by ministers who really don't understand money"". ""The main economic critique of this government is that it doesn't have an overarching plan, but just reacts to events, like a doctor who only treats symptoms, not the cause,"" he added. Mr Martin, a vocal supporter of Brexit, said eliminating tariffs on non-EU imports ""such as bananas, rice, coffee and children's clothes and shoes"" would ""immediately reduce shop prices and inflation"". The British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said asking small retailers to reduce prices was a ""flawed idea"". ""Supply chain inflation has been ahead of consumer inflation for some time, and as a result independent retailers have been operating on reduced margins by suppressing the retail prices,"" said Bira chief executive Andrew Goodacre. ""We believe that government intervention is needed to reduce prices and stimulate demand, and the best way is to reduce VAT,"" he added. Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, said bars, hotels and restaurants were ""already highly price competitive"" while it was also facing ""colossal input costs that make price reductions extremely difficult"". ""Energy costs are up 74%, goods 55% and labour up 54%, for example,"" she said. ""While government efforts to help consumers are always welcome, the reality is that just one in three hospitality businesses are now profitable."" In 2020, the government launched the ""Eat Out To Help Out"" scheme to support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period. The government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount. Duncan Brewer, a partner in EY-Parthenon's consumer products and retail team, said price was ""the single most important factor in how customers choose where they shop"", adding retailers were ""working exceptionally hard to give their customers the lowest prices possible"". ""They will be aware that raising prices by more than is absolutely necessary to keep their businesses afloat at this time is a real risk,"" he added. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added many retailers were expanding their value ranges to keep the price of ""essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups"". The CBI, which hosted Mr Buttress' speech, said it was ""vital the government continues to focus on building business confidence"" to help firms reduce the knock-on effects to consumers. ""Business will continue to work in partnership with the government to try and mitigate the impact of rising costs across the board,"" a spokesman added.

UK must insulate to reduce energy bills - report,"Changing energy and transport are key parts of curbing climate change The UK government must drive down energy bills and reduce climate-warming emissions by insulating more homes, a report says. Official advisors the Climate Change Committee says the government's current insulation programme is ""shocking"". It says consumers are paying Â£40 extra a year on bills because of previous cuts to the home renovation programme. The committee also says ministers must harness the Ukraine fuel crisis to push ahead with renewables. And it says to be fair to poorer families, the portion of electricity bills that pays back historic renewables should be taken off bills and absorbed by the Treasury. A really simple guide to climate change UK to miss tree planting target How we know humans are behind climate change The committee, also known as the CCC, is an independent body advising on climate policy. This report is an annual review of progress to MPs. It does praise ministers on two issues: it says the governmentâs renewable energy programme will save people Â£125 a year on bills by 2030. And it congratulates ministers on promoting electric cars â even though it says more charge points and more electric vans are needed. In response to the report, the government noted that over the past three decades the UK had driven down emissions faster than any other G7 country, and that it had clear plans to go further. ""The UK is forging ahead of most other countries with around 40% of our power now coming from cleaner and cheaper renewables,"" it said. ""This is backed up by Â£6bn of funding to make our homes and buildings more energy efficient, planting up to 30,000 hectares of new trees a year and more electric cars than ever before on our road - decarbonising our cars and vans faster than any other developed country."" But the CCC warned that unless housing and farming were tackled, the UK wonât achieve its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 'Scant evidence' The committee agrees that carbon-cutting policies are now in place for most sectors of the economy â but it says thereâs ""scant evidence"" that these goals will be delivered. And it warns that ministers need a back-up plan, including measures they may prefer to avoid such as asking the public to change behaviour by eating less meat and flying less. The chairman, Lord Deben, told BBC News that recent climate extremes were âvery, very worryingâ. He continued: âThe public should be proud of the UK setting best targets but Iâm very worried that thereâs no convincing programme for delivering policies. âIâm seriously worried that we are not moving fast enough to avert real catastrophe.â Lord Deben focused on what he called âa lack of sensible policyâ on home insulation. He said it was âscandalousâ that house-builders were still building new homes that will need retro-fitting. Overall the committee says credible plans exist for over a third of the emissions reductions needed by the mid-2030s. With luck the UK will manage another quarter; but thereâs a high risk that over a third of plans wonât deliver. It calls for a public engagement strategy on cutting emissions and wants analysis from the Treasury explaining how the costs and benefits of the low-carbon transition will be shared. It also urges changes in tax policy and planning legislation. This yearâs report runs to 600 pages â three times longer than usual. Thatâs because instead of relying just on reported data, this time the committee has sought evidence on the ground of the low-carbon transition in action. In a briefing, the committee again rejected proposals for a new coal mine in Cumbria, but said there would only be a tiny increase in emissions if old coal stations were used to keep the lights on in the winter. It said the governmentâs ambitions on nuclear power would be âvery toughâ to accomplish. Greenpeace spokesperson Ami McCarthy said: âItâs ironic that the CCC has named this a Progress Report when the governmentâs progress on climate policy is grinding to a standstill. âThe longer this government drags its feet on greening our homes, delivering renewables and moving our food production system away from meat, the sharper and more costly the shift will be. Time is running out.â Meanwhile, the engineering firm Atkins considers the CCC over-optimistic. Its separately-published analysis shows the UK needs to build 12-16GW of new generation capacity each year between now and 2035. It warns: âThe pace of new-build and complexity of the challenge means a dash to decarbonise power by 2035 may no longer be a credible ambition for the UK.â The CCC says that unless policies are radically improved, the government will need to try another tack by persuading people to fly less and eat less meat. The CCC also said the environment department Defra was guilty of âmagical thinkingâ over cutting planet-heating emissions from farms.

City returns beach to black owners after 98 years,"""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" said Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles Bruce A prime beachfront resort seized from its black owners nearly 100 years ago has been returned to their descendants by officials in Los Angeles. Bruce's Beach was purchased in 1912 to create a beach resort for black people at a time of racial segregation in southern California. Located in the desirable city of Manhattan Beach, it was forcibly taken by the local council in 1924. But on Tuesday, Los Angeles officials voted to return the land to the family. Willa and Charles Bruce bought the two lots of land for $1,225 in 1912. The beach is now worth an estimated $20m (Â£16.45m). Willatold a reporter at the time,external: ""Wherever we have tried to buy land for a beach resort, we have been refused, but I own this land and I am going to keep it."" Over the next decade, Bruce's Beach became a ""citadel for African Americans coming there for leisure from all over the rest of southern California,"" family spokesman Chief Duane ""Yellow Feather"" Shepardtold the BBC last year. But the local police department put up signs limiting parking to 10 minutes, and another local landowner put up no trespassing signs, forcing people to walk half a mile to reach the water, he said. When those measures failed to deter visitors, the local authorities seized the land under eminent domain laws - designed to let the government forcibly buy land needed for roads and other public buildings. Officials claimed they planned to build a park. That did not happen until many decades later, and the area remained vacant in the interim. On Tuesday, the motion to return the land acknowledged, ""it is well documented that this move was a racially motivated attempt to drive out the successful black business and its patrons"". A commemorative monument at the beach is often adorned with tributes - and a wedding photo of the pioneering Bruces The return is the result of a lengthy campaign and difficult process. The beach has for years featured a memorial plaque to Willa and Charles, and the state legislature had to pass a law to allow the return of the property. Now, the county will lease the land from the family for $413,000 a year - with a clause allowing the future purchase of the land for up to $20m plus costs,according to the lease agreement,external. ""This is a day we weren't sure would ever come,"" Anthony Bruce, a great-great grandson of Willa and Charles said - calling it ""bittersweet"". ""It destroyed them financially. It destroyed their chance at the American Dream. I wish they could see what has happened today,"" he said. ""We hope this opens people's eyes to a part of American history that isn't talked about enough, and we think it's a step toward trying to right the wrongs of the past."" And the impact of the seizure is arguably still felt today, Mr Shepard has previously said. ""We were just ousted from that communityâ¦ there's only 1% representation of African Americans in Manhattan beach at this time,"" he said -a figure backed by the city's census data,external. Should black Americans get slavery reparations? How do you prove your ancestors were enslaved?

MSPs back making Covid powers permanent,"Ministers say they want to be able to react quickly to any future public health emergencies MSPs have voted to make some emergency Covid-19 powers permanent, including the ability to impose lockdowns and close schools. Most pandemic powers were due to expire in March, two years after Scotland's first virus case was confirmed. As well as measures affecting the education and justice systems the new legislation also makes it harder for tenants to be evicted. But opposition politicians said the bill amounted to a ""power grab"". MSPs took five hours to debate more than 90 amendments to the Coronavirus (Recovery and Reform) Bill before passing it by 66 votes to 52. Scottish Covid powers to be extended by six months Some Scots Covid powers 'could be made permanent' MSPs agree to extend Covid-19 powers into 2022 The bill proposes changes in 35 specific legislative areas, many of which originated in temporary Scottish and UK Covid legislation. The reforms include permanent public health protection powers, similar to those which already exist in England and Wales. Ministers will also have powers in relation to educational establishments so they can take action to protect public health and ensure the continuity of educational provision There will also be increased protection for private rented tenants facing evictions, despite awarning from landlordsthat the new laws could cut the number of rental homes. And it will grant a temporary extension of some changes in the justice system to help manage the backlog of court cases arising from the pandemic. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said so-called ""Henry VIII"" powers in the legislation that allow ministers to make changes will be subject to parliamentary approval Other measures include giving licensing boards and licensing authorities the flexibility to hold hearings remotely and allowing local authorities to issue directions so that birth and death registrations can be done remotely. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ""While the vast majority of temporary pandemic measures have already been removed or will expire by the end of September, the passing of this bill maintains those that will ensure we are better prepared for future public health threats, pragmatic reforms that have enabled more efficient or convenient public services, and some temporary changes to mitigate the impact Covid has had on our justice system. ""I am grateful to members and everyone who has participated in the bill process for their feedback, which helped to shape significant amendments that strengthen parliamentary safeguards when it comes to the use of public health protection and educational continuity powers, and support for those experiencing financial difficulties."" Many of the proposals are aimed at future Covid-19 outbreaks - or the spread of any other infectious virus which poses a serious risk to public health. Mr Swinney, who is also the Covid Recovery Secretary, told the chamber that in response to concerns expressed over the move, an explanation will be required as to why regulations would need to be introduced urgently, and an expiry date set for instances where there is no time limit. So-called ""Henry VIII"" powers in the legislation that allow ministers to make changes will be subject to parliamentary approval, he added. He said: ""In all of these changes, the government has been listening to the concerns expressed by the external stakeholders and by members of parliament to ensure that we satisfy the objective of ensuring our statute book is updated to have the necessary powers to deal with the pandemic."" Use of such powers will be undertaken with an ""appropriate"" level of scrutiny from MSPs, Mr Swinney said. The Scottish Greens Greens claimed the bill would strengthen the rights of tenants and make it harder for landlords to evict tenants. The party's housing spokeswomen Ariane Burgess said: ""Access to good quality housing is a fundamental right and one that underpins the health, wellbeing, happiness and life-chances of people everywhere. This bill will be a big step forward for tenants, and will provide vital protections from eviction."" Murdo Fraser, of the Scottish Conservatives, said there were aspects of the Bill that his party would have been ""happy to support had they been brought forward in another form"". ""But too much in this bill to us was simply not necessary at this stage, and it does represent a power-grab on the part of Scottish ministers,"" he said. Mr Fraser added a survey for the Covid Recovery Committee had nearly 4,000 responses, with as many as 90% of people who responded expressing concern about the proposals Labour's Jackie Baillie complained that the legislation - which she branded a ""Frankenstein-like bill"" - will see powers ""handed over to government ministers"". The Scottish Labour deputy leader added that concessions by the government to address concerns ""simply don't go far enough"". Ms Baillie said: ""The executive will still have far-reaching powers which will potentially lead to ministers making rushed, ad hoc decisions, without the benefit of the appropriate level of scrutiny. ""This bill will not in and of itself lead to a better response to a future pandemic, and would diminish scrutiny and accountability. ""Let's be clear as to what ministers are attempting to do today, they are wrapping up a plethora of issues into one Frankenstein-like bill which is wholly unjustifiable."" The Liberal Democrats also criticised the government's approach, with Beatrice Wishart describing it as a ""unprecedented and unsavoury power-grab by the Scottish government"". She said: ""With this legislation the government is seeking to retain powers that they solemnly promised they would return as soon as possible.""

NHS staff having to say sorry for failing systemA leading doctor says staff are apologising for NHS failings which are letting patients down.Scotland,"NHS staff are increasingly having to apologise for ""system-wide failings"" which are letting patients down, a leading doctor claims. The outgoing chairman of BMA Scotland, Dr Lewis Morrison, will highlight the burden on health care staff during his farewell address later. He will urge ministers to ""stop asking doctors to say sorry and give them the tools to make things better"". The Scottish government said it was spending Â£1bn on its NHS Recovery Plan. Doctors are exhausted, says BMA chief Cancer waiting times performance at record low A&E waiting times match worst level on record Dr Morrison will tell the UK's BMA conference: ""Many of us have found ourselves saying sorry to patients and families a lot recently; most of the time we are being apologists for thing that are simply not our fault. ""That doesn't make it any less tough to be the messengers who bear the brunt for the myriad of things going wrong across the whole health system. ""And it's not just us - I know nurses, GP receptionists and all of us working in health care are in the firing line."" He will say that resources and staffing were stretched thin even before the pandemic and ""it is nothing short of a miracle we have somehow endured"". And he will warn that the effects of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of his colleagues has left many considering their future in the profession. ""The pain of working in, and apologising for, a system that is simply letting patients down at all stages is hard to over-estimate,"" he added. Dr Lewis Morrison will make his farewell speech to the BMA UK conference later Dr Morrison's comments come the day after the publication a series of statistical publications highlighting the challenges facing the NHS in Scotland post-pandemic. They revealed that almost 900 people waitedmore than 62 days for their first cancer treatmentin the first three months of 2022. In the week ending 19 June,2,262 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E,externalbefore being admitted, transferred or discharged. And there was a 51% year-on-year increase in the daily number ofbeds occupied by people medically ready to go home,external. Many cannot be discharged because there is nowhere suitable for them in the community. Care shortages could overwhelm NHS, doctors warn Dr Morrison will go on to suggest how Scottish ministers can tackle the issues in the health service. ""We need more honesty and frankly an explanation from Scottish government on how they allowed the NHS to come into a pandemic so grossly understaffed and under-resourced,"" he will say. ""Why is it doctors and NHS staff who are constantly having to explain and apologise to the thousands who will wait months or years for their tests or to be seen - while politicians continue to bang on about ridiculous targets and timescales for treatment, which we all know are unachievable? ""The pandemic did not cause these problems whatever they might say; it simply exposed the truth and the extent of them. Some honesty about that would go a long way. It would also help us really start to get to grips with solutions."" Health Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the efforts of NHS staff since the start of the pandemic and said the crisis had put the service under the most severe pressure in its 73-year history. He added Â£12m had been made available to support the mental health and wellbeing of the workforce in 2021/22. Mr Yousaf said: ""NHS Scotland staffing is at a record high level following 10 consecutive years of growth, with overall staffing up by over 23% since 2006. ""We're determined to go further and we are working with boards to enhance NHS workforce levels, fill posts and create new roles, backed by our Â£1bn NHS Recovery Plan which introduced a range of direct workforce investments and new measures to support health boards' capacity for both domestic and international recruitment.""

"Putin wouldn't have invaded if he were a woman - PMBoris Johnson says President Putin's war in Ukraine is a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"".UK Politics","Boris Johnson has travelled to the Spanish capital Madrid for a Nato summit Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he were a woman, Boris Johnson has claimed. The UK prime minister said the ""crazy, macho"" invasion was a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"" and he called for ""more women in positions of power"". But Downing Street said there was ""not a deliberate policy"" to publicly belittle Mr Putin. Mr Johnson's comments come ahead of a Nato meeting where allies will discuss how to respond to future threats. At the summit in Madrid, he is set to call on fellow members of the defensive alliance to ramp up defence spending. The UK's defence spending is projected to reach 2.3% of GDP - a key measure of the annual income of a country - this year as a result of defence industry investment andÂ£1.3bn in military support for Ukraine, the government said. All Nato members have committed to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, but in 2021, the target had only been reached or exceeded by eight countries, including the US. Russia threat requires UK army cash boost - minister Turkey supports Finland and Sweden Nato bid New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry The spending target has been a source of tension within Nato in the past, with members pledging to work towards the 2% mark by 2024. At Wednesday's Nato summit, Mr Johnson will say that ""over the next 10 years the threats around us are only going to grow"". ""The 2% was always meant to be a floor, not a ceiling, and allies must continue to step up in this time of crisis,"" he will add. On Tuesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace urged Mr Johnson to increase spending on the UK's armed forces even further, in light of the threat posed by Russia. Mr Wallace told the BBC he was keen to have a ""grown-up discussion"" about how much the UK spends on defence and warned that the country could no longer bank on a ""peace dividend"". He said this level of spending was justified, given the threat posed by Russia, which has demonstrated it ""will take action against anyone or anybody"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been cutting defence for 10 years, and the armed forces needed a ""reboot in light of what's happened in Ukraine"". Speaking after the G7 summit of wealthy nations in Bavaria, Mr Johnsongave an interview to German broadcaster ZDF.,external On gender equality and the importance of education, he said: ""You need more women in positions of power."" ""If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn't, but if he were, I really don't think he would've embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has,"" Mr Johnson said. ""If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it's what he's doing in Ukraine."" Asked about the remarks, the prime minister's official spokesman said that ""there is not a deliberate policy"", adding: ""The British public would expect leaders to be robust with someone killing innocent civilians on a daily basis."" Mr Johnson's comments about Russia's president echo those he made during a discussion with G7 leaders at a meeting in Germany earlier this week. The leaders mocked the macho portrayal of Mr Putin, with Mr Johnson jokingly suggesting they ""show them our pecs"" to prove ""we're tougher than Putin"". In his interview with ZDF, Mr Johnson also said that while G7 leaders ""desperately"" wanted an end to the war in Ukraine, there was ""no deal available"" currently. But he also described the summit as ""incredible"" as leaders, ""got closer and closer"" to an agreement. Mr Johnson said the West must support Ukraine's military strategy, in order to get President Volodymr Zelensky ""in the best possible position"" in negotiations with Russia ""when talks eventually come"". The Nato meeting comes after news that Turkey has reached a deal withprospective members Finland and Sweden, removing a final barrier to their joining. This video can not be played Speaking in Germany, Boris Johnson compares standing up to Nazi Germany with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson said Mr Putin had been ""proved completely wrong"" in his hopes to reduce Nato dominance as the two countries moved closer to joining the defence alliance. Arriving at the summit, the PM said: ""The first lesson is that if Vladimir Putin was hoping he would be getting less Nato on his western front as a result of his unprovoked, illegal invasion of Ukraine, he's been proved completely wrong - he's getting more Nato.""

Charles charity funded hard-up spies with Bond cashPrince Charles's charity appeared to be paying GCHQ - but it was funding for spies facing hardship.,"Prince Charles has faced questions about the operation of his charities Financial records from the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund appear at first glance to show a grant to an unexpected recipient - the GCHQ security agency. Alongside grants for causes such as the Red Squirrel Survival Trust and Exeter Cathedral is Â£100,000 for ""GCHQ"". But the 2014 payment is understood to be a donation from the makers of James Bond films, passed to a benevolent fund for former intelligence-service staff. Prince Charles's charity is under scrutiny over accepting cash donations. It follows a Sunday Times report that former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim gave the prince's charity about Â£2.5m, including cash in a suitcase and Fortnum and Mason carrier bags. Accounts from 2014 showing grants paid by the prince's charity The Qatari donations, between 2011 and 2015, were for the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, which provides individual grants to charities, good causes and local projects. The list of recipients of grants reflects many of Prince Charles's interests - the Prince's School of Traditional Arts, hospices, groups promoting religious tolerance, the Soil Association, Music in Country Churches, renovating Dumfries House and a range of social-inclusion and regeneration projects. But a grant of Â£100,000 for ""GCHQ"" also appears in the charity's financial accounts for 2014 and another Â£20,000 is recorded as being paid to the ""Special Air Service"" in 2013. Clarence House says the former relates to donations from the makers of James Bond films, given to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund to be forwarded to charities supporting former intelligence staff facing hardship. GCHQ, the Government Communications Headquarters, of which Prince Charles is patron, confirmed this was the case and the grants would provide help for former staff in need. Charles reported to have accepted a million euros in suitcase Charity watchdog checks Charles charity donation claims Police to investigate Prince Charles charity The funds listed as being paid to the SAS are understood to be for charities supporting former members of special forces. These were relatively small grants out of several millions paid to charities each year by the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund. Sir Ian Cheshire, who chairs the charity, said the next set of accounts would show another similar payment based on the most recent Bond film - and confirmed none of it would be paid in cash. It had been agreed between the prince, the charity and the Bond team, with the charity acting as the ""clearing house"" for the funds, he said. On the Qatari payments, Sir Ian said current regulations against money laundering would make such sums of cash unlikely to be accepted - but at the time, it was not uncommon for wealthy people from the Middle East to use large amounts of cash. The ""optics"" were not good, he said, but it had meant receiving a big donation from a prominent figure and giving it to good causes. The charity, one of several set up by Prince Charles, is no longer based at Clarence House, having changed address to other commercial premises in central London earlier this year. Charities are allowed to accept donations in cash - but former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker called the payments ""grubby and scuzzy"". He has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included in continuing investigations intoclaims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities. The Charity Commission, which regulates charities, is considering whether to launch a review of donations to Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund.

Firms say government price cut plan 'slap in face'A group says a government campaign asking businesses to cut prices is unrealistic for small firms.,"A new government campaign asking businesses to cut prices to help with living costs has been branded a ""slap in the face"" for small firms. The Federation of Small Businesses said asking struggling companies to ""soak up additional costs just isn't realistic"". It's one of a number of groups who have criticised the plan for ataxpayer-funded ad campaign which involves firms slashing product prices from July. The government will be rolling out an official name with branding ""shortly"". David Buttress,the government's new cost of living tsar,,externalhas proposed the ad campaign, but a government source told the BBC that businesses will not be handed any subsidies or funding in order to cut prices. Martin McTague, national chair of the FSB, said most small firms were ""well beyond the point of being able to absorb extra costs without passing them on, which is often a last resort"". ""It's a slap in the face for government to spend the extra tax it is raising from businesses on state-run marketing campaigns - doubtless focused on big businesses with corporate offers that can now be rebranded as helping the cost of living crisis, and so boost their sales,"" he told the BBC. ""Asking this group to soak up additional costs just isn't realistic, especially when so many are worried about basic survival, and have already cut all expenses, even necessary ones, to the bone."" Cut prices, cost of living tsar urges businesses People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise Why are prices rising so quickly? Mr McTague argued there was ""much more the government could do to help"", such as reducing VAT rates to lift more small firms out of business rates, ""rather than just a marketing campaign using taxpayer resources to put government branding in shop windows"". In response, the government said bringing in Mr Buttress on an unpaid basis was ""the latest step taken by the government to ensure we're doing everything we can to help people in this country with the rising cost of living"". ""He will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people by encouraging businesses to do more to highlight discounted prices or product offers,"" a spokesperson said. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices increase - at 9.1%, the highest since March 1982. It is pushing people to cut back on food shopping and car journeys, due to record-high fuel prices, to save money. The boss of Wetherspoons, Tim Martin, said the campaign proposal was a ""classic example of tinkering, instigated by ministers who really don't understand money"". ""The main economic critique of this government is that it doesn't have an overarching plan, but just reacts to events, like a doctor who only treats symptoms, not the cause,"" he added. Mr Martin, a vocal supporter of Brexit, said eliminating tariffs on non-EU imports ""such as bananas, rice, coffee and children's clothes and shoes"" would ""immediately reduce shop prices and inflation"". The British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said asking small retailers to reduce prices was a ""flawed idea"". ""Supply chain inflation has been ahead of consumer inflation for some time, and as a result independent retailers have been operating on reduced margins by suppressing the retail prices,"" said Bira chief executive Andrew Goodacre. ""We believe that government intervention is needed to reduce prices and stimulate demand, and the best way is to reduce VAT,"" he added. Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, said bars, hotels and restaurants were ""already highly price competitive"" while it was also facing ""colossal input costs that make price reductions extremely difficult"". ""Energy costs are up 74%, goods 55% and labour up 54%, for example,"" she said. ""While government efforts to help consumers are always welcome, the reality is that just one in three hospitality businesses are now profitable."" In 2020, the government launched the ""Eat Out To Help Out"" scheme to support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period. The government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount. Duncan Brewer, a partner in EY-Parthenon's consumer products and retail team, said price was ""the single most important factor in how customers choose where they shop"", adding retailers were ""working exceptionally hard to give their customers the lowest prices possible"". ""They will be aware that raising prices by more than is absolutely necessary to keep their businesses afloat at this time is a real risk,"" he added. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added many retailers were expanding their value ranges to keep the price of ""essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups"". The CBI, which hosted Mr Buttress' speech, said it was ""vital the government continues to focus on building business confidence"" to help firms reduce the knock-on effects to consumers. ""Business will continue to work in partnership with the government to try and mitigate the impact of rising costs across the board,"" a spokesman added.

NHS staff having to say sorry for failing system,"NHS staff are increasingly having to apologise for ""system-wide failings"" which are letting patients down, a leading doctor claims. The outgoing chairman of BMA Scotland, Dr Lewis Morrison, will highlight the burden on health care staff during his farewell address later. He will urge ministers to ""stop asking doctors to say sorry and give them the tools to make things better"". The Scottish government said it was spending Â£1bn on its NHS Recovery Plan. Doctors are exhausted, says BMA chief Cancer waiting times performance at record low A&E waiting times match worst level on record Dr Morrison will tell the UK's BMA conference: ""Many of us have found ourselves saying sorry to patients and families a lot recently; most of the time we are being apologists for thing that are simply not our fault. ""That doesn't make it any less tough to be the messengers who bear the brunt for the myriad of things going wrong across the whole health system. ""And it's not just us - I know nurses, GP receptionists and all of us working in health care are in the firing line."" He will say that resources and staffing were stretched thin even before the pandemic and ""it is nothing short of a miracle we have somehow endured"". And he will warn that the effects of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of his colleagues has left many considering their future in the profession. ""The pain of working in, and apologising for, a system that is simply letting patients down at all stages is hard to over-estimate,"" he added. Dr Lewis Morrison will make his farewell speech to the BMA UK conference later Dr Morrison's comments come the day after the publication a series of statistical publications highlighting the challenges facing the NHS in Scotland post-pandemic. They revealed that almost 900 people waitedmore than 62 days for their first cancer treatmentin the first three months of 2022. In the week ending 19 June,2,262 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E,externalbefore being admitted, transferred or discharged. And there was a 51% year-on-year increase in the daily number ofbeds occupied by people medically ready to go home,external. Many cannot be discharged because there is nowhere suitable for them in the community. Care shortages could overwhelm NHS, doctors warn Dr Morrison will go on to suggest how Scottish ministers can tackle the issues in the health service. ""We need more honesty and frankly an explanation from Scottish government on how they allowed the NHS to come into a pandemic so grossly understaffed and under-resourced,"" he will say. ""Why is it doctors and NHS staff who are constantly having to explain and apologise to the thousands who will wait months or years for their tests or to be seen - while politicians continue to bang on about ridiculous targets and timescales for treatment, which we all know are unachievable? ""The pandemic did not cause these problems whatever they might say; it simply exposed the truth and the extent of them. Some honesty about that would go a long way. It would also help us really start to get to grips with solutions."" Health Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the efforts of NHS staff since the start of the pandemic and said the crisis had put the service under the most severe pressure in its 73-year history. He added Â£12m had been made available to support the mental health and wellbeing of the workforce in 2021/22. Mr Yousaf said: ""NHS Scotland staffing is at a record high level following 10 consecutive years of growth, with overall staffing up by over 23% since 2006. ""We're determined to go further and we are working with boards to enhance NHS workforce levels, fill posts and create new roles, backed by our Â£1bn NHS Recovery Plan which introduced a range of direct workforce investments and new measures to support health boards' capacity for both domestic and international recruitment.""

But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left. ""My body just can't continue any more,"" she saidin a post on Instagram.,external Her podcast co-host, Lauren Mahon, said on Instagram ""there's only one Deborah James"" and asked to be given time beside a broken heart emoji. In a BBC documentary recorded before her friend's death, Ms Mahon said: ""Deb just has this ferocity in her to make a difference and to make sure that no one else suffers the same fate. ""Most people would have just run away from that, but Deb wanted to tell her story so that it wouldn't be anyone else's story,"" she said. Dame Deborah also launched a new fund - Bowelbabe - to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients. It surpassed Â£1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of Â£250,000 - and has now raised Â£7m. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher leaves a tremendous legacy behind her. BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital. He said the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness. He was struck by Dame Deborah's ""sheer generosity"", he said, and their chat was ""typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others"". Chef Ryan Riley became friends with Dame Deborah through his project Life Kitchen, which provides cookery lessons for people whose sense of taste has been affected by cancer treatment. Mr Riley said she offered people hope. ""She would be that voice online that wasn't as scared as they were and I think that really gave a lot of people a bit of comfort in a really difficult time."" he said. The chef said Dame Deborah's frankness forged a connection with people that was necessary to ""push the cancer community forward and bring awareness"". This video can not be played Remembering Dame Deborah James: 'One of those special people' Lizzie Parry, who edited Dame Deborah's column in the Sun newspaper, said: ""Even in her final days, as she faced her death, my bonkers, beautiful and bloody-minded friend refused to stop."" TV presenter Lorraine Kelly became emotional as she paid tribute to her on her ITV morning show. She wore a pink jacket, the campaigner's favourite colour, and a T-shirt featuring the words ""Rebellious Hope"", which was her slogan. Fighting back tears, she said: ""We knew this was going to happen, but it still doesn't seem quite real."" She interviewed Steve Bland, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and was married to her former podcast co-host, BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in 2018. He told Lorraine that Tuesday night was ""very surreal"" and ""very numb"". Bland said the fact that Dame Deborah had known for five and a half years that her cancer was incurable made what she had achieved during that period ""even more remarkable"".

UK heading for failure on climate goals - report,"Changing energy and transport are key parts of curbing climate change The UK government must drive down energy bills and reduce climate-warming emissions by insulating more homes, a report says. Official advisors the Climate Change Committee says the government's current insulation programme is ""shocking"". It says consumers are paying Â£40 extra a year on bills because of previous cuts to the home renovation programme. The committee also says ministers must harness the Ukraine fuel crisis to push ahead with renewables. And it says to be fair to poorer families, the portion of electricity bills that pays back historic renewables should be taken off bills and absorbed by the Treasury. A really simple guide to climate change UK to miss tree planting target How we know humans are behind climate change The committee, also known as the CCC, is an independent body advising on climate policy. This report is an annual review of progress to MPs. It does praise ministers on two issues: it says the governmentâs renewable energy programme will save people Â£125 a year on bills by 2030. And it congratulates ministers on promoting electric cars â even though it says more charge points and more electric vans are needed. In response to the report, the government noted that over the past three decades the UK had driven down emissions faster than any other G7 country, and that it had clear plans to go further. ""The UK is forging ahead of most other countries with around 40% of our power now coming from cleaner and cheaper renewables,"" it said. ""This is backed up by Â£6bn of funding to make our homes and buildings more energy efficient, planting up to 30,000 hectares of new trees a year and more electric cars than ever before on our road - decarbonising our cars and vans faster than any other developed country."" But the CCC warned that unless housing and farming were tackled, the UK wonât achieve its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 'Scant evidence' The committee agrees that carbon-cutting policies are now in place for most sectors of the economy â but it says thereâs ""scant evidence"" that these goals will be delivered. And it warns that ministers need a back-up plan, including measures they may prefer to avoid such as asking the public to change behaviour by eating less meat and flying less. The chairman, Lord Deben, told BBC News that recent climate extremes were âvery, very worryingâ. He continued: âThe public should be proud of the UK setting best targets but Iâm very worried that thereâs no convincing programme for delivering policies. âIâm seriously worried that we are not moving fast enough to avert real catastrophe.â Lord Deben focused on what he called âa lack of sensible policyâ on home insulation. He said it was âscandalousâ that house-builders were still building new homes that will need retro-fitting. Overall the committee says credible plans exist for over a third of the emissions reductions needed by the mid-2030s. With luck the UK will manage another quarter; but thereâs a high risk that over a third of plans wonât deliver. It calls for a public engagement strategy on cutting emissions and wants analysis from the Treasury explaining how the costs and benefits of the low-carbon transition will be shared. It also urges changes in tax policy and planning legislation. This yearâs report runs to 600 pages â three times longer than usual. Thatâs because instead of relying just on reported data, this time the committee has sought evidence on the ground of the low-carbon transition in action. In a briefing, the committee again rejected proposals for a new coal mine in Cumbria, but said there would only be a tiny increase in emissions if old coal stations were used to keep the lights on in the winter. It said the governmentâs ambitions on nuclear power would be âvery toughâ to accomplish. Greenpeace spokesperson Ami McCarthy said: âItâs ironic that the CCC has named this a Progress Report when the governmentâs progress on climate policy is grinding to a standstill. âThe longer this government drags its feet on greening our homes, delivering renewables and moving our food production system away from meat, the sharper and more costly the shift will be. Time is running out.â Meanwhile, the engineering firm Atkins considers the CCC over-optimistic. Its separately-published analysis shows the UK needs to build 12-16GW of new generation capacity each year between now and 2035. It warns: âThe pace of new-build and complexity of the challenge means a dash to decarbonise power by 2035 may no longer be a credible ambition for the UK.â The CCC says that unless policies are radically improved, the government will need to try another tack by persuading people to fly less and eat less meat. The CCC also said the environment department Defra was guilty of âmagical thinkingâ over cutting planet-heating emissions from farms.

Complaints higher at for-profit childrenâs homes,"Private children's homes run to make a profit in England have more police callouts and whistleblowing complaints than homes run by charities and councils, the BBC has learned. Analysis of new data from Ofsted shows the for-profit sector accounted for disproportionately high numbers. It is not known how many complaints about homes were upheld. Private providers say Ofsted ratings indicate no significant difference in overall quality between types of homes. The for-profit sector provides 69% of children's home bed spaces across England. But analysis by the BBC's File on 4 found that it accounted for 78% of lodged complaints between 2018-21. It also recorded 76% of all serious incidents involving the police last year. A high number of incidents may reflect the complex needs of individual children, says Ofsted, the government's children's services inspector. But the Association of Directors of Children Services - which speaks for social services' leaders - claims private firms are increasingly selecting the least challenging children, leaving councils struggling to find homes for those with the greatest needs. Residential homes are the last resort for many young people - with the foster care system judged as inappropriate for those who have suffered the worst abuse and neglect. Most homes in England and Wales - more than 80% - are run to make a profit. The rest are owned by charities or councils. Successive governments have encouraged more private involvement, while abuse scandals and budget cuts have led to the closure of many council homes. Some firms enter the care market prioritising profits over the needs of children in care, says Anne Longfield, the former children's commissioner for England. ""This [Ofsted] data should sound alarm bells ringing,"" she told File on 4. The 10 providers recording the highest number of serious incidents in 2021, involving police call-outs, were all profit-making private groups - with more than half owned by private equity companies. They accounted for 25% of all incidents, but only provided 19% of places. These 10 major providers collect more than Â£1bn from local authority children's services each year. The Horizon Care and Education Group - one of the top 10 providers owned by a private equity firm - runs 47 homes. It logged 124 police call outs and 15 complaints in 2020-21, according to Ofsted. It received Â£55m from local councils in that time. When asked by File on 4 about the number of call outs and complaints, Horizon said it took all incidents very seriously - and that 86% of its homes were rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, much higher than the market average. The BBC investigation also found that hundreds of children are being sent to deprived areas, where it is cheaper for private firms to locate homes. In the past three years Blackpool, which has a large cluster of privately run homes, received 255 children from 85 local councils - some of them many miles away, including Oxfordshire, Dorset and 10 different London boroughs. Another hotspot for private homes, Staffordshire, received 256 children from 134 councils including Plymouth, Essex and Brighton. Both the Welsh and Scottish governments have pledged to stop companies profiting from vulnerable children. In England, a government-commissioned review of children's care last month called for a complete end to profit-making but ministers have so far failed to back the demand. Children's minister Will Quince told the Commons after the review was published, that he had ""no issue with profit"" in general, only profiteering. He proposed greater market oversight.

The moment a salmon had its chips,"Gulp! Joshua Pedley captured this image of a dolphin catching a salmon This was moment a salmon reached the end of the line to become a dolphin's dinner. The image was captured by wildlife guide Joshua Pedley while he was out near Llanina Point, on the far side of Cardigan Bay. When the 27-year-old saw some movement in the water he immediately grabbed his camera. Mr Pedley, who works for New Quay dolphin watching business SeaMor, admitted he had no idea what to expect. Wally the walrus: Lifeboat crew use horn to budge animal Two octopuses spotted walking on a beach Bangor's part in the quagga's missing leg He said: ""We were watching a mother and calf milling about when their behaviour changed and we saw some quick darting through the water, so I grabbed my camera. Joshua Pedley grabbed his camera when he saw movement beneath the waves ""It was safe to guess something was about to happen. ""I could see there was a fish but it happened so fast I could not be sure what. ""Looking back at the photos it was a salmon coming out of the water one way and the dolphin leaping out at the same time."" It was only when he looked back at the images he realised how good they were It's not clear whether the mammal was working alone when the images were taken last Friday morning. ""It is quite possible there were more dolphins than we could see,"" said Mr Pedley, who lives in New Quay, Ceredigion, but is originally from Windsor. As soon as he saw how good the pictures were he got on the catamaran's PA system and told the 10 passengers to come and see them. When he put the pictures online people were surprised to see a salmon It was the first time he had ever captured images quite like that. They attracted a number of comments when he posted them on Facebook and Twitter. ""A lot of people were surprised to see a salmon,"" Mr Pedley said.

Charles charity funded GCHQ charity with Bond cash,"Prince Charles has faced questions about the operation of his charities Financial records from the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund appear at first glance to show a grant to an unexpected recipient - the GCHQ security agency. Alongside grants for causes such as the Red Squirrel Survival Trust and Exeter Cathedral is Â£100,000 for ""GCHQ"". But the 2014 payment is understood to be a donation from the makers of James Bond films, passed to a benevolent fund for former intelligence-service staff. Prince Charles's charity is under scrutiny over accepting cash donations. It follows a Sunday Times report that former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim gave the prince's charity about Â£2.5m, including cash in a suitcase and Fortnum and Mason carrier bags. Accounts from 2014 showing grants paid by the prince's charity The Qatari donations, between 2011 and 2015, were for the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, which provides individual grants to charities, good causes and local projects. The list of recipients of grants reflects many of Prince Charles's interests - the Prince's School of Traditional Arts, hospices, groups promoting religious tolerance, the Soil Association, Music in Country Churches, renovating Dumfries House and a range of social-inclusion and regeneration projects. But a grant of Â£100,000 for ""GCHQ"" also appears in the charity's financial accounts for 2014 and another Â£20,000 is recorded as being paid to the ""Special Air Service"" in 2013. Clarence House says the former relates to donations from the makers of James Bond films, given to the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund to be forwarded to charities supporting former intelligence staff facing hardship. GCHQ, the Government Communications Headquarters, of which Prince Charles is patron, confirmed this was the case and the grants would provide help for former staff in need. Charles reported to have accepted a million euros in suitcase Charity watchdog checks Charles charity donation claims Police to investigate Prince Charles charity The funds listed as being paid to the SAS are understood to be for charities supporting former members of special forces. These were relatively small grants out of several millions paid to charities each year by the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund. Sir Ian Cheshire, who chairs the charity, said the next set of accounts would show another similar payment based on the most recent Bond film - and confirmed none of it would be paid in cash. It had been agreed between the prince, the charity and the Bond team, with the charity acting as the ""clearing house"" for the funds, he said. On the Qatari payments, Sir Ian said current regulations against money laundering would make such sums of cash unlikely to be accepted - but at the time, it was not uncommon for wealthy people from the Middle East to use large amounts of cash. The ""optics"" were not good, he said, but it had meant receiving a big donation from a prominent figure and giving it to good causes. The charity, one of several set up by Prince Charles, is no longer based at Clarence House, having changed address to other commercial premises in central London earlier this year. Charities are allowed to accept donations in cash - but former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker called the payments ""grubby and scuzzy"". He has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included in continuing investigations intoclaims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities. The Charity Commission, which regulates charities, is considering whether to launch a review of donations to Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund.

'We say sorry to patients but it's not our fault',"NHS staff are increasingly having to apologise for ""system-wide failings"" which are letting patients down, a leading doctor claims. The outgoing chairman of BMA Scotland, Dr Lewis Morrison, will highlight the burden on health care staff during his farewell address later. He will urge ministers to ""stop asking doctors to say sorry and give them the tools to make things better"". The Scottish government said it was spending Â£1bn on its NHS Recovery Plan. Doctors are exhausted, says BMA chief Cancer waiting times performance at record low A&E waiting times match worst level on record Dr Morrison will tell the UK's BMA conference: ""Many of us have found ourselves saying sorry to patients and families a lot recently; most of the time we are being apologists for thing that are simply not our fault. ""That doesn't make it any less tough to be the messengers who bear the brunt for the myriad of things going wrong across the whole health system. ""And it's not just us - I know nurses, GP receptionists and all of us working in health care are in the firing line."" He will say that resources and staffing were stretched thin even before the pandemic and ""it is nothing short of a miracle we have somehow endured"". And he will warn that the effects of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of his colleagues has left many considering their future in the profession. ""The pain of working in, and apologising for, a system that is simply letting patients down at all stages is hard to over-estimate,"" he added. Dr Lewis Morrison will make his farewell speech to the BMA UK conference later Dr Morrison's comments come the day after the publication a series of statistical publications highlighting the challenges facing the NHS in Scotland post-pandemic. They revealed that almost 900 people waitedmore than 62 days for their first cancer treatmentin the first three months of 2022. In the week ending 19 June,2,262 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E,externalbefore being admitted, transferred or discharged. And there was a 51% year-on-year increase in the daily number ofbeds occupied by people medically ready to go home,external. Many cannot be discharged because there is nowhere suitable for them in the community. Care shortages could overwhelm NHS, doctors warn Dr Morrison will go on to suggest how Scottish ministers can tackle the issues in the health service. ""We need more honesty and frankly an explanation from Scottish government on how they allowed the NHS to come into a pandemic so grossly understaffed and under-resourced,"" he will say. ""Why is it doctors and NHS staff who are constantly having to explain and apologise to the thousands who will wait months or years for their tests or to be seen - while politicians continue to bang on about ridiculous targets and timescales for treatment, which we all know are unachievable? ""The pandemic did not cause these problems whatever they might say; it simply exposed the truth and the extent of them. Some honesty about that would go a long way. It would also help us really start to get to grips with solutions."" Health Secretary Humza Yousaf praised the efforts of NHS staff since the start of the pandemic and said the crisis had put the service under the most severe pressure in its 73-year history. He added Â£12m had been made available to support the mental health and wellbeing of the workforce in 2021/22. Mr Yousaf said: ""NHS Scotland staffing is at a record high level following 10 consecutive years of growth, with overall staffing up by over 23% since 2006. ""We're determined to go further and we are working with boards to enhance NHS workforce levels, fill posts and create new roles, backed by our Â£1bn NHS Recovery Plan which introduced a range of direct workforce investments and new measures to support health boards' capacity for both domestic and international recruitment.""

Williams beaten by Tan in Wimbledon thriller,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Serena Williams loses to Harmony Tan on singles return Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Serena Williams' hopes of a victorious return to Wimbledon after a year out ended with a loss to Harmony Tan. The American great, 40, returned to the same Centre Court where she had limped out injured last year with a passionate display in a 7-5 1-6 7-6 (10-7) defeat. Willed on by a fervent crowd, Williams answered questions over her fitness with a dynamic display that put her two points from a win before Tan edged it. The burning question now is surely 'was this her last Wimbledon'? ""That's a question I can't answer,"" she told a news conference. ""I don't know. ""Who knows? Who knows where I'll pop up."" Raducanu and Murray lead the way on day three 'I love being called a trailblazer' - Ons Jabeur column Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone It is almost a year to the day since Williams limped tearfully off Centre Court after slipping and hurting her right ankle in her first-round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich. The crowd that day might have wondered if they would ever see the American great back at the grass-court Grand Slam, with age and injury against her. Even she herself admitted while at Eastbourne this month - where she made her comeback in the doubles alongside Ons Jabeur - that she had harboured her own doubts. But Williams walked on to the same court, where she has won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles, to a rousing reception. Now ranked 1,204th in the world, she had needed to request a wildcard to enter the draw. And she soon showed why she was never going to be turned down. Shaking off a slightly rusty start in which she was broken by the Wimbledon debutant in the first game, Williams found her feet - and her voice - as she roared when a smash sealed a break back. The pair traded further breaks, with Williams hitting balls on the run, moving much better than a year out of the sport might have suggested, and delivering some of the trademark powerful shots that have made her one of her sport's all-time greats. But a break for Tan in the 11th game left the Frenchwoman serving for the set, which she sealed with a forehand winner. Such was the excitement at times during some lengthy and high quality points that the umpire even had to remind the packed Centre Court: ""I know it's very exciting but as a courtesy to both players please be quiet during the rallies."" And that was before the roof went on before the start of the second set to raise the decibel level further. Williams held quickly to love and then broke in a near 20-minute second game, which featured 12 deuces, on her way to a 5-0 lead. Tan, 24, earned a morale-boosting hold before Williams served out to take it to a deciding set. The American, whose only matches in the past year were last week's two doubles, broke early in the third but tenacious Tan soon pegged her back. Williams had celebrated as if she had won the match when she broke for 5-4 in the decider but it proved premature when, having led 30-15 while serving for the match, she was broken again. Williams forged a 4-0 lead in the final-set tie-break but it slipped away as Tan delivered some stunning winners and the American netted a forehand on match point. ""For my first Wimbledon it's wow - just wow,"" said world number 115 Tan. ""It's a dream because, you know, I saw Serena on the TV when I was young. She's a legend. When you play her, I was scared. I mean, I was scared when I was on the court, but really happy to be there."" There had always been sense that Williams had unfinished business at Wimbledon after the way her tournament ended after six games last year and one of the big motivating factors behind her return was not wanting that to be her final SW19 memory. She has always remained motivated by the desire to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles, and her best chance of doing that is likely to be on a fast grass surface. She can take some encouragement from the fact she stayed at a high level during a draining encounter that finished after 22:30 BST and lasted three hours 11 minutes. But whether that is enough to keep her in the sport when she has huge business interests and family life to enjoy remains to be seen. Asked whether she would be OK with this match being her last Wimbledon memory, she was categorical: ""Obviously not. You know me. Definitely not. ""But today I gave all I could do, you know, today. Maybe tomorrow I could have given more. Maybe a week ago I could have given more. But today was what I could do. ""At some point you have to be able to be OK with that."" But she said coming so close to victory made her want to hit the practice courts and she did not rule out an appearance at the US Open in August-September. ""I mean, when you're at home, especially in New York, and the US Open, that being the first place I've won a Grand Slam [in 1999], is something that's always super special. ""There's definitely lots of motivation to get better and to play at home.""
