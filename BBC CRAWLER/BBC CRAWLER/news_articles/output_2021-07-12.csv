"PM must level up the North at pace, say Tory MPs","The prime minister must start delivering an ambitious levelling-up programme for the north of England ""at pace"", according to a group of 50 Conservative MPs. The Northern Research Group is calling for an economic strategy focused on helping communities in the North rebuild after the pandemic. It wants special grants for deprived areas outside London. Ministers say they are ""totally committed to levelling up"". What is levelling up and how is it going? Northern England 'worst hit' by Covid-19 pandemic 'Red Wall' Tories form group to campaign for north The NRG was founded by a number of Conservatives who won so-called red wall seats from Labour at the 2019 general election and want to push the government for greater investment for northern areas. The pandemic has renewed attention on regional disparities. Arecent studyby the Northern Health Science Alliance found the North has been hit harder than the rest of England during coronavirus, ""exacerbating"" regional inequalities. At theQueen's Speech,externalin May, ministers said they would ""level-up opportunities across all parts of the United Kingdom as Britain recovers from the pandemic"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also expected to deliver a speech shortly on the issue. NRG chairman Jake Berry told the BBC: ""We have been in lockdown longer than any other area of the country. ""It's time for the government to show the North some love with a summer of levelling up."" He said the prime minister relies for his majority in Parliament on votes in the North and there is now an opportunity to encourage investment, jobs and industry there. He added: ""Since December 2019, we have heard a lot about plans to level up the North, now is the time to show how we can deliver. ""No one in the North cares about internal governmental turf wars. ""They want real jobs, real change, and real opportunities. ""It's time to start delivering an ambitious programme at pace if we are going to see real progress this summer."" The group wants a recovery plan focused on infrastructure. It is calling for automatic grants to help deprived areas outside London, the formation of a northern growth board and - as part of a plan for better transport - the abolition of road tax and fuel duty, to be replaced with a system under which revenue raised would be kept in the North. A government spokesperson said: ""We're investing Â£100bn in infrastructure this year, as well as creating a new Â£4.8bn Levelling Up Fund, establishing free ports across the UK and a new UK infrastructure bank in Leeds to harness private investment and fund new projects."" The spokesman said ministers will publish a Levelling Up White Paper later this year, which will set out plans to ""improve livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic"".

Train firms must decide whether to mandate masks,"The government has said bus and train companies must decide whether passengers have to wear face coverings on their services from Monday, when Covid rules are relaxed in England. Face masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus. But those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services. Transport firms will be left to decide whether to enforce that advice and how. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transport, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. Nevertheless, bus and train companies will still be able to turn away passengers who refuse to wear one - unless they are exempt. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said some of the 3.8m people classed as clinically vulnerable would be ""fearful"" to go on public transport if masks were not compulsory. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet taken the decision whether to require masks on trams in Manchester as he wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion. Treasury Minister Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the emphasis was now on ""trusting the British public"" to take a cautious approach and there would be specific guidance for vulnerable people. What changes will I see when restrictions end on 19 July? How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? Why is social distancing coming to an end? London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the safest option would be to continue to legally require people to wear masks on public transport. His comments came asLabour criticised the government's approach to unlockingin England as ""high risk"" and ""fatalistic"". While virtually all legal restrictions in England will be lifted on Monday, some guidance will remain. There will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will be removed. Nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen for the first time since March 2020 and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events. But nightclubs and other venues with large crowds will be encouraged to use Covid status certification - so-called domestic vaccine passports - ""as a matter of social responsibility"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. Government guidance to work from home where possible will be lifted, but ministers are encouraging a gradual return to the workplace. On face coverings, Mr Johnson said: ""We expect and recommend that people wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with those you don't normally meet, such as on public transport."" Asked if Monday's rule changes were irreversible, as has been repeatedly stated, Mr Johnson said he hoped they were but ""we must rule nothing out"". And in the Commons, Mr Javid said the government will ""have a review"" in September ""to make sure that we're properly set up for autumn and for winter"". Transport companies have been weighing up whether to mandate masks or not. If you're flying, chances are you will still need to wear one; many airlines have decided to keep masks as a requirement for travel. But most train, bus and coach operators in England will now decide they won't be mandatory, following the lead set by rail and passenger groups. Companies will still ask passengers to wear masks when services are busy. But there's concern among many transport operators that a blanket requirement could make people think that public transport is more dangerous than other indoor settings, like restaurants and pubs. We haven't yet heard from the London Mayor about whether masks will be required on Transport for London-run services. Wales and Scotland both still require anyone travelling on public transport to wear a mask by law, meaning that those taking services that cross the border from England will have notices reminding them to wear a face covering unless exempt. It is the second time this has happened during the course of the pandemic. The Confederation of Passenger Transport - a trade group representing bus and coach companies - said passengers will find it ""difficult to understand"" why the prime minister has ""singled out public transport as somewhere to wear a face covering when a range of other activities share its characteristics."" The group said it wanted clear guidance for operators and customers, adding that it was important to respect everyone's right to choose whether to wear a face covering once restrictions had eased. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said its members would ask passengers to wear face coverings in busy indoor settings ""out of respect for others"". It said enhanced cleaning would continue after 19 July and train companies would provide better information about how busy services are. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed masks would continue to be required on public transport and in healthcare settings ""even if"" the nation relaxes restrictions, which aredue to be reviewed,externalon 15 July. Rules regarding face coverings are due to be considered next month inNorthern Ireland, which is due to ease some Covid measures on 26 July. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to make an announcement about restrictions on Tuesday.Scotland is expected,externalto move to level 0 - the lowest level of restrictions in its roadmap - on 19 July and lift most legal restrictions on 9 August. The prime minister said it was vital to proceed with ""caution"" in England after 19 July, warning ""this pandemic is not over"" . Covid: 'For us it's not freedom day' Some firms to insist people still wear face masks Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcare 'Personal responsibility needed to live with Covid' The peak of the current wave is not expected before mid-August and could lead to between 1,000 and 2,000 hospital admissions per day, according to government scientists. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty. On Monday, the UK recorded 34,471 new cases, as well as six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It was the sixth consecutive day that cases were above 30,000. The number of deaths recorded on Mondays are often lower due to reporting lags over the weekend. More than 45.9 million people - or 87% of adults in the UK - have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. And more than 34.8 million - around two-thirds of adults - have had both doses.

Springtime bounceback lifts UK High Streets,"Retail sales enjoyed a springtime bounceback, with growth in High Street sales from April to June making it the best three months on record, industry body figures indicate. Sales in the period rose 28.4% from a year ago, and were up 10.4% from 2019. June's sunny weather and the Euro 2020 tournament helped to boost trade, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. But the BRC warned that many retailers still faced ""strong headwinds"" as the UK economy recovers from the pandemic. In June, fashion and footwear did well during the brief burst of sunshine, while the start of the Euro 2020 football championship provided a boost for TVs, snack food and beer. However, online sales remained much higher than their pre-pandemic levels, suggesting the shift to online was ""here to stay"", the BRC-KPMG retail sales report found. There were also signs of a dilution in retail consumer spending as the hospitality and leisure sectors reopened, leading to a ""fight for share of wallet"", it said. UK economic growth slows in May Retail sales fall in May as shoppers dine out ""Retailers are facing challenges on a number of fronts, particularly convincing consumers that it's safe to shop in store as restrictions around mask wearing and social distancing come to an end,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. But he added that High Street retailers were hoping for a ""summer boost"" with the lifting of Covid restrictions. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The second quarter of 2021 saw exceptional growth as the gradual unlocking of the UK economy encouraged a release of pent-up demand built up over previous lockdowns. ""In June, while growth in food sales began to slow, non-food sales were bolstered by growing consumer confidence and the continued unleashing of consumer demand. ""With many people taking staycations, or cheaper UK-based holidays, many have found they have a little extra to spend at the shops, with strong growth in-store in June."" Fashion and footwear enjoyed a sales surge, said the BRC Ms Dickinson said ""consumer comfort with the next stage of the roadmap"" would be key. Many customers were looking forward to a return to a more normal shopping experience, while others might be discouraged by changes in face-covering rules, she added. She said the government would need to reassure the public on safety, while pushing forward with its ""hugely successful"" vaccination programme. ""The public will also need to be understanding of one another during the easing of restrictions,"" she warned. ""There has been a big rise in violence and abuse against retail workers during the pandemic and colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy."" New data from Barclaycard indicates that consumer spending rose 11.1% in June compared with the same period in 2019, as warmer weather and the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an economic uplift. Barclaycard said spending on fuel, hotels, resorts and accommodation all grew for the first time since the pandemic began, as holidaymakers booked and embarked on UK breaks. Face-to-face retail grew 9.7%, the credit card firm said. However, there were signs that pent-up demand was easing off, as clothing and furniture stores recorded smaller increases than in May.

Virgin Galactic may sell up to $500m of sharesThe company filed to sell up to $500m (Â£360m) in stock the day after its founder reached the edge of space.Business,"Virgin Galactic has said it may sell up to $500m of shares after completing a successful space trip on Sunday. In a filing,external, the company says it plans to use cash raised to develop its spaceship fleet and infrastructure. On Sunday, Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic's billionaire founder, reached the edge of space on one of the planes it has been developing for 17 years. He called the trip the ""experience of a lifetime"" after returning to Earth just over an hour after leaving the ground. The trip also made the entrepreneur the first of the new space tourism pioneers to try out their own shuttles, beating Amazon's Jeff Bezos and SpaceX's Elon Musk. Shares in Virgin Galactic rose about 8% before markets opened in the US on Monday. But they had tumbled 17% by the end of the day, after its share sale was announced. Sir Richard and his Virgin Group currently hold a 24% stake in the company. He billed the flight - on which he was accompanied by two pilots and three company employees - as a crucial test of the space tourism experience he expects to begin selling to customers from next year. ""I've had my notebook with me and I've written down 30 or 40 little things that will make the experience for the next person who goes to space with us that much better,"" he said. ""The only way sometimes you can find these little things is to get in a spaceship and go to space and experience it for yourself."" Some 600 individuals have already paid deposits for tickets that will cost them up to $250,000 - including Space X and Tesla's Elon Musk, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal. Sir Richard first announced his intention to make a space plane in 2004, with the belief he could start a commercial service by 2007. Despite technical difficulties and a fatal crash in 2014, the firm's stock has nearly doubled this year as its commercial launch gets closer. Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said that the company could start taking more flight bookings for wealthy customers soon. ""We view Branson's achievement as a massive marketing coup for Virgin Galactic that will be impossible for the public to ignore,"" he said in a note.

Elon Musk ârather hatesâ being Tesla boss,"Elon Musk has revealed that he does not enjoy being the boss of Tesla. ""I rather hate it and I would much prefer to spend my time on design and engineering,"" he told a US court. Tesla's billionaire CEO was speaking at the start of a trial where he is accused of pressuring the firm's board members into a $2.6bn (Â£1.9bn) deal to buy a solar panel firm. Shareholders claim the carmaker's money was wasted on buying SolarCity, which - they say - was running out of money. At the time of the deal, Mr Musk owned a 22% stake in both Tesla and the solar panel company, which was founded by his cousins. ""Since it was a stock-for-stock transaction and I owned almost exactly the same percentage of both there was no financial gain,"" he said. He also denied exerting pressure on board members, saying that the deal was part of a ""master plan"" to create affordable vehicles with green power supplies. Shareholders bringing the case against Mr Musk, who is worth $168bn according to Forbes, have asked the court that he repay Tesla the $2.6bn in full. That would be one of the largest ever judgements against an individual. Last year, other board members at Tesla settled a lawsuit over the deal for $60m. Those board members, who excluded Mr Musk, did not admit any wrongdoing. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that investors would be watching the case very closely. The SolarCity deal has been a ""black eye"" for both Mr Musk and Tesla and a ""clear low light"" in the company's rise, he wrote in a note. Despite that, Tesla shares rose on Monday, closing more than 4% higher. The trial is expected to last about two weeks. Randall Baron, the attorney for the shareholders, warned the entrepreneur that the case being heard in Delaware Chancery Court was ""going to be a grind"". Gesturing to a thick folder of documents prepared by Mr Baron, Mr Musk replied: ""I can tell by the binder.""

England's Mings attacks Patel over racism response,"England's Tyrone Mings at a training session England footballer Tyrone Mings has accused the home secretary of pretending to be disgusted by racist abuse, after she previously described taking the knee as ""gesture politics"". Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they missed penalties in the Euro 2020 final. Priti Patel said she was ""disgusted"" by the online abuse directed at the trio. Mings said she had ""stoked the fire"" by refusing to criticise fans who booed the England team for taking the knee. Ms Patel declined to comment onhis tweet,external, but Downing Street said the home secretary was ""working every day to clamp down on hate crime, racism and violence"". Mings, who was a member of the England Euros squad, was angered by a perceived lack of action by the government when some fans booed the players taking the knee before the tournament. The act of taking the knee has become a prominent symbol in sport and during anti-racist protests in recent years, and England players have been adopting the stance at the start of their matches. Speaking to GB News,externalabout the England players' protest in June, Ms Patel said she did not support ""people participating in that type of gesture politics"". Asked if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee she said: ""That's a choice for them, quite frankly."" Latest as England stars respond to racist abuse I won't apologise for who I am - Rashford What is taking the knee and why was it an issue at Euro 2020? Writing on Twitter on Monday evening, Mings said: ""You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' and then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against, happens."".

PM failed leadership test on racism - Starmer,"England's Tyrone Mings at a training session England footballer Tyrone Mings has accused the home secretary of pretending to be disgusted by racist abuse, after she previously described taking the knee as ""gesture politics"". Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they missed penalties in the Euro 2020 final. Priti Patel said she was ""disgusted"" by the online abuse directed at the trio. Mings said she had ""stoked the fire"" by refusing to criticise fans who booed the England team for taking the knee. Ms Patel declined to comment onhis tweet,external, but Downing Street said the home secretary was ""working every day to clamp down on hate crime, racism and violence"". Mings, who was a member of the England Euros squad, was angered by a perceived lack of action by the government when some fans booed the players taking the knee before the tournament. The act of taking the knee has become a prominent symbol in sport and during anti-racist protests in recent years, and England players have been adopting the stance at the start of their matches. Speaking to GB News,externalabout the England players' protest in June, Ms Patel said she did not support ""people participating in that type of gesture politics"". Asked if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee she said: ""That's a choice for them, quite frankly."" Latest as England stars respond to racist abuse I won't apologise for who I am - Rashford What is taking the knee and why was it an issue at Euro 2020? Writing on Twitter on Monday evening, Mings said: ""You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' and then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against, happens."".

Basic Welsh to be required for government jobs,"People will need to speak at least a ""courtesy"" level of basic Welsh in order to get jobs with the Welsh government in future. This includes answering the phone bilingually, as well as pronouncing and understanding simple words. Candidates will be expected to show the skills either on appointment or within six months of recruitment. The Conservatives said the government's priority ""should be recruiting the best person for the job"". The move is part of what the Welsh government called a ""significant change"" to its recruitment policies, as part of an aim to become bilingual. Job adverts for civil servants working in the Cathays Park administration will no longer say Welsh language skills are not required, but that it will be ""desirable, essential or to be taught on the post"" for every vacancy or new post. Helping young children learn Welsh more quickly How TV moves in when civil servants move out The Welsh government's Cymraeg 2050 plan,which aims to increase the number of Welsh speakers to one million, includes civil servants being able to understand the language. All posts advertised will require people to demonstrate at least a basic ""courtesy"" level of Welsh language skills ""within an agreed timeframe"" - usually within six months of starting. Courtesy-level Welsh is defined as an ability to: Pronounce Welsh-language words, names, place names and terms Answer the phone bilingually, greet people or make introductions bilingually Understand and use proactively everyday expressions and simple key words Read and understand short texts providing basic information, for example in correspondence, or to interpret the content using technology Demonstrate language awareness - which includes an appreciation of the importance of the language in society and an awareness of what is required to provide bilingual customer service A Welsh Conservative spokesman said the party was ""committed to delivering one million Welsh speakers, but at a time of national recovery, the Welsh government's priority should be recruiting the best person for the job"". ""Currently a large majority of people in Wales - nearly three-quarters - do not speak Welsh, but that shouldn't prohibit them from working in the civil service and contributing to Welsh public life."" This video can not be played How do you run Welsh Government when social distancing? There were 34 million page views of the Welsh government's website in English over the past year, compared to 652,000 in Welsh. Ministers' private offices received 41,037 items of correspondence - 970 (2.36%) were in Welsh. Of the phone calls received from outside the Welsh government, 4.3% were in Welsh and 95.7% were in English. The Welsh government said ""everyone has the potential to be a Welsh speaker and this strategy does not conflict with our commitment to being open, inclusive and diverse"" It said, although Welsh-language skills will progressively be needed for more posts, ""developing a bilingual workforce does not mean (or imply) those skills being a universal pre-requisite for joining the Welsh government"". It also said it would be ""investing in staff and providing opportunities to learn Welsh and develop language skills"", as well as people being given ""both time and motivation"" to improve their skills. Since 2018, all posts advertised in the Senedd Commission - which runs the Welsh Parliament from day to day and is separate from the government - also required ""at least a basic level"" of Welsh, with candidates ""expected to either evidence those skills on appointment or commit to gain those skills as part of the induction process"". There are about 5,500 full time equivalent staff at the Welsh government. Of the 112 posts advertised externally during 2020-21, 25 deemed Welsh language skills not necessary, 64 desirable, three ""learnt on appointment"" and 20 essential. Between 2020 and 2021, there was a 44% increase in requests from Welsh government staff for weekly Welsh lessons.

Dozens held after Cuban anti-government protests,"This video can not be played Thousands took to the streets in protest over the government's handling of coronavirus and the economy Dozens of people have been arrested in Cuba after thousands joined the biggest protests for decades against the island's Communist government, media and opposition sources say. Unauthorised public gatherings are illegal in Cuba and protests are rare. Images on social media showed what appeared to be security forces detaining, beating and pepper-spraying some of the protesters. Cuba's president labelled those protesting ""mercenaries"". In a four-hour-long televised address President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel slammed protestors as ""counter-revolutionaries"" while his foreign minister alleged the demonstrations had been financed and instigated by the United States. Three key issues that explain Cuba's rare protests Internet sheds light on Cuba anger - until it goes dark Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros But those who took to the streets said they were angry about the collapse of the economy, food and medicine shortages, price hikes and the government's handling of Covid-19. The government's response to the demonstrations was swift. Figures compiled by legal help centre Cubalex suggest around 100 people were arrested on Sunday. Among those detained is journalist Camila Acosta who was covering the protests for Spanish newspaper ABC. Spanish Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares demanded her immediate release. A young man who only gave his name as Carlos Alberto told BBC News Mundo he was hiding at his girlfriend's home after taking part in a demonstration. ""A colleague of mine was arrested, they came to look for him at his home. I'm afraid the same thing could happen to me,"" he said. ""We weren't doing anything bad, we're just asking for freedom and with this attitude they're showing what they are: a dictatorship,"" he told BBC Mundo's Lioman Lima over the phone. There were reports of internet blackouts across the island. Access to mobile internet was rolled out in December 2018 in Cuba but is controlled by the state-owned telecommunications company Etecsa. Internet monitoring site Netblocks said access to WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram had been restricted by Etecsa's servers. Mobile internet is the main way for Cubans to access independent news and many said the blackouts had increased the sense of ominous unease following the protests. There also appeared to be a heightened presence of security forces with one Havana resident reporting that ""the streets are full of police"". ""There are police at every corner and practically all you see going past is police patrols."" RamÃ³n Espinosa, a photographer with AP news agency, was injured while covering the protests Security forces detained people who took part in the demonstrations With messaging services down and dozens of people arrested, relatives of some of those detained gathered in front of police stations for news of their loved ones. Ariel GonzÃ¡lez told BBC News Mundo he had been to his local police station twice to enquire about his son, a 21-year-old student who was arrested during the protests. ""I knew he got roughed up because some of his friends who were with him told me. At the police station they told me they couldn't tell me where he is because he was taken by another 'institution',"" he said referring to the presence of plainclothes officers at the protests. Many of those attending the protests on Sunday complained about shortages ""There is no food, no medicine, there is no freedom. They do not let us live,"" one man named only as Alejandro said. Protesters also shouted ""freedom"" and ""down with the dictatorship"". President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel blamed the US sanctions on Cuba - which have been in place in various forms since 1962 - for the shortages, calling them a ""policy of economic suffocation"". The US - which has a decades-old history of hostilities with Cuba - has said it stands with Cubans, and called on those in government to refrain from violence and listen to its people. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" US President Joe Biden said. The anti-government protests began with a demonstration in the city of San Antonio de los BaÃ±os, south-west of Havana, but soon spread throughout the country. Many were broadcast live on social networks. Posts on social media showed people overturning police cars and looting some state-owned shops which price their goods in foreign currencies. For many Cubans, these shops are the only way they can buy basic necessities but prices are high. Some protesters targeted police vehicles and state-owned shops Cuba's economy is struggling. Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by the restrictions on travel during the Covid pandemic. Sugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected. As a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy in imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do. Are you taking part in the protests?

I won't apologise for who I am - Rashford,"Marcus Rashford was one of three players to miss a penalty for England in the 3-2 shootout defeat at Wembley England forward Marcus Rashford apologised for his penalty miss but said he ""will never apologise for who I am"" after he was one of three players subjected to racist abuse following England's Euro 2020 final defeat. Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka missed their spot-kicks as Italy won 3-2 in a shootout after a 1-1 draw. All three players were targeted on social media after the game. ""I felt as if I'd let everyone down,""Rashford wrote in a statement.,external The 23-year-old Manchester United attacker added: ""I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. ""I've felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of tens of thousands."" England's Tyrone Mings criticises Patel over racism response Hundreds of messages left on Rashford mural Hate Won't Win: Your messages of appreciation to England team Why abuse remains rife on social media Southgate keen to lead England to Qatar but feels like 'stomach has been ripped out' Pupils tell England team 'You're all heroes to us' A mural in Rashford's hometown of Withington was defaced after his penalty miss, before it was covered in messages of support. On Monday, England boss Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse was ""unforgivable"", and Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Messages of support were posted on a Marcus Rashford mural in his hometown after it was initially defaced Marcus Rashford's statement in full: ""I don't even know where to start and I don't even know how to put into words how I am feeling at this exact time. ""I've had a difficult season, I think that's been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. I've always backed myself for a penalty, but something didn't feel quite right. ""During the long run-up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my team-mates down. I felt as if I'd let everyone down. A penalty was all I'd been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep, so why not that one? ""It's been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and there's probably not a word to quite describe how it feels. Final. 55 years. 1 penalty. History. All I can say is sorry. I wish it had of gone differently. ""Whilst I continue to say sorry I want to shout out my team-mates. This summer has been one of the best camps I've experienced and you've all played a role in that. ""A brotherhood has been built that is unbreakable. Your success is my success. Your failures are mine. ""I've grown into a sport where I expected to read things written about myself. ""Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch. ""I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. I've felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of tens of thousands. ""I dreamt of days like this. The messages I've received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. ""I'm Marcus Rashford, 23-year-old black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that. For all the kind messages thank you. I'll be back stronger. We'll be back stronger."" This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) says shared data with Channel 4 news after the Euro 2020 final highlighted that more than 850,000 tweets were analysed across the whole tournament and showed: 1,913 flagged as potentially abusive, specifically targeting Sancho, Saka, Rashford and Raheem Sterling. 167 posts were considered to be ""high-risk"" abuse. The PFA said that, while a number of these tweets were delete, the accounts have not been permanently suspended by Twitter. ""Our preliminary analysis suggests the volume of abuse flagged around the Euro 2020 final, aimed mainly at Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling, was higher than the rest of the tournament combined,"" the PFA added. Twitter said it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Facebook said it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. England captain Harry Kane has told those behind the racist abuse of Rashford, Sancho and Saka: ""You're not an England fan and we don't want you."" The Tottenham striker addedon Twitter:,external""They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night. ""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up and take a pen when the stakes were high. ""If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you."" Defender Tyrone Mings also used Twitter to talk of his pride in the team reaching the final but added: ""Waking up today and seeing my brothers being racially abused for being brave enough to put themselves in a position to help this country, is something that sickens, but doesn't surprise me."" He went on tocriticise Home Secretary Priti Patel,who last month described players taking the knee against racism as ""gesture politics"".

All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss to Italy in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. They were targeted on social media after the game.

He went on to criticise Home Secretary Priti Patel who last month described players taking the knee against racism as ""gesture politics"". Earlier, manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse issued after the defeat was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council Football Policing Lead, said police were working with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter ""and enquiries are already being progressed"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out."" England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together. So proud to have team-mates with such top character. As for the racism, hurtful but not surprising. Will never get bored of saying that more needs to be done. Educate and control the platforms."" Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford missed penalties in England's shootout defeat European football's governing bodyUefacondemned the ""disgusting racist abuse"", adding: ""We stand by the players and the FA's call for the strongest possible punishments."" On Monday, League Two sideLeyton Orientsaid they had banned a fan for life in connection with the abuse. ""The supporter in question's actions on Twitter were alerted to the club late last night, and action has been taken swiftly to issue a banning order,"" the club said. Meanwhile, Premier League sideWolvessaid they had passed details to police after being alerted to racist abuse from one of their supporters. And a parish councillor in Shropshire has resigned after racist posts appeared on his personal Facebook page in the wake of England's defeat. Paul Bradbury, a member of Pontesbury Parish Council, said his account had been hacked. West Mercia Police said it had arrested a man in his 60s from Minsterley, Shropshire, on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and he remained in police custody. England had reached their first final in a major tournament since winning the World Cup in 1966 and, despite taking the lead against Italy, drew 1-1 after extra time before a penalty shootout. ""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,""said the prime minister.,external He later started a Downing Street briefing by praising the players, adding: ""They brought joy to this country and to those who have been directing racist abuse I say 'shame on you and I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged'."" England's players have taken a knee before games at the Euros to highlight the fight against racial inequality. On the day the tournament started on 11 June,the prime minister did not condemn fanswho jeered when England players took the knee during two warm-up games.

TheFAsaid it was ""appalled"" by the ""online racism"" directed at the three players following the defeat at Wembley. It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. ""We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences.

In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

Southgate keen to lead England to Qatar,"This video can not be played 'It feels like my stomach's been ripped out' - Southgate speaks after Euro 2020 final defeat England manager Gareth Southgate says he hopes to guide the team to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but needs time to rest before considering contract talks. Southgate spoke to media on the morning afterEngland's Euro 2020 final shootout lossto Italy and said he felt like his ""stomach has been ripped out"". He is under contract until after the 2022 winter World Cup, and the Football Association is keen torenew his deal. ""As I sit here today, I would want to be taking the team to Qatar,"" he said. ""We of course have to qualify for Qatar. I need some time to watch last night's game again, to reflect on the tournament. ""I need a rest. It's an amazing experience to lead your country in these tournaments, but it takes its toll."" Southgate was visibly dejected as he addressed the media about 12 hours after England's dramatic Wembley defeat in the country's first major men's final since the 1966 World Cup. He stressed his desire to not rush contract talks was ""not financial"" and that it was ""great"" to have the Football Association's ""internal support"".

""I feel we've made progress over four years. A lot of things we've done right and we know this team isn't at its peak yet. ""When you're in sport and you get to finals, those opportunities are so rare, so to be close, it's very hard the day after. You have given everything - the emotions are drained. ""We will go again. It's too easy to say we can go to the World Cup in Qatar and win - that's a bit glib. We still have to qualify. You have to start the cycle again. ""But to be able to work with these players every day has been fantastic, so when it comes to the end like it has now, it's hard."" England had one of the youngest squads at Euro 2020, fuelling hope some of the country's young talents will develop further by the time the 2022 World Cup begins. Southgate disagreed when asked if England were ""too nice"" to win the biggest tournaments, insisting teams would not be able to reach the final if that were the case. ""All of this team can go again but the young ones are still two to four years from peaking,"" he added. ""I know as I reflect over the coming days there are a huge number of positives and these players will be far better for going through so many important wins and landmarks.""

""They're so supportive of Gareth,"" Smith told BBC Sport. ""They've lived through all the hardships. Football is not always on an upward strip, it has lots of downs. I saw last night the character of the family watching the penalties. They didn't duck away from it, they watched it. ""It was great seeing Gareth come in after and just saying 'hello mum and dad, hello darling' - because they've been away so long. It shows the merit of that family. ""I think this is a chance now for him to push on. He is a workaholic and he will be back in on Wednesday thinking of the games that are coming up.

Truck driver visa options under discussion,"The government has explored ways to address a shortage of haulage workers, including creating a short-term visa scheme for foreign lorry drivers, the BBC understands. A combination of the Covid pandemic and Brexit has left haulage firms struggling to recruit drivers. Different government departments have discussed options with the industry, including bringing in such visas. But the Home Office said there are no plans to introduce the visas. The industry is pushing for drivers to be added to the so-called Shortage Occupations list, allowing them to qualify for a skilled worker visa. ""We need long-term solutions to recruit a new generation of British lorry drivers into the trade, but short-term there is an urgent need for foreign drivers to be allowed in, under the Shortage Occupations list,"" said Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy at the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The government wants the industry to employ British hauliers. But the industry said that it was impractical in the short term because of the immediacy of the need and the training costs involved. Last week, transport minister Baroness Vere said she had discussed this issue with the haulage sector two years ago, adding: ""It was very clear then that foreign labour would not be available to it."" Nevertheless, with the training for an HGV driver typically taking six to nine months, people within the industry insist urgent action is needed to overcome the immediate crisis. Businesses have warned that as the economy reopens, a lack of drivers is jeopardising deliveries to retailers and pushing up prices for consumers. The sector is suffering from the impact of the pandemic, which prevented thousands of new drivers from taking their tests last year. At the same time, many foreign hauliers returned home when work dried up during the early stages of the Covid outbreak and have since been unable to return because of immigration rules brought in after Brexit. The RHA estimates that there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 hauliers and said that the situation for food supplies was ""close to a crisis point"". There was a risk that some items would run out in supermarkets at certain times in a way similar to ""rolling blackouts"" for electricity, it said. ""We're seeing a real danger to our supplies in the UK because of driver shortages,"" said Mr McKenzie. With the government set to lift almost all legal restrictions on social contact in England on 19 July, the further opening of the economy could lead to a ""day of reckoning"", he said. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? Brexit: Lorry driver shortage could mean higher prices in shops Brexit and Covid cause big jump in pay for lorry drivers While the industry has been increasing wages to try to attract staff, it is limited by slim profit margins, Mr McKenzie said. It costs thousands of pounds to train up drivers and that is out of reach of many haulage firms and prospective drivers, he added. Alex Veitch, general manager of public policy at industry body Logistics UK, said the situation ""has become a crisis"". ""We need government to provide funding for driver training to open the industry up to as many people as possible and deliver their commitment to provide safe, secure parking for drivers. ""Meanwhile, without a temporary visa for drivers  - similar to that recently granted to agricultural workers to pick vital crops - the supply chain will break down,"" he said. The government has already relaxed strict limits on driving timeto allow hauliers to work for longer each day. However, while that plan has been welcomed by wholesalers, it has faced criticism on safety grounds. ""Extending lorry drivers' hours, as the government is doing, is a bad idea. Tired drivers don't make better drivers or safer roads,"" Mr McKenzie said. PM urges caution as 19 July unlocking set to proceed Why are lorry drivers getting big pay rises?

'For us it's not freedom day',"Rosie, 74, says she's absolutely furious that no thought has been given to people classed as clinically extremely vulnerable The end of England's lockdown rules on 19 July has been dubbed ""Freedom Day"" - but for some people, it's becoming a day to dread. ""For us it's not freedom day, is it?"" says Rosie Duffin, 74, from Fareham, in Hampshire. ""It's 'becoming a hermit day' once again. It might be freedom for others, definitely not for us."" The retired NHS worker has secondary breast cancer and is considered clinically extremely vulnerable. Although she's been vaccinated, she says she was horrified when she heard that face masks may no longer be required. ""It doesn't make sense really, does it?"" she says. ""I don't see the problem with wearing face masks. When it comes to my own protection, and the protection of others, surely it's a small thing to do."" Rosie says she is now planning to cancel trips and events she had planned. ""I've got a theatre trip booked but there's no way I'm going to be sitting in a theatre next to people who are not wearing masks,"" she says. And she will no longer travel to London to see family, who she hasn't seen since 2019. ""It's frightening that freedom from masks will inevitably diminish my freedom to participate in daily life."" And she's not alone. What rules are set to change? Unions warn workers at risk if face masks dropped The government's advice for clinically extremely vulnerable people - who number 3.7 million in England -was last updated a fortnight ago and says,externalthey should be cautious. However, some are already facing the prospect of having to shield for longer. While the vaccine offers a level of protection against Covid-19 for most people, for an estimated 500,000 in the UK - with a range of medical conditions - the jabs are unlikely to work. For them, freedom feels a long way away. ""It's kind of like belonging to an exclusive club that no one wants to belong to,"" says Margaret Bennett. The retired teacher from Birmingham was diagnosed 17 years ago with common variable immune deficiency - a condition that means she cannot properly make antibodies to fight infection. It meant she struggled for decades with frequent and lingering illnesses, which interfered with her life and work. But a treatment was available. Called immunoglobulin replacement therapy, it takes blood plasma from hundreds of donors, combining it and extracting the antibodies. The treatment shared the general population's immunity to common infections with her and other people with similar conditions. Then Covid-19 emerged. ""The treatment that I was getting was allowing me to lead a normal life. And now I can't,"" the 68-year-old says. Covid vaccine tested in people with weak immunity Jab trialled for people who cannot be vaccinated Patients with low immunity anxious despite vaccine About 5,000 people have genetic immune disorders like Margaret's. For them, the vaccine remains safe and patients have been advised to take it, just in case it offers some degree of protection. But many don't know if it will work. The uncertainty means they must now wait: for vaccinations to be so widespread that the virus is no longer circulating, for the results of trials testing the effectiveness of cloned antibodies, or for Covid-19 antibodies to eventually appear in donated blood. But immunoglobulin replacement therapy given today is made from blood donated months ago. There is little sign of it offering protection to Covid yet. ""We're sort of stuck in this situation until 2022,"" says Margaret. ""We haven't got any definite end to it, which is the hardest thing to manage, particularly as you see all your other friends suddenly able to do things that you wouldn't do. We tend to feel we've been forgotten."" Margaret says she expects to stay shielding until 2022 For her, there is no end in sight to shielding. She last saw one of her daughters who lives in America in February 2020. She has not hugged her grandchildren since the pandemic began. She still leaves deliveries from the postman for 48 hours before touching them. Social life has been limited to meeting her daughter in the garden and attending a small birthday party outside - where she brought her own food and cutlery. Margaret and her husband are each keenly aware of the effect the situation has on each other. He is relieved that, now vaccinated, essential trips outside the home carry less risk of bringing back the virus. However, some relationships haven't survived. Hannah Butler's partner, Wes, only knew her since she had been having treatment for her hypogammaglobulinemia - a ""very long and complicated name"" for a condition which means she has a very low levels of antibodies and is unlikely to respond to Covid vaccines. Hannah says the UK's strategy seems reliant on vaccines, without acknowledging they don't work for everyone Wes moved in with Hannah at her parent's house in Surrey during the first lockdown when he lost his job. But when he got a new job, just as infections around the country began to rise again, it wasn't safe for them to live together, or even to see each other. ""The strategy at the moment seems to be, as long as you've got the vaccine, you're fine,"" the 24-year-old says. ""And if you're young, you're not really at risk. It would be good in the middle of that to acknowledge that not everyone is OK after the vaccine, not everyone is protected."" Angela Steatham, who has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, says that tests have shown her vaccination produced ""zero antibodies"" - meaning she is still unprotected. Throughout more than 450 days of shielding, Angela and her partner Simon had lived separate lives in her cottage in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Powys. But when they found out about the vaccine being ineffective, they decided to separate for good. Angela say she may have to face years living a restricted life in her cottage in Wales to stay safe ""The only way we could sort of cohabit is if Simon lived the same reclusive life as me, but he's got four kids, he's got an elderly mother,"" Angela says. ""It's just impossible to maintain a loving, intimate relationship when you can't even be in the same room together. I don't want him to live the rest of his life restricted - I don't think he wants to either."" Now Angela is braced for living a highly restricted life, perhaps for years, if the virus continues to circulate. ""We will have more variants. I don't think it's a question of if - we've got the whole Greek alphabet to go through,"" Angela says. People with conditions like hers risk becoming ""a marginalised group in society"", she fears.

Racist abuse of players 'unforgiveable' says Southgate,"This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate England manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse aimed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss and were targeted on social media after the game. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out."" England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together. So proud to have team-mates with such top character. As for the racism, hurtful but not surprising. Will never get bored of saying that more needs to be done. Educate and control the platforms."" Boris Johnson failed leadership test over taking the knee, says Keir Starmer Why abuse remains rife on social media Southgate keen to lead England to Qatar but feels like 'stomach has been ripped out' Marcus Rashford mural defaced after England Euro 2020 defeat 'It is down to me' - Southgate rallies round England penalty trio Pupils tell England team 'You're all heroes to us' Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford missed penalties in England's shootout defeat European football's governing bodyUefacondemned the ""disgusting racist abuse"", adding: ""We stand by the players and the FA's call for the strongest possible punishments."" On Monday, League Two sideLeyton Orientsaid they had banned a fan for life in connection with the abuse. ""The supporter in question's actions on Twitter were alerted to the club late last night, and action has been taken swiftly to issue a banning order,"" the club said. England had reached their first final in a major tournament since winning the World Cup in 1966 and, despite taking the lead against Italy, drew 1-1 after extra time before a penalty shootout. ""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,""said the prime minister.,external He later started a Downing Street briefing by praising the players, adding: ""They brought joy to this country and to those who have been directing racist abuse I say 'shame on you and I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged'."" England's players have taken a knee before games at the Euros to highlight the fight against racial inequality. On the day the tournament started on 11 June,the prime minister did not condemn fanswho jeered when England players took the knee during two warm-up games. Instead, Johnson said he wanted to see fans ""getting behind the team to cheer them on"" - and was then accused of not having ""the guts to call it out"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

TheFAsaid it was ""appalled"" by the ""online racism"" directed at the three players following the defeat at Wembley. It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. ""We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. This video can not be played Sancho, Jorginho & Saka miss penalties as Italy edge England at Wembley ""Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse."" In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

Hope for long Covid tests,"Scientists say they have detected irregularities in the blood of long Covid patients that could one day pave the way for a test for the condition. Imperial College London researchers found a pattern of rogue antibodies in the blood of a small number of people with long Covid. They hope it could lead to a simple blood test within six to 18 months. Dr Elaine Maxwell, from the National Institute of Health Research, said the early findings were ""exciting"". She said there could be ""a number of different things happening after a Covid-19 infection"" and an autoimmune response ""has been one of the suspected mechanisms"". But she warned that long Covid was a ""complex condition"", saying it was important to continue to research the other causal factors so all different types of post-Covid syndrome could be diagnosed and treated. Long Covid is not yet fully understoodand can cover a range of symptoms lasting long after initial infection including fatigue, breathlessness, headaches and muscle pain. There are currently no tests to diagnose long Covid. Prof Danny Altmann, who is leading the research team at Imperial, said he believes the work will lead to a test which could be done in a doctor's surgery. More than 2m in England may have had long Covid Long Covid: Fears others will suffer when restrictions end Patients call for long Covid clinics in Wales But he said he was concernedthe UK government's plans to ""live with"" Covid-19could be stoking the next wave of cases of the condition. The government plans to end most coronavirus restrictions in England in a week's time, on 19 July. But amid rising cases Prof Altmann warned that it is not yet known if vaccinations will protect people from long-term symptoms. ""If we're heading into a phase of 100,000 cases per day, and, we're saying that 10-20% of all infections can result in long Covid, I can see no certainty that we're not brewing those long Covid cases despite having a vaccinated population,"" he said. In the pilot study, researchers compared the blood of dozens of people and found what are called autoantibodies that were not present in people who recovered quickly, or those who have not had Covid-19. Normally, human immune systems create antibodies to fight disease. But sometimes the body turns on itself - creating the autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. Prof Altmann believes these autoantibodies may be one of the things causing long Covid symptoms. He said it is also possible that some people still have the virus ""persisting"" in their bodies, while others may have other problems with their immune systems. The research is still at an initial stage, meaning the research was done on a small sample size which can be scaled up later. Prof Altmann warned that the findings cannot yet be described as a breakthrough, but said they were ""a very exciting advancement"". An estimated 962,000 people in the UK had long Covid in the four weeks up to 4 June,according to data from the Office for National Statistics,external. And around 385,000 people in the UK are estimated to have been suffering with symptoms for more than a year. Long Covid can affect people of all ages, including children and people who were previously fit and healthy, as well as those who only experienced mild coronavirus symptoms at first. This video can not be played Itâs been more than a year, will I ever recover? - BBC reporter Lucy Adams explored long Covid in a Panorama film I am 44 years old - but in my body, I'm like someone twice my age. I caught Covid in March last year. Having long Covid means I wake up in pain and go to bed with pain. I have vertigo, migraines and blurred vision. After 11 hard months, I began to feel exactly as I had almost a year previously. I went for a test and that evening I got an email saying I had Covid again. Read Lucy's storyhere. In May, the UK government promised to set up 89 long Covid clinics to help patients with specialist care. The guidelines say these clinics should be doctor-led and should accept patients regardless of whether they had needed hospital treatment for Covid-19. However, BBC Panorama found some clinics are not staffed by doctors - and four of them only see patients who were originally hospitalised with Covid. Ten clinics had patients who had been waiting more than 100 days and the longest wait was more than six months, at 191 days. In response, NHS England said it has ""invested more than Â£134 million"" in long Covid services and is setting up 15 paediatric hubs. Neither Scotland nor Wales have specialised clinics. Both told the BBC they were strengthening existing services. Scotland said it was investing in Â£2.5m in research. Northern Ireland's first long Covid clinics will open in October. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: ""The government rapidly provided specialist care for acutely ill Covid-19 patients at the start of the pandemic and we've matched that speed and scale in our support for people with long Covid."" They said they had backed scientists with over Â£50m for research to better understand the long-term effects.

Super Mario game sells for record-breaking $1.5m,"A sealed copy of video game Super Mario 64 has sold at auction for more than $1.5m (Â£1.1m), shattering records. The 1996 cartridge was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 console, and was one of the most influential early 3D platformers. The auction house said there were ""fewer than five"" copies in such good condition. The sale dwarfed another record-breaker, an original Legend of Zelda cartridge, set just two days before. That original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridge sold for $870,000 on Friday, briefly making it the world's most expensive game. Neither game was bought for the rarity of its gameplay experience - Nintendo has rereleased both for its Nintendo Switch console. Instead, they have value as physical memorabilia, in the same way as rare trading cards. Rare 'Nintendo PlayStation' sells for Â£230,000 The 'insane' money in trading collectible cards How do you work out what something is worth? The Super Mario 64 cartridge was gradedby video game collectable firm Wata,externalat a 9.8 A++ rating - meaning it is both in near-perfect condition and its seal is intact and ""like new"". A high rating is not enough to guarantee a high auction price - although it helps. Another copy of Super Mario 64 in the same auction with a 9.6 A++ rating sold for a comparatively affordable $13,200. But rarer copies of more popular games attract the most bids. Super Mario 64 was the best-selling game for the Nintendo 64 system, and is widely seen as an important game in video game history. It marked Mario's first move into three dimensions, distinct from his side-scrolling origins. While many modern gamers feel it has not aged particularly well and is widely thought to have significant camera issues, it is still considered among the best video games ever made. Heritage Auctions, the company behind the sale, was taken by surprise at the huge price it eventually attracted. Ahead of the auction, much of the attention had been on the rare Zelda cartridge. The 9.0 A-sealed copy of 1988's The Legend of Zelda was the first game in the series, and has gone on to be one of the best-performing and most critically-acclaimed in Nintendo's entire catalogue. It was expected to reach a high price because this copy belonged to an early production run - making it one of the first ever made to still exist. Heritage Auctions said that to its knowledge, only one earlier production copy is known to exist, and may never be put on sale. ""This copy [is] the earliest sealed copy anyone can realistically hope to obtain,"" it wrote. Many expressed surprise that the Mario cartridge - which sold millions and millions of copies - sold for so much. Kelsey Lewin, a director at California's Video Game History Foundation,tweeted:,external""despite a lack of population reports, there are many known sealed Super Mario 64 first prints"".

Video game collectables have been fetching higher and higher prices, leading some to question whether the market is over-inflated. The sale of the Zelda cartridge shattered the previous record, set in April for an original NES cartridge of Super Mario Bros, the first side-scrolling platformer featuring the famous plumber, which sold for $660,000. The record-breaking auction this week saw a huge range of collectable games go for high prices - a copy of Final Fantasy III for the Super Nintendo sold for $96,000, as did a copy of Zelda: A Link to the Past.

UK bans fifth neo-Nazi group under terror laws,"Members of ""The Base"" tried to groom teenagers in the UK and elsewhere as recruits An American neo-Nazi group which is led from Russia is to be banned as a terrorist organisation, the Home Secretary has said. Priti Patel condemned ""evil white supremacist groups, who target vulnerable people across the world"". The Base will be the fifth extreme right-wing group to be proscribed in the UK under anti-terror laws. Last year BBC Panoramaexposed the organisation's recruitments efforts in the UK. A BBC investigation also exposed the group's American founder Rinaldo Nazzaro andrevealed how he was directing The Base from his St Petersburg home. The Base, formed in 2018, seeks to create terrorist cells in the US and other countries in an attempt to establish fascist, white ethno-states through a ""race war"". US neo-Nazi directing group from Russia, BBC finds Teens groomed by neo-Nazi militant group Members have engaged in training with weapons and explosives. Several men linked to the group are being prosecuted in the US for offences including conspiracy to murder. The group has been heavily disrupted, although leading figures like Nazzaro remain active. A formal ban in the UK, which will come into force this week if approved by MPs, will make membership or support for the group a terrorism offence with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. The group is directed by Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former FBI and Pentagon employee who now lives in Russia The Home Office said the group shared aims and ideologies withAtomwaffen Division, and its alias National Socialist Order, which was banned earlier this year. The other right-wing extremist groups proscribed as terror organisations areNational ActionandSonnenkrieg Division- both created in the UK - as well asFeuerkrieg Division, founded in Estonia. The Panorama investigation into The Base exposed how Nazzaro and other men interviewed and groomed young recruits from Britain and other countries. The investigation showed how another leading group member, Matthew Baccari, ran a notorious neo-Nazi online forum linked to multiple terrorism prosecutions in UK courts. Nazzaro, who used to work for the FBI and the Pentagon, moved to Russia around the time he created The Base. In November a feature-length interview with Nazzaro was broadcast on Russian state television.

"Rothermere family mulls taking Daily Mail privateThe family, which owns 28% of the group, is looking to buy the rest of the news organisation.Business","The Rothermere family is considering making a bid to take the owner of the Daily Mail news group private. A formal offer is dependent on the Daily Mail and General Trust selling its insurance and Cazoo financial arms. The family founded the Daily Mail, which listed on the London stock market in 1932 and expanded into a multi-media business. A DMGT statement said,externalthat the directors were ""minded"" to accept the family's offer. Lord Rothermere is already the controlling shareholder of DMGT through a 28% stake owned by his family trust, RCL. After the sale of the financial assets, RCL would bid about Â£810m for the remainder of the smaller DMGT group. DMGT said it intended to distribute the proceeds of a sale of RMS along with its cash and its stake in a listed Cazoo via a special dividend, with a cash element of about 610p. Monday's DMGT statement said discussions to sell the insurance business were continuing, and if a deal was agreed, it could be completed in the third quarter of this year. It is unclear which companies are interested in buying the insurance division, RMS, but the statement said DMGT had received ""a number of inquiries from third parties"". In March, online car seller Cazoo Holdings, in which DMGT has a stake of around 20%, agreed to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company - a so-called Spac - which is expected to provide DMGT with cash and shares worth more than $1bn. The DMGT owns the Metro and i news operations, and also Daily Mail online, one of the most visited news websites in the world. Last year, the Daily Mail eclipsed the Sun as the UK's best-selling daily newspaper. The business traces its roots to 1896, when the Daily Mail was launched by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth. DMGT's shake-up is the latest in a string of deals, including the sale of its education business, Hobsons, energy data operation Genscape and property website Zoopla. Under stock market rules, Lord Rothermere now has until 9 August to make a formal offer or confirm no deal will be made. The Daily Mail has been - arguably - the most influential newspaper in Britain for the past three decades, cowing cabinet ministers and swaying policy with punchy reporting, relentless campaigns and its claim to be the voice of a silent conservative majority. Despite that influence, however, it is a relatively small part of Daily Mail and General Trust, the company that owns it. DMGT has a broad range of media interests, even after the rapid slimming down of recent years that has seen the sale of interests in online estate agencies and the offloading of financial information provider Euromoney. Now that slimming down will accelerate - and if the Rothermere family's bid goes through, the company's shares will be taken off the London Stock Exchange. DMGT has received an offer for one of its largest and most valuable businesses, RMS. It provides specialist information to insurance companies. DMGT's interest in Cazoo, the online car-sales company, will be spun off via a stock market listing in the US. Under the plan outlined this morning, the cash and shares from those two transactions will be handed back to investors, and Lord Rothermere's family company will then buy out all the other shareholders. The big question is why Lord Rothermere wants to do this. It should be possible to return cash to shareholders and keep DMGT as a listed company. Sources close to the DMGT camp this morning said the company had been difficult to value for public company investors and that these transactions would simplify its structure and return cash. That does not answer the question of the listing. Big shareholders normally take companies private when they wish to avoid all the disclosure and governance requirements that come with a stock exchange listing, or have a plan for a big shift in strategy or operations that will be easier to push through once they are the sole shareholder.

FA review after fans break into Wembley for final,"This video can not be played Video shows fans breaking through a Wembley Stadium entrance before the final The Football Association (FA) will conduct a full review after a ""large number of drunken yobs"" tried to force their way in to Wembley without tickets ahead of the Euro 2020 final. Fans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham apologised to legitimate fans who were affected and said the security team had ""never seen anything like it"". The Metropolitan Police said it worked with security to prevent breaches. TV audience of 31m watch England lose Euro final PM & FA condemn racist abuse of players Italy spoil England's 'coming home' party Mr Bullingham said he was not sure those who broke in were real fans. ""There were a large number of drunken yobs trying to force their way in, we run a stadium not a fortress,"" he said. ""I have to apologise to any fans whose experience was affected and any of the team who had to cope with this."" He said the FA would work with the police to ban anyone who had forced their way in and to prevent such an event happening again. Downing Street has criticised those who stormed the stadium without tickets. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Those scenes were unacceptable and we condemn violence, anti-social behaviour and abuse in the strongest possible terms."" Lis Nixon, 62, from Oxfordshire, who was at the match, said it was ""horrible"" and ""put you off going"". She said she was pushed and crushed while queuing to get into the stadium and said once inside, there were large numbers of ticketless fans in rows and blocking exits with some people so drunk they had fallen to the ground and were just left there. She said the stewards were ""overwhelmed"" and had ""lost control"" of the situation. Roberta Cuppari (right) with her friend at Wembley Italy supporter Roberta Cuppari said she and her friend had to watch the match crushed in a corner while being sworn at and abused after ticketless fans took their seats and refused to move. ""It was the worst thing I have ever seen,"" said the 38-year-old mother-of-three. ""There were people urinating, people doing drugs."" She said people had pushed through behind them at the entrance, refusing to show their tickets or proof of Covid tests but security had not done anything, even when she had called for help. Ms Cuppari, from Weybridge, Surrey, said it was unsafe and she was glad not to have brought her seven-year-old son, who would have been ""put off football for life"". A Football Association spokesperson initially denied anyone without a ticket had gained entry, saying there were ""no security breaches of people without tickets getting inside the stadium"". In a later statement, a stadium spokesperson said: ""There was a breach of security and a small group of people got into the stadium. ""We are now working closely with stadium stewards and security to remove these people. Anyone inside the stadium without a ticket will be instantly ejected."" Former footballer Dominic Matteo said he had decided not to go into Wembley, despite having a ticket for the match, because of concerns for safety having had health issues in recent years. He said he felt sorry for the stewards who were not equipped to deal with the situation with people ""running in from all different angles just up to no good"". ""It was very scary. I'm 47 years old, I'm a man, I can look after myself, but it felt very intimidating and them people trying to get in, they got in through the disabled entrance, which is scandalous,"" he said. A large crowd had also been trying to enter the fan zone in Trafalgar Square without tickets shortly before kick-off, the Met Police said. Police said they had been ""engaging with the crowd and telling them to disperse"". Some people inside Wembley said there had been fans standing on the concourse for the entire first half, watching the match. After the match, riot police could be seen breaking through crowds outside Wembley Stadium as fans departed. Beer bottles were thrown amid chants against Italy. The Met Police said there had been 45 arrests by officers policing the final, with 19 officers injured ""while they confronted volatile crowds"". Police forces across the country said they had been called to 875 incidents relating to the match - more than double the number during any previous football tournament. There were 246 arrests. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the ""violent minority"" who assaulted officers were not ""true fans"". The FA, prime minister and Duke of Cambridge have alsocondemned the racist abuseaimed at penalty-takers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. The UK Football Policing Unit said it had launched an investigation to identify those posting racist abuse on social media. By Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football reporter The unsavoury scenes at Wembley before and during England's Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy were the result of an uneasy, threatening undercurrent of tension that had been building up throughout the day. Several hours before kick-off, thousands of fans, many fuelled by alcohol, were packed into areas around the stadium in an increasingly frenzied atmosphere that always threatened to get out of hand. Security was ineffective and it is rare at a major final for supporters to be able to get so close to the stadium without tickets. I was offered money for my accreditation lanyard just yards from the media entrance - unthinkable at any such showpiece event I have previously attended. Inevitably, the situation boiled over into the frightening sight of barriers being stormed by scores of ticketless fans desperate to get inside Wembley, with children left terrified, others knocked to the ground, aisles full and the area reserved for disabled spectators swamped with supporters looking for anywhere to sit. Fans who had legitimately paid to watch England's first major final for 55 years were left struggling to watch the game. Stewards, perhaps understandably, were overwhelmed by the numbers they were having to deal with. It certainly did not appear to be a ""small group"" as originally stated. Were you at Wembley?

Early findings bring hope for long Covid tests,"Scientists say they have detected irregularities in the blood of long Covid patients that could one day pave the way for a test for the condition. Imperial College London researchers found a pattern of rogue antibodies in the blood of a small number of people with long Covid. They hope it could lead to a simple blood test within six to 18 months. Dr Elaine Maxwell, from the National Institute of Health Research, said the early findings were ""exciting"". She said there could be ""a number of different things happening after a Covid-19 infection"" and an autoimmune response ""has been one of the suspected mechanisms"". But she warned that long Covid was a ""complex condition"", saying it was important to continue to research the other causal factors so all different types of post-Covid syndrome could be diagnosed and treated. Long Covid is not yet fully understoodand can cover a range of symptoms lasting long after initial infection including fatigue, breathlessness, headaches and muscle pain. There are currently no tests to diagnose long Covid. Prof Danny Altmann, who is leading the research team at Imperial, said he believes the work will lead to a test which could be done in a doctor's surgery. More than 2m in England may have had long Covid Long Covid: Fears others will suffer when restrictions end Patients call for long Covid clinics in Wales But he said he was concernedthe UK government's plans to ""live with"" Covid-19could be stoking the next wave of cases of the condition. The government plans to end most coronavirus restrictions in England in a week's time, on 19 July. But amid rising cases Prof Altmann warned that it is not yet known if vaccinations will protect people from long-term symptoms. ""If we're heading into a phase of 100,000 cases per day, and, we're saying that 10-20% of all infections can result in long Covid, I can see no certainty that we're not brewing those long Covid cases despite having a vaccinated population,"" he said. In the pilot study, researchers compared the blood of dozens of people and found what are called autoantibodies that were not present in people who recovered quickly, or those who have not had Covid-19. Normally, human immune systems create antibodies to fight disease. But sometimes the body turns on itself - creating the autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. Prof Altmann believes these autoantibodies may be one of the things causing long Covid symptoms. He said it is also possible that some people still have the virus ""persisting"" in their bodies, while others may have other problems with their immune systems. The research is still at an initial stage, meaning the research was done on a small sample size which can be scaled up later. Prof Altmann warned that the findings cannot yet be described as a breakthrough, but said they were ""a very exciting advancement"". An estimated 962,000 people in the UK had long Covid in the four weeks up to 4 June,according to data from the Office for National Statistics,external. And around 385,000 people in the UK are estimated to have been suffering with symptoms for more than a year. Long Covid can affect people of all ages, including children and people who were previously fit and healthy, as well as those who only experienced mild coronavirus symptoms at first. This video can not be played Itâs been more than a year, will I ever recover? - BBC reporter Lucy Adams explored long Covid in a Panorama film I am 44 years old - but in my body, I'm like someone twice my age. I caught Covid in March last year. Having long Covid means I wake up in pain and go to bed with pain. I have vertigo, migraines and blurred vision. After 11 hard months, I began to feel exactly as I had almost a year previously. I went for a test and that evening I got an email saying I had Covid again. Read Lucy's storyhere. In May, the UK government promised to set up 89 long Covid clinics to help patients with specialist care. The guidelines say these clinics should be doctor-led and should accept patients regardless of whether they had needed hospital treatment for Covid-19. However, BBC Panorama found some clinics are not staffed by doctors - and four of them only see patients who were originally hospitalised with Covid. Ten clinics had patients who had been waiting more than 100 days and the longest wait was more than six months, at 191 days. In response, NHS England said it has ""invested more than Â£134 million"" in long Covid services and is setting up 15 paediatric hubs. Neither Scotland nor Wales have specialised clinics. Both told the BBC they were strengthening existing services. Scotland said it was investing in Â£2.5m in research. Northern Ireland's first long Covid clinics will open in October. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: ""The government rapidly provided specialist care for acutely ill Covid-19 patients at the start of the pandemic and we've matched that speed and scale in our support for people with long Covid."" They said they had backed scientists with over Â£50m for research to better understand the long-term effects.

Why abuse remains rife on social media,"Once again, social-media companies are facing criticism as their platforms are used toracially abuse football players, following the dramatic conclusion of the Euro 2020 men's tournament on Sunday night. And make no mistake, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the technology giants to defend these incidents. How can they not be held more responsible for the content they share to millions? In a nutshell, social-media platforms have not been regulated in the same way as traditional media such as the BBC, because they are not categorised as publishers or broadcasters. If racist comments appeared below this article, written not by me but by someone who had read it, the BBC would be immediately accountable, as part ofan arrangement with the regulator Ofcom,external. But Ofcom does not yet have powers over the likes of Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, which have until now been largely self-regulating -although, that is coming, as part of the long-anticipated Online Safety Bill. Whether the threat of large fines is enough to focus the minds of these multi-million dollar businesses remains to be seen, however. Butit is not just in the UK that regulation is planned. In fairness, while the BBC does have a large global presence, it does not have to deal with anything like the volume of content and video, written and uploaded in real time by anybody and everybody, a platform such as Facebook, with its two billion users, does. Social-media platforms are looking to automation for answers This sheer volume swamps the armies of human moderators employed by those platforms. Some describe nightmare shiftssifting through the worst and most graphic content imaginable and then making decisions about what should be done with it. So, the solution these companies are all pouring countless time and money into is automation. Algorithms trained to seek out offensive material before it is published, the blanket banning of incendiary (and illegal) hashtags, the use of techniques such as ""hashing"", which create a kind of digital fingerprint of a video, and then block any content bearing the same marker, are already in regular use. But so far, automation remains a bit of a blunt instrument. It is not yet sophisticated enough to understand nuance, context, different cultural norms, crafty edits - and there would be very little support for an anonymous algorithm, built by an unelected US technology giant, effectively censoring Western people's speech without these factors (China of course has its own state censorship and US social-media platforms are banned). Match officials at a Premier League game last month wore T shirts bearing anti-abuse slogans Here is an example - a friend last night reported an anonymous account that had posted an orangutan emoji beneath an Instagram post belonging to England's Bukayo Saka. Now, nobody is going to blanket-ban that emoji. But in this context, and given Saka is a young black player whose penalty kick was one of those that failed in the deciding moments of the England v Italy Euro 2020 final, the intention is pretty clear. The response my friend received to her complaint was: ""Our technology has found that this probably doesn't go against our community guidelines,"" - although, it went on to add the automation ""isn't perfect"". She has appealed against the decision but who knows when it will get a pair of human eyes on it? On Twitter, meanwhile, a user was apparently able to use an extremely offensive racial slur in a tweet about a footballer, before deleting the message. In a statement, Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had ""quickly removed comments"" directed at players. ""No-one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere - and we don't want it on Instagram,"" it said. Twitter's response was similar - in 24 hours, it had removed 1,000 posts and blocked accounts sharing hateful content, using ""a combination of machine learning based automation and human review"", it said. Both companies also said they had tools and filters that could be activated to stop account holders from seeing abusive content - but this does not solve the problem of the content being shared in the first place. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight,"" Facebook added. And perhaps that is what really lies at the heart of all this - it is not necessarily the limitations of technology that are the issue but old-fashioned human nature. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, on Twitter ironically, those responsible for posting racist abuse should ""be ashamed of themselves"". Allow Twitter content?

Rothermere family mulls taking Daily Mail private,"The Rothermere family is considering making a bid to take the owner of the Daily Mail news group private. A formal offer is dependent on the Daily Mail and General Trust selling its insurance and Cazoo financial arms. The family founded the Daily Mail, which listed on the London stock market in 1932 and expanded into a multi-media business. A DMGT statement said,externalthat the directors were ""minded"" to accept the family's offer. Lord Rothermere is already the controlling shareholder of DMGT through a 28% stake owned by his family trust, RCL. After the sale of the financial assets, RCL would bid about Â£810m for the remainder of the smaller DMGT group. DMGT said it intended to distribute the proceeds of a sale of RMS along with its cash and its stake in a listed Cazoo via a special dividend, with a cash element of about 610p. Monday's DMGT statement said discussions to sell the insurance business were continuing, and if a deal was agreed, it could be completed in the third quarter of this year. It is unclear which companies are interested in buying the insurance division, RMS, but the statement said DMGT had received ""a number of inquiries from third parties"". In March, online car seller Cazoo Holdings, in which DMGT has a stake of around 20%, agreed to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company - a so-called Spac - which is expected to provide DMGT with cash and shares worth more than $1bn. The DMGT owns the Metro and i news operations, and also Daily Mail online, one of the most visited news websites in the world. Last year, the Daily Mail eclipsed the Sun as the UK's best-selling daily newspaper. The business traces its roots to 1896, when the Daily Mail was launched by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth. DMGT's shake-up is the latest in a string of deals, including the sale of its education business, Hobsons, energy data operation Genscape and property website Zoopla. Under stock market rules, Lord Rothermere now has until 9 August to make a formal offer or confirm no deal will be made. The Daily Mail has been - arguably - the most influential newspaper in Britain for the past three decades, cowing cabinet ministers and swaying policy with punchy reporting, relentless campaigns and its claim to be the voice of a silent conservative majority. Despite that influence, however, it is a relatively small part of Daily Mail and General Trust, the company that owns it. DMGT has a broad range of media interests, even after the rapid slimming down of recent years that has seen the sale of interests in online estate agencies and the offloading of financial information provider Euromoney. Now that slimming down will accelerate - and if the Rothermere family's bid goes through, the company's shares will be taken off the London Stock Exchange. DMGT has received an offer for one of its largest and most valuable businesses, RMS. It provides specialist information to insurance companies. DMGT's interest in Cazoo, the online car-sales company, will be spun off via a stock market listing in the US. Under the plan outlined this morning, the cash and shares from those two transactions will be handed back to investors, and Lord Rothermere's family company will then buy out all the other shareholders. The big question is why Lord Rothermere wants to do this. It should be possible to return cash to shareholders and keep DMGT as a listed company. Sources close to the DMGT camp this morning said the company had been difficult to value for public company investors and that these transactions would simplify its structure and return cash. That does not answer the question of the listing. Big shareholders normally take companies private when they wish to avoid all the disclosure and governance requirements that come with a stock exchange listing, or have a plan for a big shift in strategy or operations that will be easier to push through once they are the sole shareholder. Expect much speculation about whether Lord Rothermere has such a change in mind for the Daily Mail.

Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

Rothermere family set to take Daily Mail private,"The Rothermere family is considering making a bid to take the owner of the Daily Mail news group private. A formal offer is dependent on the Daily Mail and General Trust selling its insurance and Cazoo financial arms. The family founded the Daily Mail, which listed on the London stock market in 1932 and expanded into a multi-media business. A DMGT statement said,externalthat the directors were ""minded"" to accept the family's offer. Lord Rothermere is already the controlling shareholder of DMGT through a 28% stake owned by his family trust, RCL. After the sale of the financial assets, RCL would bid about Â£810m for the remainder of the smaller DMGT group. DMGT said it intended to distribute the proceeds of a sale of RMS along with its cash and its stake in a listed Cazoo via a special dividend, with a cash element of about 610p. Monday's DMGT statement said discussions to sell the insurance business were continuing, and if a deal was agreed, it could be completed in the third quarter of this year. It is unclear which companies are interested in buying the insurance division, RMS, but the statement said DMGT had received ""a number of inquiries from third parties"". In March, online car seller Cazoo Holdings, in which DMGT has a stake of around 20%, agreed to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company - a so-called Spac - which is expected to provide DMGT with cash and shares worth more than $1bn. The DMGT owns the Metro and i news operations, and also Daily Mail online, one of the most visited news websites in the world. Last year, the Daily Mail eclipsed the Sun as the UK's best-selling daily newspaper. The business traces its roots to 1896, when the Daily Mail was launched by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth. DMGT's shake-up is the latest in a string of deals, including the sale of its education business, Hobsons, energy data operation Genscape and property website Zoopla. Under stock market rules, Lord Rothermere now has until 9 August to make a formal offer or confirm no deal will be made. The Daily Mail has been - arguably - the most influential newspaper in Britain for the past three decades, cowing cabinet ministers and swaying policy with punchy reporting, relentless campaigns and its claim to be the voice of a silent conservative majority. Despite that influence, however, it is a relatively small part of Daily Mail and General Trust, the company that owns it. DMGT has a broad range of media interests, even after the rapid slimming down of recent years that has seen the sale of interests in online estate agencies and the offloading of financial information provider Euromoney. Now that slimming down will accelerate - and if the Rothermere family's bid goes through, the company's shares will be taken off the London Stock Exchange. DMGT has received an offer for one of its largest and most valuable businesses, RMS. It provides specialist information to insurance companies. DMGT's interest in Cazoo, the online car-sales company, will be spun off via a stock market listing in the US. Under the plan outlined this morning, the cash and shares from those two transactions will be handed back to investors, and Lord Rothermere's family company will then buy out all the other shareholders. The big question is why Lord Rothermere wants to do this. It should be possible to return cash to shareholders and keep DMGT as a listed company. Sources close to the DMGT camp this morning said the company had been difficult to value for public company investors and that these transactions would simplify its structure and return cash. That does not answer the question of the listing. Big shareholders normally take companies private when they wish to avoid all the disclosure and governance requirements that come with a stock exchange listing, or have a plan for a big shift in strategy or operations that will be easier to push through once they are the sole shareholder. Expect much speculation about whether Lord Rothermere has such a change in mind for the Daily Mail.

FA review after fans break into Wembley for finalThe FA chief executive Mark Bullingham apologises to legitimate fans whose experience was affected.UK,"This video can not be played Video shows fans breaking through a Wembley Stadium entrance before the final The Football Association (FA) will conduct a full review after a ""large number of drunken yobs"" tried to force their way in to Wembley without tickets ahead of the Euro 2020 final. Fans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham apologised to legitimate fans who were affected and said the security team had ""never seen anything like it"". The Metropolitan Police said it worked with security to prevent breaches. TV audience of 31m watch England lose Euro final PM & FA condemn racist abuse of players Italy spoil England's 'coming home' party Mr Bullingham said he was not sure those who broke in were real fans. ""There were a large number of drunken yobs trying to force their way in, we run a stadium not a fortress,"" he said. ""I have to apologise to any fans whose experience was affected and any of the team who had to cope with this."" He said the FA would work with the police to ban anyone who had forced their way in and to prevent such an event happening again. Downing Street has criticised those who stormed the stadium without tickets. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Those scenes were unacceptable and we condemn violence, anti-social behaviour and abuse in the strongest possible terms."" Lis Nixon, 62, from Oxfordshire, who was at the match, said it was ""horrible"" and ""put you off going"". She said she was pushed and crushed while queuing to get into the stadium and said once inside, there were large numbers of ticketless fans in rows and blocking exits with some people so drunk they had fallen to the ground and were just left there. She said the stewards were ""overwhelmed"" and had ""lost control"" of the situation. Roberta Cuppari (right) with her friend at Wembley Italy supporter Roberta Cuppari said she and her friend had to watch the match crushed in a corner while being sworn at and abused after ticketless fans took their seats and refused to move. ""It was the worst thing I have ever seen,"" said the 38-year-old mother-of-three. ""There were people urinating, people doing drugs."" She said people had pushed through behind them at the entrance, refusing to show their tickets or proof of Covid tests but security had not done anything, even when she had called for help. Ms Cuppari, from Weybridge, Surrey, said it was unsafe and she was glad not to have brought her seven-year-old son, who would have been ""put off football for life"". A Football Association spokesperson initially denied anyone without a ticket had gained entry, saying there were ""no security breaches of people without tickets getting inside the stadium"". In a later statement, a stadium spokesperson said: ""There was a breach of security and a small group of people got into the stadium. ""We are now working closely with stadium stewards and security to remove these people. Anyone inside the stadium without a ticket will be instantly ejected."" Former footballer Dominic Matteo said he had decided not to go into Wembley, despite having a ticket for the match, because of concerns for safety having had health issues in recent years. He said he felt sorry for the stewards who were not equipped to deal with the situation with people ""running in from all different angles just up to no good"". ""It was very scary. I'm 47 years old, I'm a man, I can look after myself, but it felt very intimidating and them people trying to get in, they got in through the disabled entrance, which is scandalous,"" he said. A large crowd had also been trying to enter the fan zone in Trafalgar Square without tickets shortly before kick-off, the Met Police said. Police said they had been ""engaging with the crowd and telling them to disperse"". Some people inside Wembley said there had been fans standing on the concourse for the entire first half, watching the match. After the match, riot police could be seen breaking through crowds outside Wembley Stadium as fans departed. Beer bottles were thrown amid chants against Italy. The Met Police said there had been 45 arrests by officers policing the final, with 19 officers injured ""while they confronted volatile crowds"". Police forces across the country said they had been called to 875 incidents relating to the match - more than double the number during any previous football tournament. There were 246 arrests. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the ""violent minority"" who assaulted officers were not ""true fans"". The FA, prime minister and Duke of Cambridge have alsocondemned the racist abuseaimed at penalty-takers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. The UK Football Policing Unit said it had launched an investigation to identify those posting racist abuse on social media. By Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football reporter The unsavoury scenes at Wembley before and during England's Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy were the result of an uneasy, threatening undercurrent of tension that had been building up throughout the day. Several hours before kick-off, thousands of fans, many fuelled by alcohol, were packed into areas around the stadium in an increasingly frenzied atmosphere that always threatened to get out of hand. Security was ineffective and it is rare at a major final for supporters to be able to get so close to the stadium without tickets. I was offered money for my accreditation lanyard just yards from the media entrance - unthinkable at any such showpiece event I have previously attended. Inevitably, the situation boiled over into the frightening sight of barriers being stormed by scores of ticketless fans desperate to get inside Wembley, with children left terrified, others knocked to the ground, aisles full and the area reserved for disabled spectators swamped with supporters looking for anywhere to sit. Fans who had legitimately paid to watch England's first major final for 55 years were left struggling to watch the game. Stewards, perhaps understandably, were overwhelmed by the numbers they were having to deal with. It certainly did not appear to be a ""small group"" as originally stated. Were you at Wembley?

Racist abuse of England players condemned by PM and FA,"This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate England manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse aimed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss and were targeted on social media after the game. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out.""

England's players have taken a knee before games at the Euros to highlight the fight against racial inequality. On the day the tournament started on 11 June,the prime minister did not condemn fanswho jeered when England players took the knee during two warm-up games. Instead, Johnson said he wanted to see fans ""getting behind the team to cheer them on"" - and was then accused of not having ""the guts to call it out"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. ""We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. This video can not be played Sancho, Jorginho & Saka miss penalties as Italy edge England at Wembley ""Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse."" In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

Early findings bring hope for Long Covid tests,"Scientists say they have detected irregularities in the blood of long Covid patients that could one day pave the way for a test for the condition. Imperial College London researchers found a pattern of rogue antibodies in the blood of a small number of people with long Covid. They hope it could lead to a simple blood test within six to 18 months. Dr Elaine Maxwell, from the National Institute of Health Research, said the early findings were ""exciting"". She said there could be ""a number of different things happening after a Covid-19 infection"" and an autoimmune response ""has been one of the suspected mechanisms"". But she warned that long Covid was a ""complex condition"", saying it was important to continue to research the other causal factors so all different types of post-Covid syndrome could be diagnosed and treated. Long Covid is not yet fully understoodand can cover a range of symptoms lasting long after initial infection including fatigue, breathlessness, headaches and muscle pain. There are currently no tests to diagnose long Covid. Prof Danny Altmann, who is leading the research team at Imperial, said he believes the work will lead to a test which could be done in a doctor's surgery. More than 2m in England may have had long Covid Long Covid: Fears others will suffer when restrictions end Patients call for long Covid clinics in Wales But he said he was concernedthe UK government's plans to ""live with"" Covid-19could be stoking the next wave of cases of the condition. The government plans to end most coronavirus restrictions in England in a week's time, on 19 July. But amid rising cases Prof Altmann warned that it is not yet known if vaccinations will protect people from long-term symptoms. ""If we're heading into a phase of 100,000 cases per day, and, we're saying that 10-20% of all infections can result in long Covid, I can see no certainty that we're not brewing those long Covid cases despite having a vaccinated population,"" he said. In the pilot study, researchers compared the blood of dozens of people and found what are called autoantibodies that were not present in people who recovered quickly, or those who have not had Covid-19. Normally, human immune systems create antibodies to fight disease. But sometimes the body turns on itself - creating the autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. Prof Altmann believes these autoantibodies may be one of the things causing long Covid symptoms. He said it is also possible that some people still have the virus ""persisting"" in their bodies, while others may have other problems with their immune systems. The research is still at an initial stage, meaning the research was done on a small sample size which can be scaled up later. Prof Altmann warned that the findings cannot yet be described as a breakthrough, but said they were ""a very exciting advancement"". An estimated 962,000 people in the UK had long Covid in the four weeks up to 4 June,according to data from the Office for National Statistics,external. And around 385,000 people in the UK are estimated to have been suffering with symptoms for more than a year. Long Covid can affect people of all ages, including children and people who were previously fit and healthy, as well as those who only experienced mild coronavirus symptoms at first. This video can not be played Itâs been more than a year, will I ever recover? - BBC reporter Lucy Adams explored long Covid in a Panorama film I am 44 years old - but in my body, I'm like someone twice my age. I caught Covid in March last year. Having long Covid means I wake up in pain and go to bed with pain. I have vertigo, migraines and blurred vision. After 11 hard months, I began to feel exactly as I had almost a year previously. I went for a test and that evening I got an email saying I had Covid again. Read Lucy's storyhere. In May, the UK government promised to set up 89 long Covid clinics to help patients with specialist care. The guidelines say these clinics should be doctor-led and should accept patients regardless of whether they had needed hospital treatment for Covid-19. However, BBC Panorama found some clinics are not staffed by doctors - and four of them only see patients who were originally hospitalised with Covid. Ten clinics had patients who had been waiting more than 100 days and the longest wait was more than six months, at 191 days. In response, NHS England said it has ""invested more than Â£134 million"" in long Covid services and is setting up 15 paediatric hubs. Neither Scotland nor Wales have specialised clinics. Both told the BBC they were strengthening existing services. Scotland said it was investing in Â£2.5m in research. Northern Ireland's first long Covid clinics will open in October. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: ""The government rapidly provided specialist care for acutely ill Covid-19 patients at the start of the pandemic and we've matched that speed and scale in our support for people with long Covid."" They said they had backed scientists with over Â£50m for research to better understand the long-term effects.

FA condemns racist abuse of England players,"This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate England manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse aimed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss and were targeted on social media after the game. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out."" England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together.
