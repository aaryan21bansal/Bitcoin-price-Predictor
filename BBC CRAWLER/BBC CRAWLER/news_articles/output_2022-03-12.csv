UK and Irish prime ministers discuss NI Protocol,"MicheÃ¡l Martin and Boris Johnson sat together at the Ireland-England Six Nations match The international co-operation shown in response to Ukraine suggests it should be possible to resolve a matter like the Northern Ireland Protocol, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. MicheÃ¡l Martin was speaking a day after meeting UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London, during which they discussed both the Ukraine war and the protocol. They met before attendingthe England-Ireland rugby match on Saturday. Mr Martin has a series of engagements in London ahead of St Patrick's Day. Speaking a day after his meeting with Mr Johnson, the taoiseach told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that some progress has already been made in the post-Brexit trade dispute between the EU and the UK. However, he said he did not believe there would be a breakthrough before the Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May. Asked if the protocol talks had now been ""kicked into the long grass"" because of the crisis in Ukraine, Mr Martin said: ""I think we should concentrate, obviously, on our response to Ukraine."" However, he added he also believed the crisis showed it should also be possible to make further progress on problems like the post-Brexit trade dispute. ""What's interesting - and I welcome this warmly - is the very strong partnership between between the UK, the EU, the US on fundamental issues of substance - which is democracy; human rights; the freedom of the individual - and that is something that I think really trumps the issues. ""It really says to us all that we should be able to resolve issues to do with the Northern Ireland Protocol."" During Saturday's meeting, Mr Martin and Mr Johnson also discussed ways of working together to ensure the return of the Northern Ireland Executive following May's assembly election. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it would be difficult for his party to form a governmentif issues around the protocol are not addressed. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The mechanism to ensure free trade across the Irish border post-Brexit has been criticised by some unionists for its knock-on impact to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In February, the DUP'sPaul Givan resigned as first ministeras part of the party's protest against the protocol, causing the collapse of the executive. Taoiseach Micheal Martin wore a scarf with the colours of the Ukrainian flag as he led Sunday's St Patrick's Day parade in London The taoiseach welcomed the ongoing engagement between the UK and the European Union on the protocol issue. Mr Martin said access to the EU single market was important to Northern Ireland for inward investment but he added both sides were trying to find solutions. He argued that the EU had ""put forward a lot of sensible compromises and their mindset is to really resolve this, and I believe the foreign secretary (Liz Truss) is in the same mode of thought"".

Body of missing hillwalker found in Glen Coe,"Mountain rescue teams and a helicopter had been searching for Neil Gillingham and his dog Police have confirmed that a body recovered on Stob Coire Sgreamhach in Glen Coe is that of missing hillwalker Neil Gillingham. The 43-year-old and his springer spaniel had been missing since Sunday 6 March. The pair were last seen at about 13:30 near Stob Coire Nam Beith, a summit on the mountain Bidean Nam Bian. Mr Gillingham had planned to walk to both locations with his dog before descending to the Lost Valley. Searches covered Glencoe, Lochaber and Oban and involved RAF and police mountain rescue teams and a coastguard helicopter. On Saturday, Police Scotland confirmed the hillwalker's family had been made aware of the find and were being supported by officers. The death is not being treated as suspicious and, as with all sudden deaths, a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Sgt Keith Almond said: ""Our thoughts are with Neil's family at what is a very difficult time for them. ""Officers would like to pass on their thanks to the mountain rescue teams, HM Coastguard helicopter crews and members of the public who assisted with the searches. ""We would also like to thank all those who shared and responded to our appeal."" Police also confirmed that the dog was found safe and well on Monday.

"Energy bills hike to wipe out pay rises, warns TUC","Energy bills are due to rise at least 14 times faster than wages this year, new research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests. The TUC said average weekly wages are due to rise by 3.75% - while the price cap for gas and electricity set by Ofgem will go up by 54% in April. That means energy price rises alone could wipe out or exceed pay rises. The government says it is offering Â£21bn of help with bills - but rejected halting a rise in National Insurance. The tax increase of 1.25p in the pound comes into force in April, just as the rising price of energy - likely to be made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - is leading to large increases in the cost of living. According to the Resolution Foundation think tank, thetypical household income will fall by about Â£1,000this year in real terms - the largest fall in living standards since the mid-1970s. The TUC said people on low incomes will be hit hardest by the record energy prices, as years of low wage growth and benefits cuts have left poorer families ""badly exposed"" to increases in the cost of living. What help with bills is there in my council tax band? The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Since 2010, energy bills have risen at twice the rate of average wages, the TUC estimated. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said households are being ""pushed to the brink"" and called on the government to impose a windfall tax on oil and gas profits to provide more support. Rising oil and gas prices are also pushing other costs higher, with average petrol prices hittinga new record high of Â£1.60 a litre. Earlier this month,the highest rail fare increases for nine yearscame into effect, pushing up prices by 3.8%. Inflation - which takes into account the changing prices of goods and services across the UK economy - reacheda 30-year high of 5.5% last month, with the Bank of England warning it could rise above 7% this year. Food pricesin particular are expected to surge further as a result of the war, as Russia and Ukraine normally supply 30% of the world's wheat. Labour has called for the government to halt its planned National Insurance rise, which is set to cost an extra Â£214 a year for someone earning Â£30,000. But Downing Street has said it is fully committed to the increase, which is intended to help tackle the NHS backlog from Covid and fund social care. A government spokesperson said its Â£21bn support package for energy costs included a Â£150 council tax rebate in April for most households and a Â£200 energy bill discount in October - which will have to be repaid over five years. The government also said it plans to set out an energy supply strategy to ""supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity"" and ""drive down energy costs"".

Drakeford attacks UK ministers' Ukraine responseWales' first minister strongly criticises UK government's handling of Ukrainian refugee crisis.,"Mark Drakeford said there must be ""no more prevarication"" on Ukrainian refugees Wales' first minister has strongly criticised the UK government's handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Mark Drakeford said the gap between what ministers say and the actions they delivered was ""shamefully wide"". The UK government is expected to introduce anew visa scheme on Monday. However, addressing the Welsh Labour conference, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers had shown ""a real dereliction of the moral and practical duty"" to Ukrainians. It is understood that under anew visa schemeindividuals and organisations may be allowed to sponsor Ukrainians to come to the UK if they do not have family connections. LIVE: Ukraine accuses Russia of Preventing evacuation In pictures: War, suffering and defiance in Ukraine Labour should be inspired by Wales, Drakeford says Labour and Plaid Cymru approve Senedd deal Speaking at the conference in Llandudno on Saturday, Mr Drakeford told party members that he had had several discussions with UK ministers over the last two weeks to discuss what help Wales can give to Ukrainian refugees. He said the Welsh government was ready to help refugees as soon as they arrive in the UK and that UK ministers say ""they share the same intentions"". However Mr Drakeford said: ""If, as the prime minister says, he stands shoulder to shoulder with people in Ukraine, that must seem a very long way off to all those who are dealing with what charities on the ground are calling a 'chaotic, heartless and unkind' response when trying to access the prime minister's good will. ""The gap between what the Conservative government says and the actions it delivers is shamefully wide. ""Shameful to the UK's reputation around the world, shamefully at odds with the instinctive generosity of so many people across our country. ""And, most shamefully of all, a real dereliction of the moral and practical duty we have to do everything we can to help those innocent people whose lives have been destroyed by Russian action. ""Let the message from this conference be clear - no more prevarication and no more claiming to lead the world, while being the world's leading foot-dragger."" Woman speaks of 'horror' as Russia attacks Refugees in Wales urge help for people fleeing war The prime minister has told Sky News the UK would be ""generous"" to those fleeing Ukraine, and that details of a second visa scheme would be announced on Monday. Defending the current visa rules, Mr Johnson said: ""People want us to be generous but also careful."" The UK has been criticised for only taking in about 1,000 refugees so far. Sir Keir Starmer: ""Labour stands with the Ukrainian people"" Speaking earlier at the conference on Ukraine, UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was time to ""tackle the oligarchs here by going after their stolen wealth and assets"". ""And while we're at it clean up our own politics, once and for all,"" he said. He added: ""There is no justification for Putin's actions. They are an affront to the values of this country, this party and the international institutions, which we helped to build. ""Labour stands with the Ukrainian people."" Sir Keir said he had just returned from Estonia where he had the opportunity to thank Nato forces, which included the Royal Tank Regiment and the Royal Welsh, for their work. Mr Drakeford has previously welcomed theUK government relaxing visa rules, but agreed with Sir Keir thatmore needs to be done to help refugees. Sir Keir Starmer arrived at the conference with shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens (left) and deputy Welsh Labour leader Carolyn Harris In an interview, Sir Keir stopped short of supporting Mr Drakeford's call for visa requirements to be dropped for Ukranian refugees but said the pair were ""coming from exactly the same place"" on the issue. He said ""a simple, safe, quick and efficient route to sanctuary"" was needed and the current system was ""too narrow, too slow, with too many hurdles in place"". Asked whether he was supporting Mr Drakeford's call for Ukrainian refugees to be allowed into the UK without visas, Sir Keir said they both wanted ""a simple safe route to sanctuary"". Welsh minister Mick Antoniw spoke on an emergency motion expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Mr Antoniw, the Welsh government's Counsel General, or most senior legal adviser, comes from a Ukrainian family. He said: ""Seventy-five years after the end of the Second World War, we are now witnessing in Europe the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity on a scale previously unimaginable. ""We're witnessing the emergence of a new fascism, a fascism with a difference, a fascism that has global links, a level of military technology greater than anything previously experienced and nuclear weapons."" On refugees, he urged UK ministers ""to remove the shackles on the immigration system that they have actually created"" to allow Wales to ""show the world what it means to be a nation of sanctuary"". Mick Antoniw (right) has said he felt guilt at leaving Ukraine on the eve of the invasion Mr Antoniw, whovisited Ukraine just days before the Russian invasion, concluded his words with what he said was now the traditional way of ending a Ukrainian speech. ""Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes - we will win,"" he said, to applause and a standing ovation. Later, he told BBC Wales that people in the UK willing to sponsor Ukrainian refugees should be allowed to apply for visas on their behalf. ""You cannot expect people in a war zone facing missiles and roadblocks, who don't even know if they will have the internet tomorrow, to access online to be able to go through these processes,"" he said. Plans to expand the Welsh Parliament were backed by the conference In the first conference debate of the weekend, Welsh Labour backed proposals to increase the size of the Senedd. The conference unanimously voted for a motion saying the 60-member parliament should grow to between 80 and 100 members. But it leaves open the question of how Senedd members (MSs) will be elected. Parties in the Senedd are negotiating on a plan to reform the institution and swell its size. Labour will hold a one-off conference to decide whether it will endorse the outcome of those negotiations. Under the law, any reforms would need to be approved by two-thirds of MSs, making Labour's position crucial. Labour said the way MSs are elected should be ""at least as proportional"" as the current system. While it did not rule it out, it warned there were ""risks"" to adopting thesingle transferable voting,externalsystem that some parties want.

"In pictures: War, suffering and defiance in UkraineImages from Russia's invasion of Ukraine show a conflict turning deadlier nearly three weeks on.Europe","It's already week three of the Russian invasion - and the scenes below are becoming all too familiar across Ukraine. Cities across the country often wake up to the haunting call of air raid sirens and skies filled with traces of rockets, missiles and artillery strikes, like this one from Baryshivka, east of the capital, Kyiv. Russia may have been slow to advance inside Ukrainian territory, but the shelling has been intense. The Russians say they are hitting military targets - the scene below is from a storage facility in Kalynivka, in the centre of the country. Ukrainians, however, say the occupying force has been aiming for civilian targets indiscriminately. One of the worst-hit cities has been Kharkiv in the east. The BBC'sQuentin Sommerville says entering the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5 million population has fled. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies, our correspondent says. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running - these volunteers below are preparing food for the defenders, and others who may need it. And the toll is mounting by the day. Even though official figures are patchy, thousands are believed to have lost their lives or sustained serious injuries, many losing limbs in the shelling. The situation is said to be dire in the port city of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Russian troops for nearly two weeks. Authorities say nearly 1,600 have died as a result of Russian shelling alone - and they are unable to collect the bodies amid unrelenting Russian firepower to force it to surrender. Not far from Mariupol, another battle is being waged to conquer the city of Mykolaiv. Cluster bombs have been used, but the locals are resisting. However, Mykolaiv's governor Vitaly Kim is loath to celebrate prematurely,telling the BBC's Andrew Harding, ""We are winning this fight, but not this war."" Dnipro was hit for the first time on Friday - a day when Russia expanded its strikes from east, where the city lies, to the west. The capital city is bracing for the worst. Ukrainian forces have been holding the Russians back for days on the outskirts. And in Kyiv city itself, volunteers have been preparing - digging trenches and building barricades.The city is turning into a fortress, says our correspondent there Jeremy Bowen. Others are trying to contribute to the effort. Field kitchens have sprung up in various neighbourhoods. However, for many Ukrainians - women and children only, as men have to stay behind to fight - the scramble to flee has become the norm. More than 2.5 million people have now left the country. The shock is all too real. Here in Moldova, Smadar the Clown tries to lighten the mood with this mock interview with a young Ukrainian girl at a refugee centre in the country's capital, Chisinau. Moldova clown Culture is randomly a victim of the war, too, as seen in too many conflicts this century alone. The picturesque western city of Lviv has been left untouched, so far. But it is preparing - the checkpoints on main roads and the soldiers on the streets can be seen by all - butsome preparations are taking place behind closed doors, says the BBC's Joel Gunter. In Lviv's galleries, museums and churches, a huge operation is under way to safeguard the city's cultural heritage, he says.

Fears funeral reforms could mean thousands lose money,"Lyn Burrow is worried she might lose some, or all, of their money ""It has given me sleepless nights, I've been up at 3 o'clock in the morning wondering what the outcome will be."" 72-year-old Lyn Burrow is talking about the thousands of pounds she's paid to cover the cost of her funeral when she dies. She and her husband Fred, 80, spent a total of Â£6,310 with funeral plan provider Safe Hands. Now they're worried they might lose some, or even all, of their money. The funeral plan market is being reformed and industry insiders are worried that this could mean some providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. ""The way things sounded we stood the chance of losing all the money we had paid for these plans, so we decided we would cancel the plans and would just have to swallow the Â£800 cancellation fees,"" says Lyn. ""We felt if we at least got some money back it would be better than nothing"". Safe Hands, which has withdrawn its application for approval by the UK's financial regulator, meaning it will not be allowed to operate after 29 July, told Lyn it hoped to find another funeral provider to take over its client book. It also said Lyn would have to wait a month for her refund, leaving her worried she may not see any money at all. Safe Hands did not reply to the BBC's numerous requests for comment. People like Lyn and Fred are worried because the UK's funeral plan sector is being reformed by the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). From 29 July, any provider must be authorised andregulated by the FCA,externalwhich, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment. The FCA says reform is needed because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices like high pressure sales tactics and cold calls, and it wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do. The very real problem for people like Lyn and Fred though is that whilst the regulation of funeral plan companies will be a good thing in future, getting to that point could mean some people lose out. ""There are around 65 firms that operate in this sector and not all of them will be able to demonstrate they can meet the standards that will ensure protection for consumers in the future"" according to industry expert Kate Robinson from Avyse Partners, which specialises in regulatory consultancy. ""The point is - firms which don't go for authorisation will either choose not to be regulated or won't be able to meet the new standards because they present such a significant step change to what was in place previously. ""This means some providers may not be able to deliver the funerals they have sold because they have to either transfer the business to another firm or it may force firms into administration and if that happens customers will likely lose out."" 1.6 million customers 200,000 funeral plans taken out every year Approximately 65 companies Average plan costs Â£4,000 Average plan lasts for 8 years Source: FCA/Fairer Finance Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July. The Funeral Planning Authority told Money Box it has been concerned about this situation for a number of years. ""We made our concerns known to both HM Treasury and the FCA,"" it said. ""Customers who took out plans in good faith are potentially being punished as a consequence of a Government policy, the approach taken to the implementation of that policy, and the lack of a properly thought through transition process that was designed to protect customers."" The government said: ""Bringing pre-paid funeral plans into regulation will protect consumers from bad practice within the sector including by exposing any unsustainable business models and preventing problems from getting worse, and impacting more consumers. ""This follows extensive consultation and the Financial Conduct Authority is now taking proportionate steps to regulate these pre-paid plans. ""The FCA's guidance is clear that firms not seeking authorisation should transfer their existing books of business or wind down in an orderly way before regulation starts."" James Daley, the managing director and co-founder of consumer group Fairer Finance, has this advice for people worried about their funeral plans: ""If you're in the cooling off period [having very recently bought a plan] and you can cancel free of charge and you're with a smaller company you're worried about, then cancel because there's no cost. ""But if you're going to incur a cancellation fee, and some of these policies charge up to Â£1,300 in cancellation fees, my advice would be to sit tight for now. ""Rather than crystalising a loss it may be better to hold your nerve for a few weeks or a few months and see what this settlement ends up being.""

UK Labour plans to match Welsh government example,"Mark Drakeford said there must be ""no more prevarication"" on Ukrainian refugees Wales' first minister has strongly criticised the UK government's handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Mark Drakeford said the gap between what ministers say and the actions they delivered was ""shamefully wide"". The UK government is expected to introduce anew visa scheme on Monday. However, addressing the Welsh Labour conference, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers had shown ""a real dereliction of the moral and practical duty"" to Ukrainians. It is understood that under anew visa schemeindividuals and organisations may be allowed to sponsor Ukrainians to come to the UK if they do not have family connections. LIVE: Ukraine accuses Russia of Preventing evacuation In pictures: War, suffering and defiance in Ukraine Labour should be inspired by Wales, Drakeford says Labour and Plaid Cymru approve Senedd deal Speaking at the conference in Llandudno on Saturday, Mr Drakeford told party members that he had had several discussions with UK ministers over the last two weeks to discuss what help Wales can give to Ukrainian refugees. He said the Welsh government was ready to help refugees as soon as they arrive in the UK and that UK ministers say ""they share the same intentions"". However Mr Drakeford said: ""If, as the prime minister says, he stands shoulder to shoulder with people in Ukraine, that must seem a very long way off to all those who are dealing with what charities on the ground are calling a 'chaotic, heartless and unkind' response when trying to access the prime minister's good will. ""The gap between what the Conservative government says and the actions it delivers is shamefully wide. ""Shameful to the UK's reputation around the world, shamefully at odds with the instinctive generosity of so many people across our country. ""And, most shamefully of all, a real dereliction of the moral and practical duty we have to do everything we can to help those innocent people whose lives have been destroyed by Russian action. ""Let the message from this conference be clear - no more prevarication and no more claiming to lead the world, while being the world's leading foot-dragger."" Woman speaks of 'horror' as Russia attacks Refugees in Wales urge help for people fleeing war The prime minister has told Sky News the UK would be ""generous"" to those fleeing Ukraine, and that details of a second visa scheme would be announced on Monday. Defending the current visa rules, Mr Johnson said: ""People want us to be generous but also careful."" The UK has been criticised for only taking in about 1,000 refugees so far. Sir Keir Starmer: ""Labour stands with the Ukrainian people"" Speaking earlier at the conference on Ukraine, UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was time to ""tackle the oligarchs here by going after their stolen wealth and assets"". ""And while we're at it clean up our own politics, once and for all,"" he said. He added: ""There is no justification for Putin's actions. They are an affront to the values of this country, this party and the international institutions, which we helped to build. ""Labour stands with the Ukrainian people."" Sir Keir said he had just returned from Estonia where he had the opportunity to thank Nato forces, which included the Royal Tank Regiment and the Royal Welsh, for their work. Mr Drakeford has previously welcomed theUK government relaxing visa rules, but agreed with Sir Keir thatmore needs to be done to help refugees. Sir Keir Starmer arrived at the conference with shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens (left) and deputy Welsh Labour leader Carolyn Harris In an interview, Sir Keir stopped short of supporting Mr Drakeford's call for visa requirements to be dropped for Ukranian refugees but said the pair were ""coming from exactly the same place"" on the issue. He said ""a simple, safe, quick and efficient route to sanctuary"" was needed and the current system was ""too narrow, too slow, with too many hurdles in place"". Asked whether he was supporting Mr Drakeford's call for Ukrainian refugees to be allowed into the UK without visas, Sir Keir said they both wanted ""a simple safe route to sanctuary"". Welsh minister Mick Antoniw spoke on an emergency motion expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Mr Antoniw, the Welsh government's Counsel General, or most senior legal adviser, comes from a Ukrainian family. He said: ""Seventy-five years after the end of the Second World War, we are now witnessing in Europe the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity on a scale previously unimaginable. ""We're witnessing the emergence of a new fascism, a fascism with a difference, a fascism that has global links, a level of military technology greater than anything previously experienced and nuclear weapons."" On refugees, he urged UK ministers ""to remove the shackles on the immigration system that they have actually created"" to allow Wales to ""show the world what it means to be a nation of sanctuary"". Mick Antoniw (right) has said he felt guilt at leaving Ukraine on the eve of the invasion Mr Antoniw, whovisited Ukraine just days before the Russian invasion, concluded his words with what he said was now the traditional way of ending a Ukrainian speech. ""Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes - we will win,"" he said, to applause and a standing ovation. Later, he told BBC Wales that people in the UK willing to sponsor Ukrainian refugees should be allowed to apply for visas on their behalf. ""You cannot expect people in a war zone facing missiles and roadblocks, who don't even know if they will have the internet tomorrow, to access online to be able to go through these processes,"" he said. Plans to expand the Welsh Parliament were backed by the conference In the first conference debate of the weekend, Welsh Labour backed proposals to increase the size of the Senedd. The conference unanimously voted for a motion saying the 60-member parliament should grow to between 80 and 100 members. But it leaves open the question of how Senedd members (MSs) will be elected. Parties in the Senedd are negotiating on a plan to reform the institution and swell its size. Labour will hold a one-off conference to decide whether it will endorse the outcome of those negotiations. Under the law, any reforms would need to be approved by two-thirds of MSs, making Labour's position crucial. Labour said the way MSs are elected should be ""at least as proportional"" as the current system. While it did not rule it out, it warned there were ""risks"" to adopting thesingle transferable voting,externalsystem that some parties want.

Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine?,"Britain has reacted with concern at unconfirmed reports of an alleged chemical attack in the besieged city of Mariupol. The alarm was raised by some of the last Ukrainian soldiers still holding out against the Russian assault there. They are from the Azov Battalion, a small but controversial element of Ukraine's National Guard due to their far right tendencies. They claim that after a Russian drone flew over, there was a cloud of smoke and three of their members experienced breathing difficulties. These could be symptoms consistent with a chemical or poison gas attack but this will be hard to prove. Reported chemical attack deeply concerning The global watchdog for chemical weapons - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - would usually be called in to assess any evidence. But that will be challenging in Mariupol, for obvious reasons. The former British Army officer Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert, cautioned that even if uncontaminated samples could be collected from the scene they would need to be taken to another country for analysis. This, he said, would take some time. Western governments are also able to examine satellite imagery and other intelligence for any signs that chemical weapons units or vehicles were nearby, he said. But that won't give any hard and fast answers any time soon. Britain's Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the incident needed proper investigation. He said that if Russia were found to have used banned chemical weapons then ""nothing was ruled out"" in terms of Nato's response. So what does that mean exactly? Ministers won't be drawn on the details. Even if it could be proved to be a chemical attack, Nato would still be extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the fighting inside Ukraine's borders. At most it would probably lead to yet more sanctions on Russia and a further stepping up of military hardware exports to Ukraine. Chemical weapons are any kind of munitions that carry toxins or chemical substances that attack the body's system. There are different categories of chemical weapons. Choking agents like phosgene attack the lungs and respiratory system, causing victims to drown in their lungs' secretions. There are blister agents, like mustard gas, which burn the skin and blind people. Then there is the most lethal category of all: nerve agents, which interfere with the brain's messages to the body's muscles. A tiny drop of these can be fatal. Less than 0.5mg of VX nerve agent, for example, is enough to kill an adult. Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme All of these so-called chemical agents can be used in warfare in artillery shells, bombs and missiles. However, all are strictly prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 which was signed by the vast majority of nations, including Russia. Chemical weapons were used in World War One, in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and more recently by the Syrian government against rebel forces. Russia says it destroyed the last of its chemical weapons stocks in 2017, but since then there have been at least two chemical attacks blamed on Moscow. The first was the Salisbury attack of March 2018. A former KGB officer and defector, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned along with his daughter by the nerve agent Novichok. Russia denied responsibility and came up with over 20 different explanations for who else could have done it. However, investigators concluded it was the work of two officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence. To show their disgust, countries around the world expelled a total of 128 Russian spies and diplomats. Then, in August 2020, the prominent Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was also poisoned with Novichok and narrowly escaped death. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was almost killed with by a chemical weapons attack Some military analysts fear that if the coming Russian assault in the Donbas fails to achieve its objectives then, in desperation, President Putin could authorise the use of chemical weapons on stubborn defenders. If Russia were to use weapons like poison gas in this war, it would be seen as crossing a major red line, most probably prompting calls for the West to take action. Chemical weapons played a decisive role in the Syrian government's campaign to suppress resistance in rebel-held cities, killing and incapacitating fighters and civilians alike. The Syrian air force, which reportedly carried out dozens of these attacks, was supported and protected by the Russian air force. The general in charge of Russia's war effort there, Aleksandr Dvornikov, has now been appointed to run Moscow's war against Ukraine. The unpleasant truth about chemical weapons is that if you have a protracted war, where the attacking military are trying to break the will of defending forces, then these weapons are one hideously effective way to achieve that. They not only permeate into cellars and bunkers, they can result in an agonising death and hence are also a psychological weapon of terror.

Spam website set up to reach millions of Russians,"Fabian at work on his spamming website A Norwegian computer expert has created a website enabling anyone to send an email about the war in Ukraine to up to 150 Russian email addresses at a time, so that Russian people have a chance to hear the truth their government is hiding. All over Russia email inboxes are pinging. Millions of messages are being received with the same intriguing subjectYa vam ne vrag- I am not your enemy. The message appears in Russian with an English translation and it begins: ""Dear friend, I am writing to you to express my concern for the secure future of our children on this planet. Most of the world has condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine."" The lengthy email goes on to implore Russian people to reject the war in Ukraine and seek the truth about the invasion from non-state news services. In just a few days, more than 22 million of these emails landed in Russian inboxes, and they're being sent by volunteers around the world, who are donating their time and email addresses to the cause. It's one of a growing number of unusual ways that hackers, activists and every day people around the world are trying to reach out to Russian people online to circumvent media blocks and censorship. One Polish Twitter user'sidea to post reviews,externaltalking about the war to Russian businesses on Google and Yandex went viral. Elsewhere hacker groups claim to have defaced Russian news websites with messages to Russian people to ""stop Putin"". But the spam email campaign created by a small team in Norway seems to have caught the imagination of thousands of people searching for ways to help Russians learn about the war. A US transport aircraft dropping leaflets on Korea, during the 1950-1953 Korean War ""During the Second World War, and in earlier wars, people flew over Germany with leaflets and dropped them out. This is just a more modern way of trying to get people to open their eyes,"" says Fabian, who came up with the idea. The 50-year-old Norwegian, who runs a computer network business, doesn't want his surname to be published for fear of retaliation from the Russian authorities. He says he felt compelled to do something after becoming increasingly anxious about the possibility of World War Three. His website, which the BBC is not naming, is circumventing Russian censorship through a mix of clever computing and people power. The system allows people to send his templated message to dozens of Russian email addresses at once, and he estimates that tens of thousands of volunteers have done this since the website went live. Fabian built it with five colleagues, who worked flat-out last weekend to get the job done. They started by trawling the internet for known Russian email addresses and compiled a list of 90 million accounts they believe are active. He says the strength of the system lies in getting volunteers to use their own email accounts instead of bulk-messaging the email addresses using spam software. Users can choose to contact from one to 150 Russian people. Then, with a click, the volunteer's default email client (Outlook or Gmail, for example) is loaded up with the unique email addresses, subject and body text ready to send. People are also able to personalise the contents too, to increase the chances of getting their email read. Some foreign news websites are still accessible from Russia, but the BBC is blocked There are two reasons, says Fabian, for using people's personal email accounts: the emails get through email spam filters if they are sent from real accounts, and in small numbers. ""But also, people can actually receive replies from Russians and engage with them and have conversations about the war."" Fabian says some accounts will be less active than others and in some cases the email may end up in the junk mail folder. But many of the messages are being read, he says, and some Russians are replying. Alex, also in Norway, was asked to test the system by Fabian's team, but has kept sending emails since. ""I've sent around 500 emails so far and got around 20 replies within a day, so I'm hoping for more,"" he says. ""Most of the replies are people asking me to take them off my mailing list but I got talking to a 35-year-old woman from St Petersburg. She told me she wasn't sure what was going on in the conflict and wanted to know more. She said there was a lack of news coming out of Europe and she wanted to read about it all but didn't know how to get through the blocks on websites."" Alex then explained how she could sidestep Russia's internet blocks ""I think I've got a friend in her now!"" he says. Another 18-year-old volunteer shared the reply she received from an unknown Russian. The message argued strongly that she was wrong and it was Ukraine that was killing innocent people which is why ""this special operation is a necessary measure"". Fabian says his team are constantly tweaking the text and subject of their email template to evade email spam filters, and hope many of the 90 million email addresses will eventually receive the message. If they run out of emails to try he says the team will find more. They have also had to fend off attacks from unknown hackers trying to bring the site down. Fabian argues that what he is doing is ""not propaganda"". Asked how he feels about spamming millions of people, he replies that the intrusion is justified because the stakes are so high. Is he putting unsuspecting recipients in danger? ""You can't charge the recipient of the email. They're served our email without being able to consent to it, so it's kind of involuntarily receiving a leaflet. It's literally a war. You have to stand up for what you believe in. And I believe in this."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground WATCH:On the front line with Ukrainian soldiers IMAGES:Scale of destruction in Mariupol revealed WAR CRIMES:Could Putin be prosecuted?

Abramovich disqualified as Chelsea director,"Roman Abramovich has owned Premier League club Chelsea since 2003 The Premier League has disqualified Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as a director of the club after the oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government. Also on Saturday, sleeve sponsor Hyundai became the latest company to suspend its deal with the club. Abramovich had his British assets - including Chelsea - frozen on Thursday as part of the government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move put the Russian's prospectivesale of the clubon hold. The Premier League said Abramovich's disqualification would ""not impact on the club's ability to train and play"". Removing an owner from a board would usually trigger the sale of the shares, a process that Abramovich had instigated on 2 March after the threat of sanctions was raised in Parliament. He had instructed American investment firm Raine Group to seek Â£3bn for the club, but finance experts believe that price could drop given the current uncertainty around Chelsea. Chelsea credit card facilities suspended Q&A: What do UK government sanctions on Abramovich mean for Chelsea? The Sports Desk: Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football? Chelsea face uncertain future - Tuchel Raine Group temporarily halted the sale process on Thursday while answers were sought from the government about the implications of the sanctions. The government is open to considering an addition to the special licence it granted the club that would allow a sale to go ahead. A condition for that to happen, however, would be that Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people and believed to be close to the country's president, Vladimir Putin - receives none of the proceeds. The special licence granted by the government will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket-holders to attend matches. Chelsea, however, cannot receive money for match tickets which have not already been sold, future gate receipts for FA Cup games or money from merchandise sold via the club shop. The European champions will also be unable to buy or sell players, or offer new contracts, while the sanctions are in place on Abramovich and he still owns the club. An amendment to the licence has been granted by the government, allowing Chelsea to spend up to Â£900,000 on costs for home games, up from the Â£500,000 set on Thursday. The allowable away costs of travel, however, remain at Â£20,000 per game. The licence update also allows the club to receive prize money from existing competitions including Premier League payments and Champions League money for getting through each round. A statement from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) confirming the changes to the licence also welcomed the league's move to disqualify Abramovich as a club director. ""The government has made clear that we need to hold to account those who have enabled the Putin regime,"" the DCMS statement said. South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai is the second sponsor to suspend its deal, after Chelsea's main shirt sponsor Three suspended its Â£40m-a-year deal on Thursday. Hyundai signed a multi-year partnership with the Blues in 2018 Like Three, Hyundai has asked for its logo to be removed from the team's shirts ""as soon as feasibly possible"". ""Hyundai has become one of the strongest partners in football over the years and the company supports the sport to be a force for good,"" the company said. ""Through our partnership with Chelsea, we are proud supporters of the players, the fans and grassroots football. However, in the current circumstances, we have taken the decision to suspend our marketing and communication activities with the club until further notice."" Hyundai have been Chelsea's sleeve sponsor since 2018 Simon Stone, BBC Sport football reporter The unravelling of Roman Abramovich's time as Chelsea owner is happening at rapid pace. It is only 28 days since Abramovich celebrated on the pitch with manager Thomas Tuchel as Chelsea became world club champions. Now, the club is up for sale and Abramovich is becoming a non-person within the Premier League. He wasn't involved in the sale of the club even before this latest development but it does underline the need for a deal to be done pretty quickly. The name of the man who changed Chelsea's fortunes may still be revered by some of the club's supporters but it is clear his association with Vladimir Putin is creating serious issues at Stamford Bridge.

Baby born at 23 weeks finally able to go home,"Lucas wore a graduation gown to celebrate the day he was finally able to leave hospital A baby boy born at 23 weeks with a 15% chance of survival has been able to go home for the first time. Lucas weighed just 1lb 3oz (539g) when he arrived into the world on 16 October at Liverpool Women's Hospital. He spent almost five months on a ward after struggling with complications including sepsis and collapsed lungs. His mother Sarah Chialton described him as her ""little miracle"" and thanked medical staff at the hospital for ""saving his life"". ""I can't even describe my emotions,"" said the 30-year-old, about the moment she first stepped foot through the front door with her little boy. ""It was amazing. It was unbelievable."" The first-time mother, from Litherland in Merseyside, described her pregnancy as ""normal"" until she noticed an unusual discharge when she was 23 weeks and one day. She was advised to go to the hospital for a check-up and was informed she was 2cm dilated, despite not feeling any pains or contractions. Lucas was described as a ""fighter"" after being born prematurely ""It was unlikely to be a good outcome for a baby born at 23 weeks,"" Ms Chialton, a nurse, said. ""They were saying at the start there's a 15% chance of survival. ""I can't really remember much about it. I just remember feeling quite overwhelmed."" Lucas was born at 23 weeks and four days, appearing little more than the size of a ""Biro pen"", his mother said. ""I just remember one of the doctors saying ""he's breathing, he's breathing"" so they rushed him over to the side,"" she continued. ""He was a very poorly baby at the start and I remember the doctors saying 'just prepare yourself'."" Lucas spent 142 days in hospital after suffering six different infections, two collapsed lungs as well as needing several blood transfusions. But on Sunday, Sarah was able to bring her little boy, who now weighs 8lb 4oz (3.7kg), home for the first time. Sarah said her son was doing well but will need oxygen for the first year of his life ""The neo-natal unit was just unbelievable. From day one the support that I got from the nurses was amazing,"" Ms Chialton said. ""They saved my little boy's life. I can't thank them enough."" She added she wanted to share her story to hopefully give some comfort to other parents going through similar experiences, urging them to ""hold onto hope"". ""Hope is all I had from the start and it worked,"" she said. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

How mercenaries for Ukraine are being recruited in Russia,"Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign. The serving mercenary said many veterans of the secretive Wagner organisation were contacted on a private Telegram group a few weeks before the start of the war. They were invited to a ""picnic in Ukraine"", with references to tasting ""Salo"", a pork fat traditionally eaten in Ukraine. The message appeals to ""those with criminal records, debts, banned from mercenary groups or without an external passport"" to apply. The message also included that ""those from the Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk republics and Crimea - cordially invited"". Wagner in eastern Ukraine, 2014/15 The Wagner group is one of the most secretive organisations in Russia. Officially, it doesn't exist - serving as a mercenary is against Russian and international law. But up to 10,000 operatives are believed to have taken at least one contract with Wagner over the past seven years. The serving mercenary who spoke to the BBC said new recruits are being placed in units under the command of officers from the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit of the ministry of defence. He stressed that the recruitment policy had changed, and fewer restrictions were applied. ""They are recruiting anyone and everyone,"" he said, unhappy with what he described as the lower professionalism of the new fighters. He said the new units being recruited are no longer referred to as Wagner, but new names - such as The Hawks - were being used. Read more about Wagner In 2021,the BBC gained access to an electronic tabletleft behind by a Wagner fighter in Libya This seems to be part of a recent tendency to steer away from the Wagner group's reputation, as ""the brand is tainted"", says Candace Rondeaux, professor of Russian, Eurasian and Eastern European studies at Arizona State University. Wagner has faced repeated accusations of human rights abuses and war crimes in its operations in Syria and Libya. The mercenary sources who spoke to the BBC, said the recruits are trained at the Wagner base in Mol'kino in southern Russia, next to a Russian army base. As well as the private messaging groups, there has also been a public campaign in Russia to recruit mercenaries. On the Russian social media platform VK, a page that describes itself as a specialist in security activities, posted an advert during the first week of the invasion calling for ""security guards"" from other former Soviet Union countries to apply for ""the near abroad"". Military experts have said this is a reference to Ukraine. Previously, a criminal record was a block for those wanting to join the mercenaries. Also restrictions were placed on anyone born outside Russia because of doubts around loyalty. Translated advert for mercenaries on the VK social media site There is a ""high demand on fighters"" and to make a difference on the ground ""they're going to need thousands of mercenaries"", says Jason Blazakis, senior research fellow at the Soufan Centre, a US-based security think tank. On Friday, the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 16,000 fighters from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army. The Russian president Vladimir Putin gave orders allowing fighters from the Middle East to be deployed in the war. It has been reported that up to 400 fighters from the Wagner group have been in Ukraine. The Wagner group was first identified in 2014, when it was backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The serving Wagner fighter explained that in the first days of the invasion of Ukraine he was sent to the country's second city, Kharkiv, where he said his unit successfully completed a mission without revealing what it was. ""We were then paid $2,100 (Â£1,600) for a month's work and returned home to Russia,"" he told the BBC. Wagner members in Syria Blazakis describes using mercenaries as a ""sign of desperation"" to keep the Russian public's support. Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has stirred several protests in Russia. Thousands have been arrested. Blazakis added that using mercenaries allows the Kremlin to ""keep the death toll down because mercenaries are used like cannon fodder"". Moscow has always denied any links with mercenary groups. The BBC asked the Russian ministry of defence whether the base in Mol'kino was being used to recruit additional forces for what the Russian authorities call ""a special military operation in Ukraine''. No response was received.

What are chemical weapons and could Russia use them?,"Britain has reacted with concern at unconfirmed reports of an alleged chemical attack in the besieged city of Mariupol. The alarm was raised by some of the last Ukrainian soldiers still holding out against the Russian assault there. They are from the Azov Battalion, a small but controversial element of Ukraine's National Guard due to their far right tendencies. They claim that after a Russian drone flew over, there was a cloud of smoke and three of their members experienced breathing difficulties. These could be symptoms consistent with a chemical or poison gas attack but this will be hard to prove. Reported chemical attack deeply concerning The global watchdog for chemical weapons - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - would usually be called in to assess any evidence. But that will be challenging in Mariupol, for obvious reasons. The former British Army officer Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert, cautioned that even if uncontaminated samples could be collected from the scene they would need to be taken to another country for analysis. This, he said, would take some time. Western governments are also able to examine satellite imagery and other intelligence for any signs that chemical weapons units or vehicles were nearby, he said. But that won't give any hard and fast answers any time soon. Britain's Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the incident needed proper investigation. He said that if Russia were found to have used banned chemical weapons then ""nothing was ruled out"" in terms of Nato's response. So what does that mean exactly? Ministers won't be drawn on the details. Even if it could be proved to be a chemical attack, Nato would still be extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the fighting inside Ukraine's borders. At most it would probably lead to yet more sanctions on Russia and a further stepping up of military hardware exports to Ukraine. Chemical weapons are any kind of munitions that carry toxins or chemical substances that attack the body's system. There are different categories of chemical weapons. Choking agents like phosgene attack the lungs and respiratory system, causing victims to drown in their lungs' secretions. There are blister agents, like mustard gas, which burn the skin and blind people. Then there is the most lethal category of all: nerve agents, which interfere with the brain's messages to the body's muscles. A tiny drop of these can be fatal. Less than 0.5mg of VX nerve agent, for example, is enough to kill an adult. Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme All of these so-called chemical agents can be used in warfare in artillery shells, bombs and missiles. However, all are strictly prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 which was signed by the vast majority of nations, including Russia. Chemical weapons were used in World War One, in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and more recently by the Syrian government against rebel forces. Russia says it destroyed the last of its chemical weapons stocks in 2017, but since then there have been at least two chemical attacks blamed on Moscow. The first was the Salisbury attack of March 2018. A former KGB officer and defector, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned along with his daughter by the nerve agent Novichok. Russia denied responsibility and came up with over 20 different explanations for who else could have done it. However, investigators concluded it was the work of two officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence. To show their disgust, countries around the world expelled a total of 128 Russian spies and diplomats. Then, in August 2020, the prominent Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was also poisoned with Novichok and narrowly escaped death. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was almost killed with by a chemical weapons attack Some military analysts fear that if the coming Russian assault in the Donbas fails to achieve its objectives then, in desperation, President Putin could authorise the use of chemical weapons on stubborn defenders. If Russia were to use weapons like poison gas in this war, it would be seen as crossing a major red line, most probably prompting calls for the West to take action. Chemical weapons played a decisive role in the Syrian government's campaign to suppress resistance in rebel-held cities, killing and incapacitating fighters and civilians alike. The Syrian air force, which reportedly carried out dozens of these attacks, was supported and protected by the Russian air force. The general in charge of Russia's war effort there, Aleksandr Dvornikov, has now been appointed to run Moscow's war against Ukraine. The unpleasant truth about chemical weapons is that if you have a protracted war, where the attacking military are trying to break the will of defending forces, then these weapons are one hideously effective way to achieve that. They not only permeate into cellars and bunkers, they can result in an agonising death and hence are also a psychological weapon of terror.

Mercenaries being recruited in Russia,"Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15 Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign. The serving mercenary said many veterans of the secretive Wagner organisation were contacted on a private Telegram group a few weeks before the start of the war. They were invited to a ""picnic in Ukraine"", with references to tasting ""Salo"", a pork fat traditionally eaten in Ukraine.

UK sanctions Russian MPs over Ukraine invasionPoliticians who voted to recognise two areas of Ukraine as independent have their UK assets frozen.UK Politics,"The sanctions will hit members of the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament The UK government has imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian parliamentarians as part of its response to the war in Ukraine. Some 386 MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent last month have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans. The UK said their recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk gave Russia a ""pretext"" for its subsequent invasion. Labour welcomed the move but said it should have happened ""weeks ago"". It follows a similar move by the European Union, which announced sanctions against hundreds of Russian MPs last month. The UK signalled it would impose sanctions of its own last month, but said more time was needed to pass new legislation before it could happen. The latest announcement means 400 of the 450 members of the Duma - the lower house of the Russian parliament - are now subject to British sanctions. They also prevent them from conducting business in the UK. Downing Street declined to say whether any of the sanctioned politicians had any assets in the UK. Ministers are yet to also target members of the Federation Council, the Russian parliament's upper house, who voted for recognition. The Foreign Office signalled its intention to do so last month. Meanwhile, No 10 said details of a UK ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia would be announced in the coming days. The product ban is part of a series ofadditional trade sanctionsannounced by the G7 group of wealthy Western nations on Friday. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? People can welcome refugees into own homes - PM Satellites show Russia convoy regrouping near Kyiv Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was targeting ""those complicit in Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war"". ""We will not let up the pressure and will continue to tighten the screw on the Russian economy through sanctions,"" she added. The move against Russian MPs follows sanctions on Russian banks, companies and oligarchs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on a further seven Russian oligarchs,including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The UK government says it means 18 Russian oligarchs, worth a combined Â£30bn, have been sanctioned since the Russian invasion began. Russia's Duma approved ""friendship treaties"" with Luhansk and Donetsk at a vote on 22 February Ministers have been coming under mounting pressure from opposition parties to increase both the speed and scale of sanctions in recent weeks. Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the latest sanctions against Duma members were welcome, but ""should have happened weeks ago"". Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran also backed the move, but said the UK had been ""moving at a snail's pace"". The government has also faced criticism over its response to the refugee crisis, amid accusations the process to apply for visas is slow and bureaucratic. The United Nations said more than 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine, but as of Thursday morning the UK had issued 1,305 visas, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said on Friday. The government has announced plans to allow Ukrainians with family in the UK to apply for visas online, without having to visit a visa centre in-person. Details of a second scheme allowing individuals and businesses to sponsor refugee visas are set to be confirmed on Monday, having originally been announced on 1 March.

UK sanctions Russian MPs over Ukraine invasionPoliticians who voted to recognise two areas of Ukraine as independent have their UK assets frozen.,"The sanctions will hit members of the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament The UK government has imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian parliamentarians as part of its response to the war in Ukraine. Some 386 MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent last month have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans. The UK said their recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk gave Russia a ""pretext"" for its subsequent invasion. Labour welcomed the move but said it should have happened ""weeks ago"". It follows a similar move by the European Union, which announced sanctions against hundreds of Russian MPs last month. The UK signalled it would impose sanctions of its own last month, but said more time was needed to pass new legislation before it could happen. The latest announcement means 400 of the 450 members of the Duma - the lower house of the Russian parliament - are now subject to British sanctions. They also prevent them from conducting business in the UK. Downing Street declined to say whether any of the sanctioned politicians had any assets in the UK. Ministers are yet to also target members of the Federation Council, the Russian parliament's upper house, who voted for recognition. The Foreign Office signalled its intention to do so last month. Meanwhile, No 10 said details of a UK ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia would be announced in the coming days. The product ban is part of a series ofadditional trade sanctionsannounced by the G7 group of wealthy Western nations on Friday. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? People can welcome refugees into own homes - PM Satellites show Russia convoy regrouping near Kyiv Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was targeting ""those complicit in Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war"". ""We will not let up the pressure and will continue to tighten the screw on the Russian economy through sanctions,"" she added. The move against Russian MPs follows sanctions on Russian banks, companies and oligarchs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on a further seven Russian oligarchs,including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The UK government says it means 18 Russian oligarchs, worth a combined Â£30bn, have been sanctioned since the Russian invasion began. Russia's Duma approved ""friendship treaties"" with Luhansk and Donetsk at a vote on 22 February Ministers have been coming under mounting pressure from opposition parties to increase both the speed and scale of sanctions in recent weeks. Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the latest sanctions against Duma members were welcome, but ""should have happened weeks ago"". Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran also backed the move, but said the UK had been ""moving at a snail's pace"". The government has also faced criticism over its response to the refugee crisis, amid accusations the process to apply for visas is slow and bureaucratic. The United Nations said more than 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine, but as of Thursday morning the UK had issued 1,305 visas, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said on Friday. The government has announced plans to allow Ukrainians with family in the UK to apply for visas online, without having to visit a visa centre in-person. Details of a second scheme allowing individuals and businesses to sponsor refugee visas are set to be confirmed on Monday, having originally been announced on 1 March.

White House officials hosted a private Zoom briefing for about 30 influential TikTok creators to keep them informed of the latest US messaging regarding Ukraine, according to the Washington Post. The briefing was conducted by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Council adviser Matt Miller. Several of the social media stars have since gone on to post about Ukraine. The topic included the US ""strategic goals in the region"", according to the Post, such as how the US would respond to a Russian nuclear escalation and how US aid dollars are being spent to help Ukraine. TikTok has been widely embraced by the Biden administration as a way to reach younger Americans who get much of their news from social media. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Olha Svyripa was woken up at 05:30 on 24 February to what she described as ""the warmest hug I ever had from my husband"". ""He said 'please wake up, it's begun'."" Two hours later, she was crammed into a small van with her husband, her best friend and four strangers, to begin what turned into an 18-hour journey from Kyiv to the relative safety of Rivne, in the west of Ukraine. ""We packed the most important stuff - documents, laptops, chargers. My husband filled my backpack with books and said: 'It might be heavy but will protect you in case of shelling'."" Olha's laptop was important because she, like many Ukrainians, wanted to carry on working despite the complete upheaval of her life and the dreadful circumstances she found herself in. Read more about Olha's story here. File photo: An estimated 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion on 24 February Guatemala has received its first arrivals on Friday of Ukrainian refugees, according to a Reuters report. Eight Ukrainians were the first to arrive in the Central American country for ""humanitarian reasons"". A further 10 Ukrainians were expected to arrive later in the day, Reuters quoted officials as saying. It is unclear how many may have arrived privately to Guatemala since the Russian attacks onUkraine began. Guatemala announced its decision to throw open its doors to Ukrainian war refugees on 6 March, when President Alejandro Giammattei said they would be ""assured refuge"" in the country. It is now slightly past 06:00 in Kyiv, and air raid sirens have blared across more than 15 regions and multiple cities in Ukraine, BBC Ukrainian has reported. They have sounded in the capital Kyiv, along with key cities like Odesa in the south, Sumy in the north, Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south-east. The aftermath of shelling in Sumy More humanitarian corridors have been agreed for the embattled northeastern city of Sumy on Saturday morning, said Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmitry Zhyvytsky in a post on Telegram. According to Zhyvytsky, evacuation efforts starting at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) will see vehicles departing from six destinations around the region. All of the convoys are headed to the central city of Poltava, and are expected to arrive between 13:00 to 14:00. As Ukraine enters its 17th day under Russian invasion, Nato has said that it will be sending troops to Norway on Monday 14 March. Some 30,000 troops, 200 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 nations are expected to take part in the Cold Response 2022 exercise, the largest exercise involving Nato troops this year. Starting on 14 March, the manoeuvres will enable western nations to hone their combat skills in Norway's cold climate, including in the Arctic, on the ground, at sea and in the skies. The exercise will be held a few hundred kilometres from the Russian border. While it was planned long before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it now has added significance because of the war. Norway's Defence Minister Odd Roger Enoksen said: ""This exercise is extremely important for the security of Norway and its allies. We will practice an allied reinforcement of Norway"". The exercise is expected to come to an end on 1 April. With fierce fighting in cities along Ukraineâs south coast, the key city of Odesa is preparing its defences. Russian landing craft have been seen off the coast, and several aircraft have been reportedly shot down. Odesa is seen as an important target, both strategic and symbolic. The BBC has obtained footage of the volunteers preparing to defend the city, just 50km (30 miles) from the border with Moldova. This video can not be played Ukraine: Preparing to defend Odesa The Chernobyl power plant, photographed three days after the 1986 meltdown Ukraine has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that technicians have begun efforts to restore the external power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said the site currently occupied by Russian troops was taken off the power grid. They later claimed that the Russians were preparing a ""terrorist attack"" that had been thwarted. Ukraine told the IAEA, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog, that work on Thursday evening successfully prepared one section, but that failures persist due to damage in other places. The agency said the work was continuing ""despite the difficult situation outside"" the former Soviet power plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986. Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, is now firmly in the sights of the Russian army. Moscow's troops invaded from the nearby Crimea peninsula and have had more success in taking territory in this region than Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine. And now reports from the city indicate that Russian forces have started to shell the city again. As the Russians work their way west towards the city people are starting to flee and the hospitals are filling with the injured. But Anastasia has decided to stay, sending her one-year-old daughter and her mother away to safety. ""I'm a mum of my baby. But I have to help because I know how to do it,"" the former army captain told the BBC. Ukrainian forces have, for more than a week now, defended the city. But Governor Vitaliy Kim warns this is not a time to celebrate prematurely. ""We are winning this fight, but not this war,"" he says. Read more about the defence of Mykolaiv here.  Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has said his country could host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Bulgarian media quoted President Radev saying that ""Bulgaria can legitmately claim to be a place for such talks, but this should be done in coordination with the European Union."" Radev added: ""We are members of the EU and we should strive for a unified European solution, a unified European approach."" On Friday, UK Minister of State for Europe and North America James Cleverly was in Bulgaria to discuss with his counterparts the crisis in Ukraine. Cleverly said the UK and Bulgaria - as Nato allies - oppose Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine. He added that Bulgaria was ""one of the first countries to close its skies to Russian aeroplanes"". Photos taken by Reuters apparently show a drone that has been rigged to drop petrol-filled bottles onto invading Russian troops. The four-blade device was apparently developed by the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces. Its use comes about two weeks after the government called for private owners to donate their drones to be outfitted for military purposes. It's unclear how the petrol in the Molotov cocktail bottle of Chernihivske beer - seen in the photo - is meant to be ignited. But the pictures show that as it falls, the bottle stays upright, in an apparent effort to keep the liquid from pouring out as it drops onto its target. Read more about Molotov cocktails in Ukrainehere The bottle stays upright after being released by the drone Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign. Read more of our investigation here. Earlier on we reported on a video address given by Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The deputy prime minister said that shelling had prevented evacuations from Mariupol, where a maternity hospital was bombed this week, and the capital Kyiv. But she said some planned evacuations had been successful, including 1,000 people who were escorted from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Vereshchuk said that there will be a further attempt to evacuate people from Mariupol on Saturday. ""Tomorrow we will do it again in front of the whole world"", she said. She added a humanitarian cargo should be delivered to Mariupol, and on the way back people will have the opportunity of being evacuated. Several attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol failed earlier this week after agreements for temporary pauses in fighting were broken. Ukrainian families are grieving the deaths of the country's fallen soldiers. The bodies of the first victims of the Ukraine-Russia war are being laid to rest. The BBC's Fergal Keane reports. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ukrainians grieve for their fallen soldiers In the last half hour, air raid sirens have gone off in the capital city and in Zhytomyr, to its west, warning residents to seek shelter underground. Reporters on the ground in Kyiv report heavy shelling currently being heard. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine as the Russian invasion enters its 17th day.  Civilians living near the Zaporizhzhia plant have fled to other parts of Ukraine The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, said Russian officials have tried to enter and take full control of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom's chief, Petro Kotin, said Russian forces had told Ukrainian staff at the plant that it now belonged to Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear company. In a televised interview, Kotin said 10 officials from Rosatom - including two senior engineers - unsuccessfully attempted to enter the plant and take control of operations. He added: ""On the territory [of the plant] there are around 500 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons â¦ our staff are in an extremely bad psychological state."" Kotin said on Friday that the radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear plant is still safely housed in storage, but warned that the plant remains disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems. The head of Instagram says that Russia's decision to block the social media platform means that tens of millions of Russians will on Monday lose access to the site and app. ""On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia,"" tweeted Adam Mosseri. ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong."" Russia made the move on Friday after Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said that it would temporarily suspend its own rules to allow for violent threats against Russian troops. Meta's head of global affairs said earlier today that the company's changes on speech in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only apply in Ukraine itself and were temporary.

The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied as she descended rubble-strewn steps, was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people. She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Mariana became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Mariana was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. Read more about Mariana's story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

In a statement, the IAEA said that while Ukraine reported on Sunday that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine's power grid, transmission system operator Ukrenergo later said it had again been damaged ""by the occupying forces"". Power, however, was restored at around 13:10 local time (12:10 GMT). IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi said that the power issues at the plant ""underline the urgency"" of an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to regulate their nuclear sites. The IAEA said it is also looking into reporters that Russian forces ""have carried out munition explosions"" at Europe's largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhya plant. Allow Twitter content?

If you're just joining us, here's some of the latest developments from Russia's invasion of Ukraine: US officials believe Russian ballistic missiles being
fired into Ukraine are equipped with a previously unknown decoy device that
allows them to avoid interception, according to the New York Times. Citing an unnamed US official, the Times reported that the
devices â attached to Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles â are each about
a foot-long and contain equipment that produces radio signals to jam radar
detection. Additionally, each device contains a heat source to attract
incoming missiles. The US official told the Times that similar ""penetration
aids"" have been used on nuclear warheads since the 1970s. Various images of the devices have been shared on social
media by weapons and munitions experts who had been unable to identify them. Earlier on Monday, a senior US defence official told
reporters Russia has launched 900 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine
began on 24 February. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg Japan's finance ministry has frozen the assets of more Russian individuals over the country's invasion of Ukraine. It has sanctioned,external11 members of the State Duma, a chamber of Russia's Parliament, five relatives of banker Yuri Kovalchuk and billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. This brings the number of Russians who have been targeted by Japanese sanctions to 61, the ministry said. New Zealand Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi in December New Zealand plans to take in 4,000 relatives of Ukrainian-born New Zealand citizens and residents, Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi has announced. ""This is the largest special visa category we have established in decades to support an international humanitarian effort,"" Faafoi said. The initiative will be open for one year. Successful applicants will be granted two-year visas with work rights, and their children will be allowed to attend schools in New Zealand. Faafoi said the programme would allow ""the estimated 1,600 Ukrainian-born citizens and residents in New Zealand to sponsor parents, grandparents and adult siblings or adult children and their immediate family who are ordinarily resident in Ukraine to shelter safely here"". More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Dvorkovich, seated on Putin's right side, during a meeting in 2018 Arkady Dvorkovich, the head of the World Chess Organization (FIDE), who served as Russia's Deputy Prime Minister from 2012-18, has condemned the war in an interview with a US publication,Mother Jones,external. ""Wars are the worst thing in life. Any wars. Anywhere. Including this war,"" he said from an undisclosed location inside Russia. ""Wars do not just take precious lives. Wars take away dreams and aspirations, freeze and destroy relationships and ties."" Earlier this month, FIDE officials unanimously condemned Russia for its invasion, and banned Russia and Belarus from competition. It also stripped the title of ambassador for life from former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov, a current Russian MP who voted in the State Duma for recognition of two separatist-backed regions of eastern Ukraine. Several Ukrainian chess players have also criticised Dvorkovich for his previous work for the Russian government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says peace talks with Russia - now in their fourth round - will continue on Tuesday in Turkey. Releasing a video address on Facebook, he said he was informed that talks have been going ""pretty good"". ""But let's see. They will continue tomorrow,"" he said. He added that Ukrainian forces were able to help 3,806 people flee from the Luhansk and Kyiv regions on Monday. A convoy of 100 tonnes of supplies was still stuck in Berdyansk, he said, unable to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol. He added that Russian troops were ""confused"" and ""did not expect such resistance"" from Ukraine. ""They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment"" he claimed. ""We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare."" Zelensky also thanked Russian civilians who have protested and sought to spread the truth about the war - paying his personal thanks to a protester who held up an anti-war sign on Russia's Channel One news earlier on Monday. Pedestrians walk among anti-tank barriers in Odesa on Monday The latest intelligence assessment from the UK Ministry of Defense says that Russia is baselessly continuing to accuse Ukraine of intending to commit a chemical or biological attack. Russia, the MoD bulletin says without citing evidence, ""could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a false flag operation"". The operation ""could"" take the form of a failed attack, a staged discovery of Ukrainian agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian government decision-making. It ""would almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution"", the ministry said on Twitter. A false flag is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it. Read more about the history of false flag operations here: False flags: What are they and when have they been used? A Ukrainian armour repair plant pictured in 2014 Russia's defence ministry says it will target Ukrainian defence industry companies in response to what it describes as a Ukrainian ballistic missile attack on the separatist stronghold of Donetsk earlier on Monday. In an onlinepost,external, the Russian defence ministry writes: ""In response to the shelling of Donetsk with a Tochka-U missile, Russian armed forces will take operational measures to put out of use Ukrainian defence industry enterprises which produce weapons used by the nationalists. ""We call on Ukrainian citizens who work at these enterprises, as well as residents of nearby houses, to leave the potentially dangerous areas."" Moscow earlier alleged 20 civilians had died in a Ukrainian air strike on Donetsk, involving cluster munitions carried by a Tochka-U ballistic missile. Ukraine denied carrying out the attack and claimed a Russian missile was responsible. This is the second time Russia has warned of a strike against Ukrainian facilities. After the first such warning on 1 March, at least five people died in anattack targeting the Kyiv TV tower. US President Joe Biden has vowed to continue supplying weapons, food and money to help Ukraine. In a tweet, Biden said the US would also ""welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms"". Earlier on Monday, Biden said the US was providing ""tens of thousands of tons of humanitarian supplies"" on a daily basis. On Friday, Biden signed an emergency spending package that earmarked $13.6bn in aid for Ukraine, about half of which was for military aid. On Monday, CNN also reported the Biden administration was considering expediting immigration proceedings for displaced Ukrainians with ties to the US. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters in London briefly seized a building thought to belong to a Putin ally on Monday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new sanctions on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, the BBC has learned. This is to be implemented via emergency legislation as part of the Economic Crime Bill, which has just passed the UK Parliament. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet that he and his Canadian counterpart MÃ©lanie Joly (pictured) agreed sanctions against Russia should be increased Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says he held a call with Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs MÃ©lanie Joly to discuss ""ways to stop Russian aggression"" against Ukraine. In a tweet, Kuleba said that he and Joly agreed that sanctions pressure on Russia will ""increase"". ""Canada supports Ukraine on all fronts,"" he added. On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced more sanctions on five Russian citizens - including Roman Abramovich - and said 32 Russian companies and government entities would be barred from receiving defence equipment or supplies. Trudeau also said the Canadian government was looking at a number of options to help Ukrainian citizens and wouldn't rule out an airlift. You'll Never Drink Alone were the words that hung above the bar at the Old Hem, an iconic pub in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. But the pub, named after legendary American writer Ernest Hemingway and popular among the city's young creatives, now lies in ruins. It was completely destroyed during Russian shelling of the city. The Kharkiv prosecutor's office says two people died in the attack. Site of the destroyed Old Hem pub in Kharkiv, Ukraine The bar's owner, Kostiantyn Kuts, told the BBC that no staff were in the bar when it was hit, and those who died were in apartments above. The Old Hem stopped pouring pints and turned into a makeshift bomb shelter when the Russian army invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Kuts says. He initially hoped he'd only be shutting briefly. President Putin has implemented a new law making it harder for foreign aircraft leasing companies to repossess their planes as Western sanctions begin to take effect. The new law will allow foreign jets to be registered in Russia ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". Critics say it will allow Russia to seize privately-owned planes and put them to domestic use in the vast country. Russian airlines have 515 jets leased from abroad worth about $10bn (Â£7.7bn). Foreign owners have until 28 March to get them back from Russian companies before sanctions kick in. But, as BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett explains, it's one thing to steal aircraft, it's quite another to keep them operating for any length of time. If Russia does go ahead and seize foreign owned planes, it will immediately struggle to maintain them. Read more: Putin changes law on leased jets to keep them flying Ukraine's defence minister has praised those defending the country and says strengthening air and missile capabilities are now the top priority. ""We are working around the clock to obtain respective support or purchase the required weaponry,"" Oleksiy Reznikov writes in a Facebook post. ""Our defenders, our brave men and women are continuing to inflict significant losses on the Russian invaders every single day,"" he says. ""Our army, national and border guards, soldiers from all defence sectors are constantly sending these uninvited guests back home."" Reznikov goes on to say that the Ukrainian army is ""among the best in the world and the strongest in Europe"". This video can not be played Ukraine war: Demonstrator disrupts Russia's flagship evening news broadcast More news now following our earlier report on the anti-war protester who ran onto the set of a Russian state-controlled TV channel with a sign reading: ""They are lying to you."" Before the stunt, which was broadcast live on Russia's Channel One, protester Marina Ovsyannikova recorded a video in which she called events in Ukraine a ""crime"". ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" Ovsyannikova, an editor at the channel, explained. She called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying that only they could ""stop the madness"". Ovsyannikova is now in police custody. Pro-Ukraine demonstrators outside the ICJ in the Hague on 7 March The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague has said it will rule on Wednesday on a case brought by Ukraine against Russia, accusing it of falsely justifying its invasion. Ukraine filed the case soon after the Russian invasion on 24 February. It accuses Russia of using false claims that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide in separatist-held areas of the Donbas region as a pretext to attack. Russian officials did not appear at an earlier hearing at the UN's World Court on 7 March. In a statement, the ICJ said that the court will deliver its order at 1600 local time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, 16 March. A separate war crimes investigation has also been launched by the International Criminal Court to look into allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine. We reported earlier about a missile strike in the separatist-controlled Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, which Russia claimed - without providing evidence - was launched by Ukrainian forces. Now Ukraine's defence ministry is saying that it was ""undoubtedly a Russian missile"", according to local media. ""There's not even any point talking about it,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said during a televised address, accusing Russia of using the strike as ""propaganda"". Russian media reported earlier that a Ukrainian missile hit the centre of Donetsk, killing 20 people and injuring several more, and accused Kyiv of committing a war crime. Donetsk is one of the rebel-held separatist areas where fighting against Ukrainian forces has been taking place since 2014. Brent Renaud, 50, was a journalist and filmmaker and was shot dead in the town of Irpin, outside Kyiv. He had been working in the region at the time of his death. Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital. It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine. Renaud had reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti. He won a Peabody Award for his work on a 2014 series on Chicago schools, Last Chance High. He often worked alongside his brother, Craig, also a filmmaker. It is not known whether Craig also travelled to Ukraine. Photographs are circulating online showing a press ID for Renaud issued by the New York Times. In a statement, the newspaper said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Renaud's death but that he had not been working for the newspaper in Ukraine. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.
