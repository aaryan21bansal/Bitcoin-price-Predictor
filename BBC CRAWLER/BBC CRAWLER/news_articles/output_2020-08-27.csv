LiveLiveTrump to attack Biden and speak about unrest10 minutes ago,"Donald Trump formally accepts the Republican nomination to run for president in the 3 November US election Speaking at the White House, Trump presents himself as the law and order candidate, and laying into Democratic challenger Joe Biden Critics question whether the president should have used the White House for partisan political campaigning during his party convention The speech came amid simmering tension over police shootings and racism Trump talked about the unrest in American cities, including Kenosha, Minneapolis, and Chicago, but did not mention Jacob Blake's shooting His speech closed out the Republican convention, and heralded intense campaigning ahead of the election Edited by Matthew Davis Thank you for joining our coverage of the final night of the Republican convention, where Donald Trump gave a major speech as he accepted the party's nomination to run for a second term as president. Some of tonight's major moments: Live reporting by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Anthony Zurcher, Holly Honderich, Max Matza, Sam Cabral, Robin Levinson-King, Marianna Brady, Josh Cheetham, Ben Bevington and Tom Geoghegan. Donald Trump is known for his at-times-bombastic speeches. But during his address at the Republican convention, the president seemed surprisingly low-key. On Twitter, the hashtag #lowenergydonald was one of the top trends of the night, with people accusing him of rambling through his 70-minute keynote. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump is famously attuned to his own ratings. So what did the press make of his big speech? The New York Times notes Trump's warning on Biden (he mentioned his rival 42 times by name tonight), a theme echoed by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post, too, noted the Biden-bashing and the broader attacks on Democratic leaders across the country. Fox News online is fairly measured, focusing on Trump's law and order message, which was a theme we have seen repeated throughout the four days of the Republican convention. Phillip Robinson, 50, Independent -âA speech is there to provoke an emotional response to a candidate and sadly I lack emotion. A lot of what was said was not the whole truth, and a lot of fear-mongering. It created a narrative. The speech was powerful. The end of the speech was brilliant. But I have not been swayed by it. If I had to vote today, I would vote for Joe Biden only because I am really tired of hearing the president say things that are not the truth or not the whole truth. I would have to vote for anyone who tells the truth.â Cat Lewis, 56, Republican -âIt met all my criteria I wanted in an acceptance speech. The base is going to feel really good about it â to go vote and to take five people to the polls with them. It did what it was supposed to do."" Miriam Weinraub, 19, Democrat -âI agree this speech was for the base. My bar for his ability to stick with the script is very low, so he did well. I have a lot of problems with the lies. It was very repetitive and rambling. Here is the Republican Party, here are our beliefs and nobody else is rightâ¦ I wanted to hear more, as a young voter, about being a united country, rather than right or left.â Gabriel Montalvo, 21, Republican -âThe speech was for the Republican base that knows theyâre gonna be voting for him. He hit what I, and I'm sure others, believe are key points. He hit those points that I think many people want to hear his thoughts and opinions on, then looped back to his accomplishments. Itâs very important for me, as a Hispanic American, to hear him talk about the differences between right and left.â By Adam Gingrich, political consultant and former Trump campaign operative. Hurricanes, wildfires, a pandemic and urban riots. You might think Americans were having a bad week. Donald Trump has a different view. Tonight, Trump was the first president since Franklin Roosevelt to accept his partyâs nomination from the White House. While not unprecedented, itâs certainly a new optic for the American voters. But, then again, in 2020, what isnât? Trump used his prime time spot to illustrate his strengths, capitalise on good economic news, and spoke with grave sincerity about the damage that Covid-19 has wrought upon our nation. He eloquently contrasted his record of achievement in one term with Bidenâs 47 years in DC, and he did it effectively. But in my opinion, the president was overshadowed by the incredibly emotional prior speeches by the widow of slain Captain David Dorn, the parents of Kayla Mueller and the face of Trumpâs âFirst Step Act,â Alice Marie Johnson. As Trump reinforced his message tonight, he stood little chance of eclipsing the night that unfurled before him. Overall, the night was an emphatic and emotional win, not just for Trump, but for all Americans. A win tonight for Trump, but above all: a win for the Republican ticket nationwide. The year 2020 is a year of chaos. Well, year 2020, meet the man who was born to lead in this environment; and that man is not Joe Biden. Thatâs what we learned tonight. Deanna Lusk, a 37-year-old legal assistant in Derby, Kansas, has just given us her reaction to Trump's acceptance speech. âI really like the fact that he spoke about Alice Johnson regarding the justice reform thatâs affecting a lot of Americans,â she tells BBC News, referring to the woman who spent 22 years in prison, had her sentence commuted by Trump and spoke tonight. âHe said America is the torch that lights the rest of the world I thought that was pretty accurate,â Lusk continues. On Covid-19, Lusk says Trump ""has more of a detailed plan for the country moving forward, given everything that weâve been through this past yearâ compared to Democrat Joe Biden. âI think he has more of a direction. Biden may have a plan but nobody really knows what thatâs going to be - what that entails. [Trump] comes across as more organised about what needs to happen.â She says she is planning to vote for Trump in November. Brooke Riske says that Trump has her vote this November Brooke Riske is a 34-year-old mother and an independent voter from Roanoke, Virginia. Up until recently, she has felt disengaged from politics, and voted for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson in 2016. This year, however, she will cast her vote for Trump's re-election. ""Cancel culture... that's what drew me to Trump,"" Riske says, just after watching the president's speech. ""It doesn't even feel like America anymore, it feels like we have to walk on egg shells."" Riske says she liked Trump's performance tonight. ""I wasn't blown away, but I didn't see any yellow or red flags,"" she says. ""I feel affirmed in my vote."" And Trump's uncharacteristically level delivery appealed: ""I felt like he was very even keeled compared to how he can be at times,"" she says. Now, Riske is looking forward to November's election. ""I'm really hopeful that some of this negativity will dissipate,"" she says. ""I'm ready to close the election chapter and just get back to living.""   Reality Check Mr Trump criticised Joe Bidenâs tax plan which he said would hit American families. âHe has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets.â Trump is correct that the Biden plan would lead to $4 trillion in revenues â over the next decade - according to analysis by the Tax Policy Centre. However, the claim is misleading as the taxes would target the wealthiest Americans - not âalmost all familiesâ. The Tax Policy Centre found that 93% of the tax increases would be paid by taxpayers in the top fifth of households. The high earners would see âsubstantially larger tax increases than households in other income groups, both in dollar amounts and as share of their incomes.â Joe Biden has also told ABC News that he would not raise taxes for anyone making under $400,000 a year. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter In a ponderous, hour-long speech
more akin to a State of the Union address than a nomination acceptance, Donald
Trump alternated between ticking through his record as president and circling
around, like a prize fighter, to launch strikes on his Democratic opponent, Joe
Biden. It was a
blunderbuss of attacks, of varying levels of validity, in the hope that some
will draw blood â on trade, immigration, education, energy and foreign policy.
But most of all, Trump sought to paint Biden as in league with the protesters
on the streets and the more left-wing members of the Democratic Party. âBiden
is a Trojan horse for socialism,â Trump said. âIf Joe Biden doesn't have the
strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow
radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you?â The
presidentâs speech ended with a laundry list of promises for his second-term
goals. âThis is
the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together,â he said. The setting of the speech was
majestic â on the grounds of the White House and in view of the Washington
monument. The delivery from a president who
thrives more on rousing rallies than rhetorical set-pieces, however, frequently
landed with a thud. Trump has now laid out a laundry list of second term promises, pledging to put a woman on the moon and a US flag on Mars, winning the race to develop 5G technology and creating a ""unifying national agenda that will bring our country together"". He's taken numerous shots at his challenger, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat is on the side of radical socialist mobs and the elite political class, and that he is owned by the Chinese communist government. This speech has laid out the clearest contrast between him and Biden, who promised last week to restore American ""dignity"" with Trump out of the White House. Ending his speech he declares: ""Together, we are unstoppable. ""Together, we are unbeatable. Because
together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America ""And on November
3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make
America prouder, and we will make America greater than ever before."" A huge firework display around the Washington Monument caps the end of one of the longest acceptance speeches in US political convention history. Trump's children applaud him as he speaks Images from the convention tonight show social distancing isn't being practiced by crowds of Trump supporters seated outside the White House. It's not gone unnoticed by Kamala Harris - the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Clockwise from top left: Phillip Robinson, Cat Lewis, Miriam Weinraub and Gabriel Montalvo Tonight, Trump has talked about Covid-19 - ""the silent enemy"" - which he frequently calls the ""China virus"". How American voters think he handled the US outbreak will surely be on their minds when they cast their ballot in November. Here's what some are thinking tonight: Phillip Robinson, 50, Independent -âLabeling a virus by a group of people is by definition racist... The economy cannot dictate the response to this virusâ¦ We have no choice but to hide.â Cat Lewis, 56, Republican -âI live in North Carolina and weâre in Phase Two, so thereâs a lot of our state that is shut down right now. This virus is destroying the economy. We have to open up. We have a lot of people out of work. More shutdowns will not work.â Miriam Weinraub, 19, DemocratââI find it surprising how he talked about the pandemic because theyâve barely discussed the coronavirus throughout this convention. Iâd rather have a struggling economy than people dying. It is incredibly disheartening to hear how the economy is more important than America citizens.â (Miriam has lost family members to the illness) Gabriel Montalvo, 21, RepublicanââI am from Queens, New York, the epicentre of the virus. We are moving past it and states are starting to open up... Kamala Harris blamed the Chinese government, too, earlier today. Both sides of the political aisle can agree that this started in one place: Communist China."" Reality Check Trump has been defending his governmentâs record in tackling the coronavirus pandemic at the Republican National Convention. He said âthe United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world"". This is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases measuring the number of death per positive tests of coronavirus. Itâs true this figure is relatively low for the US compared with most major European countries, including the UK. However, the numbers in Norway, Japan, and South Korea are all lower than the US though. Moreover, different countries are testing to find coronavirus cases in different ways, meaning the statistic is a hard comparison to make. A low case fatality rate could mean that widespread testing identifies lots of mild cases who were unlikely to die in the first place. You can read more about the US record on tackling Covid-19 here. Trump has just addressed the protests against racism and police brutality that have swept the nation since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. He says that the majority of police officers are good, but adds: ""When there is police
misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely
accountable, and it will."" ""But
what we can never have in America â and must never allow â is mob rule. In the
strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting,
arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha,
Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York."" He says Democrats are on the side of violent protesters, and have allowed anarchy on the streets of US cities. However, he never once mentioned Jacob Blake, the black man who was shot seven times in the back by a police officer on Sunday, spurring the latest protests in Kenosha. Reality Check The president claimed the United States had âobliterated 100 percent of the Isis Caliphateâ. Itâs true the Islamic State groupâs territory - a âcaliphateâ declared in 2014 - came to an end during the Trump era. The US-led alliance overran the group's last stronghold in Syria in March 2019. But as the BBC reported at the time, âdespite the demise of its physical caliphate, IS remains a battle-hardened and well-disciplined force whose 'enduring defeat' is not assured.â On 12 August a senior US military official laid out what was still needed,externalfor an enduring defeat against Isis, noting the group still poses a threat. Nominating conservative judges was a big campaign promise for Trump in 2016, and he's taking about it tonight - the selection of ""two great new Supreme Court Justices"". And that he did: With two appointments already in the president's first term, the bench's ideological balance tilts right, favouring conservatives in a 5-4 split. The court is now called the most conservative-leaning court in modern US history. But how have the justices issued their decisions? The BBC's Anthony Zurcher takes a look at the last Supreme Court term, to see if this conservative-leaning court actually votes that way. Clockwise from top left: Miriam Weinraub, Gabriel Montalvo, Phillip Robinson, Cat Lewis Trump is going through a laundry list of his first-term accomplishments, telling voters he can do more with another four years. But do voters agree? Here's what our voter panel told us: Cat Lewis, 56, Republicanâ""He has kept his promises. Built the wall, healthcare, the trade agreements with China, getting out of Nafta. Some of the things he promised on the campaign trail, he came through.â Miriam Weinraub, 19, Democratâ""A lot of the promises - he hasn't done them in the way he said"",she says, citing his failure to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, RepublicanââI certainly think President Trump has kept his promises. He has worked on immigration reform. He has built the economy. We have had justice reform, which had not been touched. He has made us energy independent.â Katty KayWorld News America presenter The choice of the White House as a venue for a party convention speech might have been controversial, but Trump is not making any apologies for it. And the stagecraft is stunning. Trump usually prefers to speak without a prompter â heâs sticking to it tonight but itâs certainly not his strength. His attacks just donât land as hard when delivered like this. The speech doesnât have same energy as when he just riffs at a rally. This increasingly feels like a State of the Union Address  - with a laundry list of achievements - rather than a campaign speech. Iâm willing to bet this speech (so far) will be remembered in history more for the setting than the content. Referring to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"", Trump has spent much of his speech attacking China for unleashing the Covid-19 pandemic on the world. He repeatedly says that Biden is a puppet of China, and at one point asks nurses and first responders in the audience to stand for applause. ""China
would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them
fully accountable for the tragedy they caused."" He adds that he himself has lost friends and loved ones to Covid-19 and touts the administration's role building ventilators for patients in the early days of the US outbreak. ""Unfortunately,
from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but
a partisan ability to criticise,"" he continues. ""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban
on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to
Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died."" Reality Check President Trump said 300 miles of border wall have been built since heâs been in office. Since January 2017, when he assumed the presidency, 275 miles of wall have been completed, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection report. However, most of that was to replace existing structures on the border. A total of 245 miles of wall has been built in place of old barriers. Only 30 miles of new wall, where no barriers previously existed, have been newly erected. Out of the 275 miles of wall built, 41 miles are so-called âsecondary wallâ, which is constructed behind the primary border barrier. In the 2016 race for president, Trump made building a wall along the USâs southern border with Mexico a key policy of his campaign, promising a ""big, beautiful"" structure along the 2,000 mile frontier. About 650 miles of fencing was built under President George W Bush. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Switzerland and Czech Republic added to quarantine listTravellers in Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic must quarantine on return from Saturday.","Tourists wearing face coverings visit Switzerland's Matterhorn mountain Travellers to Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic who return to the UK from 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. The UK government said the move was needed to keep UK infection rates down. People arriving in Scotland from Switzerlandare already required to self-isolate. Cuba,where there has been a drop in cases,will be added to the list of destinations people can return from without entering quarantine. The UK considers imposing quarantine conditions when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The government saidthere has been a ""consistent increase"" in the weekly case rate in Switzerland,externalover the past four weeks, with cases per 100,000 rising from 18.5 to 22 over the past week. In Jamaica, the seven-day rate rose from 4.3 on August 20 to 20.8 on Thursday - a 382% increase, while the Czech Republic has seen weekly cases per 100,000 rise from 16.2 on 20 August to 20.2 on Thursday. More than 1.6 million Britons travelled to Switzerland last year, the Swiss Tourism Federation said, drawn by the Alps and the mountain air. The Czech Republic sees more than 300,000 British tourists every year, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The capital Prague is a popular destination for city breaks and stag parties. Katarina Hobbs, director of CzechTourism UK and Ireland, insists the country ""remains a safe country to travel to"", adding she hoped the British government would reconsider its decision ""very soon"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) The Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential travel to the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland. UK tourists in those countries are being told to follow local rules and check the FCO travel advice. In a tweet,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned British holidaymakers to ""only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14-day quarantine on return"". People wishing to avoid the need to self-isolate now face a race to get back to the UK before the quarantine deadline. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, told the BBC fares ""went through the roof"" within minutes of No 10's announcement, with airlines including British Airways adding extra flights to Heathrow from Prague, Geneva and Zurich priced at about ""Â£300 one way"". He alsowrote in the Independent,external, that a ""significant number"" of UK tourists with family connections to Jamaica were understood to be on the Caribbean island but warned it might be too late for them to return by Saturday's deadline if they missed Thursday's overnight flights - which go through America. He advised travellers leaving Switzerland to avoid flying via Basel airport as its terminal and runway sat inside French territory, and, according to the DfT, would trigger the need to quarantine. Liechtenstein is now also off-limits, he added, because it is only accessible through Switzerland and Austria - which is also on the government's quarantine list. The Czech Republic loosened its lockdown restrictions in July In July,thousands of guests sat at a 500 metre-long (1,640ft) table on the Charles Bridgein Prague at a party held to give the coronavirus a ""symbolic farewell"". The event's organiser said the celebration in the Czech capital was made possible by a lack of tourists in the city. In Switzerland, a state of emergency was declared in March, with the government ordering the closure of schools, restaurants, bars and all the ski slopes. But by June,as cases of Covid-19 started to fall across Europe and more travel was permitted, it reopened its mountain railwaysand cable cars. Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? France added to UK quarantine countries You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Tom Brodie, who lives in the Rhone Valley in Switzerland, set up his own adventure travel business in January before coronavirus restrictions ""decimated"" his summer season and he had to refund his bookings. Mr Brodie, originally from Birkenhead, Wirral, recently re-launched Alps Adventures - which gets most of its business from the UK - but now fears people will cancel their winter bookings if Switzerland remains on the quarantine list. He says he is trying to see the ""silver linings"", including flights being cheaper in the winter, but admits it will be ""very tough"" as no-one will want to book flights now. Meanwhile, Julian Griffiths is driving back from Switzerland, where he lives, a week earlier than planned to get his daughter back to the UK for the start of the new school term. He questioned whether he was more at risk of catching coronavirus in Switzerland than in the UK. ""I think the number of cases is based on the level of testing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""When I had a test for Covid, I just went to my local doctor's, he did the test, gave me the results 10 minutes later, and it's the same for anybody in Switzerland."" Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately, but the DfT said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Wales has made one further change - adding Singapore to its list of exemptions. Gibraltar remains on the UK's quarantine exemption list despiteconcern about a rising number of Covid cases. Last week restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal but added for travellers coming back fromCroatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. In July, travellers returning to theUK from Spain were caught out by the government's decision to advise against all but non-essential travelto the mainland and islands after a spike in cases in the country. And two weeks ago,visitors to France were given a few days' notice that they would face a quarantineon their return home to the UK. On their own, the three latest countries to join the UK's quarantine list won't affect a huge number of people. But over the past month, the government has scrapped so-called travel corridors - meaning people don't have to self-isolate - with at least 18 countries and territories, including key tourist destinations like France and Spain. Ministers say this cautious approach will prevent cases of the virus being imported. However, travel companies are frustrated that the UK hasn't yet followed countries like France and Germany and set-up a testing regime for passengers arriving from ""at risk"" countries, so that people who test negative can leave quarantine early. The UK government is said to be considering a two-test regime whereby passengers would test on arrival and then go into quarantine for eight days until a second test. Two negative results would mean they would avoid the remaining six days of quarantine. Figures within the aviation sector say that approach is too cautious and would do little to kick-start foreign travel. There has been widespread criticism of the government's weekly reviews of travel restrictions. The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, said many holidaymakers found themselves ""held to ransom"" by airlines when trying to purchase new flights to beat the quarantine deadlines. He called for greater transparency from the government so people had the necessary information in advance to decide whether it was safe to travel. ""Struggling tour operators can offer them trips to alternative destinations, rather than facing the financial hit of yet more cancellations and refund pay-outs,"" he added. Meanwhile, airport operator the Manchester Airport Group has called for an end to the UK's ""sluggish, illogical and chaotic"" approach to quarantine. Its chief strategy officer, Tim Hawkins, said: ""These decisions aren't being made anywhere near quick enough"". The Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (Abta) warned the travel sector would ""continue to suffer"" for as long as quarantine remains the government's ""principal strategy"" in containing the virus. A spokesperson said it was ""vital"" for the government to ""assess risk on a regionalised"" basis - allowing travel to areas in a country unaffected by a spike in cases - rather than a blanket one, in order to minimise the impact on the sector and consumer confidence.

Mr Brodie, originally from Birkenhead, Wirral, recently re-launched Alps Adventures - which gets most of its business from the UK - but now fears people will cancel their winter bookings if Switzerland remains on the quarantine list. He says he is trying to see the ""silver linings"", including flights being cheaper in the winter, but admits it will be ""very tough"" as no-one will want to book flights now. Meanwhile, Julian Griffiths is driving back from Switzerland, where he lives, a week earlier than planned to get his daughter back to the UK for the start of the new school term. He questioned whether he was more at risk of catching coronavirus in Switzerland than in the UK. ""I think the number of cases is based on the level of testing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""When I had a test for Covid, I just went to my local doctor's, he did the test, gave me the results 10 minutes later, and it's the same for anybody in Switzerland."" Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately, but the DfT said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Wales has made one further change - adding Singapore to its list of exemptions. Gibraltar remains on the UK's quarantine exemption list despiteconcern about a rising number of Covid cases. Last week restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal but added for travellers coming back fromCroatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. In July, travellers returning to theUK from Spain were caught out by the government's decision to advise against all but non-essential travelto the mainland and islands after a spike in cases in the country. And two weeks ago,visitors to France were given a few days' notice that they would face a quarantineon their return home to the UK. On their own, the three latest countries to join the UK's quarantine list won't affect a huge number of people. But over the past month, the government has scrapped so-called travel corridors - meaning people don't have to self-isolate - with at least 18 countries and territories, including key tourist destinations like France and Spain. Ministers say this cautious approach will prevent cases of the virus being imported. However, travel companies are frustrated that the UK hasn't yet followed countries like France and Germany and set-up a testing regime for passengers arriving from ""at risk"" countries, so that people who test negative can leave quarantine early. The UK government is said to be considering a two-test regime whereby passengers would test on arrival and then go into quarantine for eight days until a second test. Two negative results would mean they would avoid the remaining six days of quarantine. Figures within the aviation sector say that approach is too cautious and would do little to kick-start foreign travel. There has been widespread criticism of the government's weekly reviews of travel restrictions. The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, said many holidaymakers found themselves ""held to ransom"" by airlines when trying to purchase new flights to beat the quarantine deadlines. He called for greater transparency from the government so people had the necessary information in advance to decide whether it was safe to travel. ""Struggling tour operators can offer them trips to alternative destinations, rather than facing the financial hit of yet more cancellations and refund pay-outs,"" he added. Meanwhile, airport operator the Manchester Airport Group has called for an end to the UK's ""sluggish, illogical and chaotic"" approach to quarantine. Its chief strategy officer, Tim Hawkins, said: ""These decisions aren't being made anywhere near quick enough"". The Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (Abta) warned the travel sector would ""continue to suffer"" for as long as quarantine remains the government's ""principal strategy"" in containing the virus. A spokesperson said it was ""vital"" for the government to ""assess risk on a regionalised"" basis - allowing travel to areas in a country unaffected by a spike in cases - rather than a blanket one, in order to minimise the impact on the sector and consumer confidence.

Four die as Hurricane Laura batters Louisiana,"This video can not be played Hurricane Laura left a trail of destruction in Louisiana and Texas At least six people have been killed as Hurricane Laura battered the US state of Louisiana. Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant. But the feared 20ft (6m) storm surge was avoided as the hurricane, the state's biggest, tracked further east. Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status. It has since crossed into Arkansas. At 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Thursdaythe National Hurricane Center said the storm had weakened to maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h),external, but was still bringing heavy rainfall. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state ""did not sustain and suffer the absolute, catastrophic damage that we thought was likely,"" but stressed they had still suffered ""a tremendous amount of damage"" and warned people to remain vigilant.

President Donald Trump was briefed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in Washington and said he would go to the area at the weekend. He said he had been prepared to postpone his speech at the Republican National Convention later on Thursday to travel to the region but added: ""We got a bit lucky. It was very big and very powerful but it passed quickly.""  The president will visit the states affected at the weekend. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier swept across the Caribbean, killing 24 people. At least six people are known to have died after the storm crashed into the US, Gov Edwards told reporters. Of those, four were killed by falling trees. One man drowned in a boat that sank and another died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in his home, authorities said. Residents were told to stay indoors as a ""chemical fire"" was tackled near Lake Charles There was more structural damage from winds than anticipated, but the water damage was less than feared. Nearly 900,000 homes and businesses lost power as the storm hit the US. A barge had collided with a bridge in the city of Lake Charles, quite close to where a suspected ""chlorine chemical fire"" at an industrial plant was being attended by emergency services. More than half a million homes in Louisiana were reported to be without power Mr Edwards said people should stay off the roads where possible, as outer bands of the storm were still causing high water levels and winds. Some 1,500 people, including National Guard troops, are being deployed in rescue and clean-up missions. Vice-President Mike Pence, who joined Mr Trump at Fema, said: ""While this was a major storm with devastating impact it was not as bad as it could have been."" It was one of the strongest to ever hit the US Gulf Coast, striking as a category four with winds of up to 150mph (240km/h). Governor Edwards said it was even more powerful than Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people. Debbie Darscheid and her family surveying the damage at their house after Hurricane Laura passed through Lake Charles It made landfall shortly after midnight local time (05:00 GMT) near the district of Cameron, in Louisiana. It tracked north, just east of the Texas-Louisiana border. As yet, there have been no casualties confirmed in Texas.Governor Greg Abbott toured the area hit by the storm,externalwith the US Coast Guard on Thursday, and said the state was ""ready to help communities rebuild"". Lake Charles, a city of 78,000, and its surrounding areas were badly hit. Trees and electricity pylons have been ripped from the ground and vehicles overturned.

Ahead of the hurricane's arrival, more than 420,000 Texas residents were ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. The evacuations were complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. One person headed to a Texas shelter, Eric Daw, told Reuters: ""They say we are all supposed to socially distance now. But how am I supposed to socially distance in a shelter?"" A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Father on FBI's most wanted list captured,"Yaser Abdel Said, 63, was wanted by the FBI in connection with the killings of his daughters for 12 years A taxi driver wanted on suspicion of murdering his teen daughters has been arrested after 12 years on the run. A warrant for Yaser Abdel Said's arrest was issued the day after the 2008 shootings of his daughters, Sarah Yaser Said, 17, and Amina Yaser Said, 18. The Egyptian-born suspect was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in 2014. Almost seven years on, he has been taken into custody in Justin, Texas, with two relatives arrested as well. The 63-year-old will soon be transferred to Dallas County, the FBI's Dallas branch saidin a statement released on Wednesday,external. ""The FBI-led Dallas Violent Crimes Task Force has worked tirelessly to find Yaser Abdel Said,"" said FBI Dallas special agent Matthew DeSarno. ""These experienced investigators never gave up on their quest to find him and pledged to never forget the young victims in this case."" The mother of the girls, Patricia Owens, said she was happy to hear of the arrest, telling local media: ""Now the girls can rest in peace."" The FBI also announced two other arrests,CBS DFW reported,external. Islam Said, the suspect's son, and Yassim Said, the suspect's brother, both face charges for harbouring a fugitive. A murder investigation was opened on 1 January 2008 after Amina and Sarah were found shot to death. On that day, the suspect took Amina and Sarah for a ride in his taxicab, on the pretext of taking them for a meal, the FBI alleges. The FBI says he drove them to Irving, Texas, where he allegedly shot both girls inside the taxicab. They both died of multiple gunshot wounds. Yaser Abdel Said is alleged to have shot his daughters inside his taxicab on New Year's Day Before their deaths, a family member told police the suspect had allegedly threatened ""bodily harm"" against Sarah for going on a date with a non-Muslim,according to CBS News,external. The sisters' great aunt, Gail Gattrell, has described their deaths as so-called ""honour killings"". The killing of a member of a family who is perceived to have brought dishonour upon relatives is sometimes described as an ""honour killing"" - but critics argue it is an inappropriate way to describe such deaths. Irving Police Department conducted an investigation into the deaths of Amina and Sarah and, on 2 January, 2008, a capital murder multiple warrant was issued for Yaser Abdel Said's arrest. Since then, local detectives and the FBI ""have tirelessly pursued justice for Amina and Sarah"", Irving Police Department police chief Jeff Spivey said. On 21 August, 2008, a federal warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was issued by a district court in Texas. FBI agents continued to pursue the suspect and, after ""12 years of frustration and dead ends"", eventually captured him on Wednesday. Mr DeSarno said his capture and arrest ""bring us one step closer to justice for Amina and Sarah"". In a statement, the girls' family said the announcement of the suspect's arrest had ""brought tears of elation, and shouts of triumph for us last night"". The statement said the family was ""relieved to finally begin the chapter to justice"" after ""bright and promising lives were torn away"".

"Pret A Manger to cut a third of UK workforceThe sandwich chain will slash 3,000 jobs as part of a rescue plan for the business.Business","Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, as part of a plan to save the business. The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre. The chain has been hit as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market - has plunged in the pandemic. It had already said it would permanently close 30 of its stores earlier this summer. Boss Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to lose so many colleagues. ""Although we're now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret. ""We've managed to protect many jobs by making changes to the way we run our shops and the hours we ask team members to work. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again."" Pret a Manger to cut staff hours Upper Crust owner to cut up to 5,000 jobs Like other retailers, Pret was forced to close for several months during lockdown, but while restrictions have eased, its trading has remained subdued. It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours. The chain said its weekly sales were around Â£5.2m in August - about the level they were in August 2010, when the business was considerably smaller. However, it said a recovery was ""clearly under way"", with sales having grown by 7% each week since July. The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week. It is the latest hospitality company to announce cuts due to the impact of the pandemic. Upper Crust-owner SSP Group has said it will cut up to 5,000 jobs, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel at railway stations and airports. Pizza Express, Byron Burger and Frankie & Benny's owner, the Restaurant Group, have also announced large-scale store closures and job cuts. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

Major fire and diesel spill after train derailsThe two workers who were onboard the train have been accounted for and no injuries are reported.Wales,"This video can not be played Investigations begin into railway diesel spill at Llangennech A freight train carrying diesel has derailed and burst into flames, with fuel spilling into a nearby river. About 300 people were evacuated from their homes in Llangennech, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, during the ""major incident"" on Wednesday night. Natural Resources Wales said it was not safe to try and contain a diesel spill which had gone into the River Loughor. A driver and engineer, onboard the train, were not injured and are being supported, owners DB Cargo UK said. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver had noticed something was wrong with the train, which was travelling from Milford Haven. It then derailed and the fire started. The blaze, which was still burning Thursday evening, was reported at about 23:20 BST on Wednesday and police said it had been declared a ""major incident"" due to the ""initial risk of harm"" to people nearby. People living within 800m of the fire described seeing ""plumes of smoke"" and seeing flames from the tracks, when they were evacuated from their homes. They have since been allowed back. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it was carrying out a preliminary examination and gathering evidence. Louise Perkins says she saw a ""massive fire and black smoke"" British Transport Police and Natural Resources Wales said their priorities, once they are able to access the site, were the fire itself and making the scene safe, as well as the environmental issues resulting from the spill. Bill Kelly, from Network Rail, said damage to the infrastructure was significant and would be further assessed by teams ""when it is safe for us to do so"". ""In terms of services this will obviously impact the central Wales line... I don't have timescales just yet on when we're likely to get them running again,"" he added. ""We will be able to continue running freight services using diversionary routes."" Ioan Williams, from Natural Resources Wales, said ""a significant volume of diesel has been spilled... we can confirm there is diesel in the River Loughor itself."" Puma Energy confirmed the third party-operated train was carrying its fuel from Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, to Theale, near Reading, when three tanks caught fire. ""Our immediate priority is to work with the emergency services, Network Rail, environmental agencies and the train operator to ensure public safety is maintained and any possible environmental impacts are mitigated,"" a spokesman said. Puma Energy has not yet confirmed how much fuel the train was carrying, or how much caught fire. The site of the derailment is close to the Loughor Estuary, which is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation. The tankers are being monitored and cooled, the fire service say But Aneurin Cox, duty incident manager for Natural Resources Wales, said it was ""not currently safe"" for workers to get close enough to try and contain the spill while the fire was burning. ""Once it's safe to do so, we will work with our partners to fully assess the environmental impact and advise Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin,"" he said. ""We will also be keeping local angling and cockling groups informed of the latest situation."" The cockle beds in the Burry Inlet - worked by 35 licensed pickers - have been closed following the diesel spill. Robert Griffiths, secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association, said he had been contacted by fisheries officers following a meeting of a number of agencies which monitor the beds. Mr Griffiths said the extent of any diesel pollution was still being assessed and it was hoped the closure would last only a few days. Louise Perkins, who lives close to the railway line, said she grabbed some stuff and rushed from her home with her children, aged seven, 12 and 19, in the middle of the night. The 38-year-old was up late watching TV when she heard an enormous bang: ""There was this massive fire and black smoke. ""As we left it was just fire - you could see like balls of it puffing up, and the smell... the smell of diesel. ""It was just everywhere, and there were just black, black clouds of smoke in the air."" Emergency services had dealt with a ""fast-moving"" and ""large scale"" situation, police say Ms Perkins said she was ""quite worried"" when police explained ""it could explode"". ""At that point my children were up and and they got really distressed,"" she said. Her 19-year-old son went to his friend's house while her two younger children went to their grandmother's. ""They were worried - 'oh, what if our house catches fire, what about all the stuff?'"" she explained. ""I told them not to panic. But my youngest was really upset, she was just heartbroken, she was crying."" The fire started after a number of tanks of the train derailed One Twitter user said,externalthey could smell burning fuel from ""well over a mile away"". Councillor Gwyneth Thomas, a former A&E nurse, was at the scene to offer help if needed and said how ""hugely impressed"" she was by ""how calm"" the emergency service personnel were. ""Some carried young children and others took their dogs with them,"" she recalled. ""It's very fortunate that the accident didn't happen closer to Llangennech [railway] station where there are more homes, and evacuation of residents would have been more difficult."" Sandra Thomas says she was watching TV in bed when police came knocking at her door Sandra Thomas has lived on Pontarddulais Road since 1972 and said nothing like this had ever happened before and the fire went up ""like a bomb"". ""I was terrified - I'm shaking all over,"" she said, adding police knocked on her door while she was watching TV in bed. She was sent to the community centre, but was allowed to return home on Thursday morning. But Ms Thomas became concerned when she looked out of her window at 08:00 to see a large black plume of smoke. ""I don't feel 100% safe in case it sparks off again and the rest of the tankers go up,"" she added. Llangennech is near the Carmarthenshire-Swansea county border, in south-west Wales Speaking at a press conference just before midday, Supt Andy Morgan, of BTP, said: ""While this is an ongoing incident that may go on for some time, we are hugely thankful that no-one has been injured or anything more serious than that has happened here."" When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed.

Dutch masterpiece stolen for third time,"Security was stepped up the last time Frans Hals's painting Two Laughing Boys with a Mug of Beer was stolen from a small museum in the Dutch town of Leerdam. But it was not enough to stop art thieves forcing open the back door and making off with it for a third time. One of the Old Masters of the Dutch Golden Age, Frans Hals painted the work in 1626. Art detective Arthur Brand said he believed it was ""stolen to order"". ""It's very difficult to secure small museums as it costs too much money. If they want to have your stuff, they'll get in,"" he told the BBC. Two Laughing Boys was first stolen in 1988 along with a Jacob van Ruisdael work. Both paintings were recovered three years later. Art detective receives photos of 'stolen Van Gogh' Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Stolen Klimt mystery 'solved' by gardener in Italy 'Audacious' Rembrandt theft foiled at London gallery The same paintings were taken again from the Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden museum in 2011 and found six months on. Frans Hals specialist Anna Tummers said at the time the painting was a ""wonderful example of his loose painting style... it was very playful, daring and loose"". Police said thieves broke into the museum in Leerdam, south of Utrecht, in the early hours of Wednesday. The alarm went off at 03:30 but by the time they had got to the museum the thieves had gone. They are now scouring CCTV footage and working with art theft experts and forensic teams. Since the 2011 theft, the museum's most valuable pieces have been kept in an area not open to the public that can only be visited with a member of staff, Dutch media report. No-one at the museum was willing to comment about the latest theft. But Arthur Brand, an art detective specialising in recovering stolen works, said a theft of this sort had been expected. Criminals had been buying stolen works of art and exchanging them for shorter jail terms, he said. Examples include drug dealer Kees Houtman who tried to exchange Van Goghs for a reduced sentence in the early 1990s. A Naples mafia boss would later exchange worksstolen by art thief Octave Durham from Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum in 2002for his own shorter sentence. In March, a Van Gogh work, Spring Garden, was stolen from a museum in Laren, to the north of Utrecht, and it was thought there would be more thefts from museums without top security. The art detective also linked the latest theft to a recent breakthrough by Dutch and French police, who cracked a top-secret communications system used by criminals. That has enabled police to make progress on a number of criminal cases. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works The problem for the criminals, he said, was that the Dutch government would no longer buy stolen art. Smaller Dutch museums are not alone in being targeted by art thieves. The Dulwich Picture Gallery was targeted by an intruder last year Last November, an attempt to steal two Rembrandts was thwarted at Dulwich Picture Gallery in South London. An intruder broke into the gallery, but police intervened before the paintings could be taken away. Although Dutch authorities have a good track record in retrieving stolen art, works can often disappear for years. It took 23 years for a Gustav Klimt painting to be recovered, after it was seized from a modern art gallery in Piacenza, northern Italy. It was eventually found in a hole in the gallery wall by a worker who stumbled on a metal panel while clearing ivy from the wall.

Jameela Jamil says 'backlash' is media fabricationThe actress and activist says 90% of the messages she receives are of support or thanks.Entertainment & Arts,"Actress and activist Jameela Jamil says the media often exaggerates the volume of criticism she receives. The Good Place star regularly campaigns on issues of body image, race and feminism, occasionally attracting controversy on social media. ""Naturally, the thing that gets the most attention is when I experience 'the backlash,'"" she told the virtual Edinburgh TV Festival. ""So people think I'm just constantly [getting] backlash. That's not true. ""Honestly, if you even read the articles where it's like 'Jameela Jamil backlash', it's two tweets that... haven't even been sent to me, they're just about me, and they call that a backlash,"" she explained. ""I have 90% support, my inbox is full of thousands of positive messages of either support or thanks. ""So I do want women out there... to know that I'm not just batting away the patriarchy all the time, I am consistently living a rewarding and engaging and fulfilling life, in my pursuit of equality."" Jameela Jamil 'was too ethnic' for US 'Airbrushing should be illegal' - Jameela Jamil Jameela Jamil announces she is âqueerâ Media outlets sometimes sensationalise stories to drive clicks and advertising revenue, but Jamil suggested there could be another motive for highlighting criticism of her activism: to discourage other women from becoming too vocal. ""They want to terrify us about speaking out because, especially post-MeToo, we've seen the tremendous power of when women come together."" However, she acknowledged, her comments and actions sometimes do provoke a genuinely strong reaction. ""Sometimes thereisbacklash and you just have to make a decision,"" she said. ""If you are going to be someone who speaks out, you have to understand you're going to rub people up the wrong way, people who are on the opposition, as well as people on your own side, because there is a weird amount of competition in activism, that I don't understand."" This video can not be played Jameela Jamil on equal pay, #MeToo and body image ""And you have to protect yourself. I am someone who is incredibly lucky to have... a loving household that I live in with friends and a boyfriend, but also I have access to very good therapy. ""So if you're going to engage in this, make sure that you have built yourself a proper support system, because it is hard, but it isn't impossible and it's not as bad as they try to make it look."" Jamil, who first became famous in the UK as a presenter on T4, has gone on to become a successful radio presenter and actress, starring in the hit comedy series The Good Place. While she says the media exaggerates criticism of her activism, she has occasionally attracted significant criticism. Earlier this year, she was hired as a judge on the HBO's Legendary - a voguing competition celebrating the underground gay culture of ballroom, prompting complaints that she was not representative of the black LGBT community.

"Johnson hires personal trainer in bid to get fitThe prime minister has previously said he was ""too fat"" when he was hospitalised with coronavirus.UK Politics","Boris Johnson has hired personal trainer Harry Jameson to lose weight, after acknowledging he was ""too fat"" when he caught coronavirus. The prime minister was admitted to hospital with the virus in April but says he has since ""been steadily building up my fitness"". Mr Jameson says his training ""considers the mind as much as the body"". The coach has also helped Love Island host Laura Whitmore train and has a regular slot on her BBC radio show. Coronavirus prompts PM into obesity crackdown Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity How bad is our obesity problem? Mr Johnson's time in intensive care is thought to have prompted a change in his views on tackling obesity. He has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and characterised his stance as ""libertarian"". In July he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus,"" he said. As part of a drive to tackle the problem, the government said it would ban TV junk food adverts before 21:00. On a personal level, Mr Johnson has said he had ""wanted to lose weight for ages"" adding that he ""struggled"" to keep fat off. He said that since leaving hospital he had lost ""at least a stone"" by going for a run with the dog. Harry Jameson has previously worked with TV presenter and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Laura Whitmore (centre) Speaking to the BBC's Fit & Fearless podcast,the prime minister's new trainer, Mr Jameson, said he seeks to help his clients ""in ways beyond pumping weights in the gym"". He says his approach has ""always been based on a foundation of mind and body together and ultimately happiness"". He studied sports science and psychology at Liverpool Hope University and has worked as a personal trainer for 15 years.

Why Maguireâs Greek trial went so fast,"Greek justice threw the book at Harry Maguire, and fast. His international football career was put on hold after a court gave him a suspended jail term, for repeated bodily harm, attempted bribery, violence against public employees and insult after arrest on Mykonos. He has now appealed, and is now presumed innocent unless the appeal court finds him guilty. Partly because, in the eyes of Greek justice, he was ""caught red-handed"". ""In Greek criminal procedure there is a process known as ""in flagrante delicto"" and it applies to people caught in the act of committing an offence,"" says Athens lawyer Konstantinos Starantzis. In other words, in this sort of case it's totally normal. For up to 48 hours from the time of an alleged offence - until midnight the next day - police can arrest someone without a warrant. Then, after a preliminary investigation, the suspect must be brought before a public prosecutor, who will decide whether to indict or not. If there's an indictment, a trial must take place either the same day or the day after. In Greece, as anywhere else, resistance to arrest and violence towards police officers, if proven at court, is not easily tolerated. The Syros court was convinced that there was some sort of violence towards the policemen involved in the case for two reasons: The policemen would have had no legitimate or reasonable cause to persecute Maguire and his friends The officers presented evidence of their injuries In the eyes of the judges, Harry Maguire committed both offences, plus that of attempted bribery, so they simply handed him a relevant sentence. Booze brawls on popular Greek islands are a common occurrence during the summer. Greek authorities have no interest in either hurting the country's tourism or adding more cases to an already burdened justice system. The reason why this case made it to court was simply because it involved allegations of violence against policemen. Maguire's lack of apology 'shocking' Maguire given suspended sentence in Greece Maguire likely to remain Man Utd captain It appears both due process and the rule of law were followed. However, with regard to a request brought by Harry Maguire's defence for a postponement of the trial, the judges were not very lenient. Postponement, especially when a new legal team is hired by the defence, is common in Greek trials. It was not obligatory, though, and the judge was well within his remit to reject it. In some cases, judges decide to reject such requests for secondary reasons, for example to take advantage of witnesses present in the courtroom who might be absent if the trial takes place a year later, or simply to avoid legal tactics of procrastination. During this first stage of the legal process, and pending the footballer's appeal, his defence team failed to convince the judges. England defender Maguire, his brother Joe, and family friend Christopher Sharman denied the charges. The defence focused heavily on their account of how an initial fight started in the alleyways of Mykonos with a group of Albanians. Ioannis Paradissis, a lawyer for two of the policemen involved, said this was no defence for the charges for which Harry Maguire was accused. ""They have injuries and the three defendants say they are not guilty but... they don't explain how these injuries were made,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. Ahead of the verdict, the footballer's lawyer, Andreas Anagnostakis, said his client's conduct was justified because the policemen had allegedly attacked him in his ""golden leg"" and told him ""your career is over"". As it was based on Harry Maguire's words, the judges found this defence not proven in court. According to the prosecution, the attempted bribery charge involved Harry Maguire asking whether he could pay a fine to be released from police custody. His lawyer did not completely deny that, suggesting ""it could have been something that was lost in translation"". It is unclear how long that might take but it usually takes a year from the moment an appeal is lodged. But in Greece an appeal is in effect a retrial, according to Ioannis Paradissis. ""So obviously there is still time for the three defendants to say they are sorry and then I believe that the outcome might be different."" Maguire's club Manchester United have given a statement saying the player is not subject to any international travel restrictions As Maguire's club, Manchester United, point out, by lodging an appeal the verdict has been quashed, the conviction nullified and he has neither a criminal record nor is subject to any international travel restrictions. In the months before Harry Maguire's appeal, his defence team will face a decision whether to provide a more detailed explanation of his innocence or accept wrongdoing and apologise in exchange for the charges to be dropped.

Manhunt after father âabducts sons in foster careâ,"Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen Safi are said to have been taken from their foster home An urgent manhunt is under way for a father who abducted his three sons from their foster home, police have said. Imran Safi, 26, is said to have threatened a foster carer with a knife in Coulsdon, south London, last Thursday. He is accused of taking Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen - aged six, five and three. An image of Mr Safi has been circulated to all ports and borders amid concerns he may attempt to take the boys abroad. All three brothers were playing in the garden while their foster carer was inside the house on Coulsdon Road when they were taken, detectives said. The foster carer, who told officers that Safi threatened her with a knife, did not suffer any serious physical injuries but was ""understandably distressed"". It is understood that the boys were due to be formally adopted, a fact detectives believe could have been a motivation for the abduction. Mr Safi was not thought to have access to the boys' passports. Imran Safi is said to be in possession of a knife, the Met said Metropolitan Police Commander Jon Savell said the boys had ""been in social care services for some while"" and their natural family had become aware they were going to be adopted. He added that Mr Safi was not allowed to go to the foster carer's address and had ""taken the law into his own hands"" by doing so. Mr Savell said it was ""an absolute priority"" to find the three children and more than 100 officers were working to locate them. ""They have been taken from a place of safety and we are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, particularly as we remain in the midst of a global health crisis,"" he said. ""While we do not believe at this time there is any immediate risk to their physical safety, their location, access to accommodation, healthcare, and other provisions is entirely unknown."" ""We are concerned about the longer-term impact of this on all three children. ""An intense investigation into how this abduction was planned and carried out is being led by detectives in south London, alongside a manhunt being led by specialist detectives within the Met."" Eight people aged between 17 and 37 have been arrested in connection with the abduction. They were all arrested in Croydon and have been bailed to a later date, the Met said. A red Nissan Qashqai, with the registration PK13 WFO, is thought to have been involved in the abduction. Police are appealing for any dashcam footage which shows the car believed to be linked to Imran Safi By Home Affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Police are struggling with this case. The usual tactics of CCTV, automatic number plate cameras, and tracking mobile phone usage have not worked. The getaway car was found in the area. It is possible the father may have switched vehicles. The first thing they did was to inform airports and sea ports. Now they are worried an attempt will be made to smuggle the children abroad - a traumatic experience for such young boys. It may already have happened. Ch Supt Dave Stringer urged witnesses who knew about the children's whereabouts to come forward Mr Safi is an Afghan national and has links to Pakistan but police do not yet know if he has travelled overseas. Detectives are working closely with national and international agencies to ensure any movement into foreign countries is identified. Ch Supt Dave Stringer said that the incident would ""understandably send a shock"" to the local Croydon community. ""We know there are people with detailed knowledge of the whereabouts of these children, and we fully appreciate there may be very good reasons for those individuals not wanting to come forward,"" he said. ""But right now I would strongly urge them to do the right thing and assist us in locating them."" Croydon Council declined to comment due to the ""active police investigation"".

Daily UK coronavirus cases highest since mid-June,"The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in 24 hours - up from 1,048 on Wednesday - the highest tally since mid-June. This is still much lower than the 5,000 new cases a day in April, at the peak of the epidemic. Cases have been rising across Europeand began edging up again in the UK in July, after falling in June. A number of areas have seen a spike in infections, with Birmingham and Northampton the latest places affected. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? And experts suspect a relatively small number of areas in the UK are responsible for an increase in new cases. Testing has also increased over recent weeks and this means more people with the virus are being detected. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". However,NHS England's Test and Trace scheme,externalis still failing to actually hit its 80% target, with weekly figures showing the time taken to turn around results is getting longer. The last weekly testing of people in thousands of private households, by theOffice for National Statistics (ONS),external, seen as the most accurate picture of new infections, suggested cases were levelling off. New weekly ONS figures will be released on Friday. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, the numbers of people admitted to hospital and dying from Covid-19 are on a downward trend. As of Thursday, the government reported 41,477 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - a rise of 12 on the previous day. Separate figures published by the ONS show there have now been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. This rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now testing more then we did two months ago. The more you look for the virus, the more you will find. The increase we have seen since early July - when the average rate was half what it is now - cannot be all accounted for by more testing, but it is certainly a key factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic we could not do mass testing so we do not know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates are there were around 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to get down to zero. What is important now is that we keep beating down on the virus - and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions imposed on them in recent weeks are seeing a declining number of cases. The national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But there can be no room for complacency. In other news: Police in England and Wales have seen a 31% rise in assaults on emergency services workers in the four weeks to 2 August, compared to the same period last year. Martin Hewitt chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council said he was ""disgusted"" by the increase at a time when emergency services were on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic From Tuesday,workers on low incomesin parts of England where there are high rates of coronavirus will be able to claim up to Â£182 (equal to Â£13 a day) if they have to self-isolate. The benefit will be trialled in parts of north-west England first No new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. It comes after the first deaths following a positive test in the nation for six weeks wereannounced on Wednesday The take up of the flu jab among people in vulnerable groups has declined, according to BBC analysis, despite plans to double the number of people who receive it.

"Pret A Manger to cut a third of UK workforceThe sandwich chain will slash 3,000 jobs as part of a rescue plan for the business.","Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, as part of a plan to save the business. The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre. The chain has been hit as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market - has plunged in the pandemic. It had already said it would permanently close 30 of its stores earlier this summer. Boss Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to lose so many colleagues. ""Although we're now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret. ""We've managed to protect many jobs by making changes to the way we run our shops and the hours we ask team members to work. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again."" Pret a Manger to cut staff hours Upper Crust owner to cut up to 5,000 jobs Like other retailers, Pret was forced to close for several months during lockdown, but while restrictions have eased, its trading has remained subdued. It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours. The chain said its weekly sales were around Â£5.2m in August - about the level they were in August 2010, when the business was considerably smaller. However, it said a recovery was ""clearly under way"", with sales having grown by 7% each week since July. The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week. It is the latest hospitality company to announce cuts due to the impact of the pandemic. Upper Crust-owner SSP Group has said it will cut up to 5,000 jobs, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel at railway stations and airports. Pizza Express, Byron Burger and Frankie & Benny's owner, the Restaurant Group, have also announced large-scale store closures and job cuts. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

Where can I go on holiday?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Will I get my money back?,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

Was it worth going abroad?,"Queuing to get a socially-distanced sunbathing spot on the beach. Wearing your face mask to the hotel bar. Finding out halfway through your trip that you'll have to quarantine when you get home. People are going abroad for holidays for the first time in months, but as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, is it worth the hassle? Several plans have fallen through forGrace Wildingso far this summer. The 19-year-old trainee teacher had been looking forward to a big family holiday in a villa in Spain, but they postponed the trip for fears her baby nephew could catch the virus. Grace and her boyfriendAlfie Archer, 18, had also booked a trip to Cape Verde, but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. The couple didn't want to lose the opportunity to soak up some sun on their first summer holiday together, and they felt that the virus posed a low risk to them as young and healthy people - so they began hunting for a last-minute deal. ""I'd say I feel safer here than home definitely. The same rules are applied but everyone actually follows them here,"" says Grace from her hotel in Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. The Liverpool Hope University student from Halton, Cheshire, says she was glad to hear flight attendants reminding people to wear face masks on the plane, and that she waited patiently in line for temperature checks at the airport in Tenerife, and happily shared her details with local contact tracers. In Grace and Alfie's hotel, everyone wears face coverings at all times until they reach their rooms, sun loungers, or dinner tables. ""Wearing the masks in the heat can be a bit of a nuisance at times, but this is the climate we've decided to put ourselves in so we will abide by the rules like everyone else,"" she says. Grace Wilding says everyone's following coronavirus rules at her hotel in Playa de las Americas In restaurants ""you're greeted with hand sanitiser before you sit down"", she says. And the couple has mostly steered clear of going to the beach, where officials make people queue up to get a sunbathing spot that's a safe distance from other holidaymakers. In keeping with the theme of the summer so far, more of Grace's plans were scuppered whenthe UK's quarantine rules changed for Spain- including the Canary Islands - while they were away. Grace and Alfie are now having to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to the UK. Where can I go on holiday and what are the restrictions? What are my holiday travel and insurance rights? Spain quarantine: 'We found out three minutes after landing' Grace admits the couple wouldn't have gone to Tenerife if they had known they would have to quarantine when they came back. Alfie worries about the two weeks of income he will lose, because he is a joiner so cannot work while isolating. But Grace remains upbeat. She says the news meant they enjoyed the holiday ""probably even more"" as they made the most of their last days of relative freedom before flying home. ""I wouldn't hold back on booking another holiday,"" Grace adds. ""The world can't stop for any longer, in my opinion."" AsBen Osbornedescribes his family holiday over the phone, his voice is partly drowned out by the sound of his sons shouting and playing at their rented apartment in Lake Como, Italy. ""They're having a fantastic time,"" he laughs. The family of five, from Hereford, have been to water parks, on day trips, and spent a lot of time at the pool they share with others in the apartment block. Ben, who works for Vodafone as a customer solutions architect, says the pandemic hasn't got in the way of their holiday at all. They've even taken a mini-break from social distancing. Ben, 39, and his wife Nadia, 37, decided they wouldn't be too strict on their children adhering to Italy's one-metre rule during the 11-day holiday, so they have mixed with other young families staying in the complex. Ben says this doesn't mean they have completely given up on social distancing and the adults are remaining wary around each other. But he says three-year-old Cooper has ""absolutely no concept of staying away from people"" and so the rules have also been relaxed for his older brothers Ashton, 10, and Carter, eight. The Osbornes found Lake Como to be much quieter than on their previous trips Hygiene rules such as mandatory swimming caps didn't stop Ashton and Carter enjoying the pool The only time the pandemic brought the mood down was during the Osbornes' journey to their idyllic destination. The worst part was navigating the not-so-idyllic Luton Airport, which Ben describes as a ""nightmare"". He recalls only one shop was open - Boots - and that it was difficult to find any empty seats in the airport because so many were cordoned off. But the flight itself ""wasn't too bad"", he says. The family wore face coverings but did have to sit next to strangers, without any social distancing. The Osbornes have been to Lake Como before, and are enjoying the fact there are far fewer Brits than usual. ""We quite like to go away to experience different cultures, [so] what's really nice is I've not heard any English language,"" Ben says. He adds that it's a blessing to not have to queue for the supermarket, as we have grown used to in the UK. The only visible signs of the virus, to Ben, were people wearing face coverings in shops, and mandatory swimming caps in the pool. ""If someone had plonked us here and we didn't know about coronavirus, we wouldn't know the difference. You honestly wouldn't know that there's a pandemic."" Julie Grinter's friends told her she was ""completely mad"" for deciding to go ahead with her three-week holiday to Portugal, after the country failed to make it on to the UK government's quarantine-free list. But Julie, 50, points out that you could catch coronavirus in the supermarket at home, let alone on a plane. ""You can't stay inside for the rest of your life so you've got to take the precautions and get on with life,"" she says. The choice of destination might have horrified Julie's friends, but she and her partner Matthew Boulden, 52, felt extremely safe. After flying to Lisbon they went on a road trip to the Algarve and enjoyed being almost the only tourists, wherever they went. ""It's just absolutely deserted. There's just nobody there,"" says Julie, who works for a consultancy firm in the City of London. The couple ate out regularly, and while most dining was outside to help reduce the spread of the virus, Julie points out that the Portuguese climate meant that was never a problem. Impeccable service, high hygiene standards, free drinks from grateful waiters, and chats with less-than-busy chefs all added to the couple's feeling that they'd stumbled into a luxurious private dining experience. Restaurants owners on Julie's road trip told her they were struggling with a lack of customers Julie, who says many beaches were deserted, took this photo of the popular Praia da Rainha in Cascais Crowds at Praia da Rainha in Cascais, in the pre-coronavirus world of August 2016 But Julie from Surbiton, south-west London, admits the solitude wasn't always a relief. Tourism is a major industry in Portugal and is popular with British holidaymakers, with almost three million UK visitors a year. The restaurants often lacked ""a bit of atmosphere"", she says, adding that the staff were anxious for the future, and owners were ""hacked off"" and ""obviously devastated"" that their countrystill has not made it on to the UK's quarantine-free lists. ""You do feel massively sorry for them because they are just desperate for business,"" she says. Portugal's border is open to British citizens, but the UK government advisesagainst travel to most parts unless the trip is essential,external. On arrival to the mainland, travellers have to do a health screening, and those going to Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores must take a coronavirus test on arrival or before travelling. Cheap flights, deserted beaches and a free cocktail or two mean now that Julie is home, she's spending her 14 days of isolation persuading her previously horrified friends that Portugal is the place to be in a pandemic. ""If you can just work from home when you get back, it's ideal."" ForAdam Welch, a self-imposed month of minimal social contact at home in Kirkham, Lancashire, is the price he's paying for a five-night getaway to Croatia. The 18-year-old and three friends have formed a temporary household bubble at an Airbnb in Split. In order to reduce the chance of spreading the virus to one another, or to anyone else on their return to the UK, the friends agreed to minimise their social contact with anyone for 14 days before going away and 14 days after getting back. ""I just think it comes down to thinking of other people,"" Adam says. The pandemic led to exams and celebrations being cancelled in Adam's final year of college, so the sacrifice of semi-quarantine will be worth it to ""let my hair down"" on holiday, he says. ""If someone said to me at the start of the year, 'if you go on holiday you have to isolate for 14 days afterwards in your house', I'd be like: 'no way. I can't do that, it sounds so hard'. But now it just sounds easy."" So far in Split, the four friends have enjoyed eating out, going out for drinks, exploring the city, and snorkelling off picture-perfect beaches. People have to wear masks in shops and on public transport in Croatia but locals aren't observing social distancing at all, Adam says. While it's weird to see, he adds, it's a nice break from the rules and regulations in place in the UK. Adam Welch says he's happy to give up Croatia's nightclubs in favour of its beaches In the hiatus between finishing college and starting university in York in September, Adam admits he's tempted by Croatia's nightclubs, which are open albeit with some additional cleaning measures to combat the spread of the virus. But Adam says the ""lads' holiday"" will be a more muted affair than it would have been in normal times. ""At the end of the day, we're in a nice apartment, we can just get some drinks from a shop and stuff like that, and chill out with each other. We can definitely have a really good time and we don't have to go clubbing.""

French hunters must stop using glue to trap birds,"French hunters go after thrushes - but other species get stuck in the glue too French President Emmanuel Macron has ordered hunters in southern France to stop the controversial practice of trapping birds on glue-covered twigs. The suspension follows a warning to France from the European Commission that it could face legal action at EU level if the practice continued. France is unusual in Europe for still tolerating the glue method, used to catch thrushes and blackbirds. The hunting method is limited to five regions around Marseille and Nice. President Macron's decision came when he and Minister for Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili met the head of the French hunting lobby, Willy Schraen, at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace in Paris on Wednesday. It is a suspension of the practice for this year, pending a legal opinion from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the issue. Conservationists say the glue method is non-selective and cruel, harming not only songbirds but also other birds such as robins and tits. In July the European Commission - which enforces EU law - gave France three months to address its concerns, warning that failure to comply with the EU's 2009 Birds Directive could mean a case at the ECJ. TheCommission warning,externalsaid France ""has authorised several methods for the capture of birds, such as glue for thrushes, nets and traps for skylark and pigeons, which are not selective and are forbidden by the Directive. ""Member States may derogate from certain provisions of the Directive but only under strict conditions that are not fulfilled in this case, especially because most of the species captured are not in a good conservation status."" The Commission says at least 32% of the EU's bird species are currently not in a good conservation status and in France, among the 64 species that can be hunted, only 20 are in good conservation status.

The EU average is 30 species, making France the most forgiving country for hunters."" Thierry Coste of the National Federation of Hunters (FNC) told the Euractiv news website that the hunters' methods were already strictly supervised. ""Hunters capture thrushes for their birdsongs,"" he said. ""They observe strict rules, such as specific hours of day, releasing other birds and cleaning them.""

Jameela Jamil says 'backlash' is media fabrication,"Actress and activist Jameela Jamil says the media often exaggerates the volume of criticism she receives. The Good Place star regularly campaigns on issues of body image, race and feminism, occasionally attracting controversy on social media. ""Naturally, the thing that gets the most attention is when I experience 'the backlash,'"" she told the virtual Edinburgh TV Festival. ""So people think I'm just constantly [getting] backlash. That's not true. ""Honestly, if you even read the articles where it's like 'Jameela Jamil backlash', it's two tweets that... haven't even been sent to me, they're just about me, and they call that a backlash,"" she explained. ""I have 90% support, my inbox is full of thousands of positive messages of either support or thanks. ""So I do want women out there... to know that I'm not just batting away the patriarchy all the time, I am consistently living a rewarding and engaging and fulfilling life, in my pursuit of equality."" Jameela Jamil 'was too ethnic' for US 'Airbrushing should be illegal' - Jameela Jamil Jameela Jamil announces she is âqueerâ Media outlets sometimes sensationalise stories to drive clicks and advertising revenue, but Jamil suggested there could be another motive for highlighting criticism of her activism: to discourage other women from becoming too vocal. ""They want to terrify us about speaking out because, especially post-MeToo, we've seen the tremendous power of when women come together."" However, she acknowledged, her comments and actions sometimes do provoke a genuinely strong reaction. ""Sometimes thereisbacklash and you just have to make a decision,"" she said. ""If you are going to be someone who speaks out, you have to understand you're going to rub people up the wrong way, people who are on the opposition, as well as people on your own side, because there is a weird amount of competition in activism, that I don't understand."" This video can not be played Jameela Jamil on equal pay, #MeToo and body image ""And you have to protect yourself. I am someone who is incredibly lucky to have... a loving household that I live in with friends and a boyfriend, but also I have access to very good therapy. ""So if you're going to engage in this, make sure that you have built yourself a proper support system, because it is hard, but it isn't impossible and it's not as bad as they try to make it look."" Jamil, who first became famous in the UK as a presenter on T4, has gone on to become a successful radio presenter and actress, starring in the hit comedy series The Good Place. While she says the media exaggerates criticism of her activism, she has occasionally attracted significant criticism. Earlier this year, she was hired as a judge on the HBO's Legendary - a voguing competition celebrating the underground gay culture of ballroom, prompting complaints that she was not representative of the black LGBT community.

Johnson hires personal trainer in bid to get fit,"Boris Johnson has hired personal trainer Harry Jameson to lose weight, after acknowledging he was ""too fat"" when he caught coronavirus. The prime minister was admitted to hospital with the virus in April but says he has since ""been steadily building up my fitness"". Mr Jameson says his training ""considers the mind as much as the body"". The coach has also helped Love Island host Laura Whitmore train and has a regular slot on her BBC radio show. Coronavirus prompts PM into obesity crackdown Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity How bad is our obesity problem? Mr Johnson's time in intensive care is thought to have prompted a change in his views on tackling obesity. He has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and characterised his stance as ""libertarian"". In July he said that while he was not normally one for ""nannying or bossying"", the country did need to lose weight to protect from a second spike. ""Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus,"" he said. As part of a drive to tackle the problem, the government said it would ban TV junk food adverts before 21:00. On a personal level, Mr Johnson has said he had ""wanted to lose weight for ages"" adding that he ""struggled"" to keep fat off. He said that since leaving hospital he had lost ""at least a stone"" by going for a run with the dog. Harry Jameson has previously worked with TV presenter and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Laura Whitmore (centre) Speaking to the BBC's Fit & Fearless podcast,the prime minister's new trainer, Mr Jameson, said he seeks to help his clients ""in ways beyond pumping weights in the gym"". He says his approach has ""always been based on a foundation of mind and body together and ultimately happiness"". He studied sports science and psychology at Liverpool Hope University and has worked as a personal trainer for 15 years. Like the prime minister, Mr Jameson also appears to be a fan of the classics having quoted the Roman philosopher Seneca (""as long as you live, keep learning how to live"") in a speech to the Balance Festival in 2018.

Pret A Manger to cut a third of UK workforce,"Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, as part of a plan to save the business. The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre. The chain has been hit as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market - has plunged in the pandemic. It had already said it would permanently close 30 of its stores earlier this summer. Boss Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to lose so many colleagues. ""Although we're now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret. ""We've managed to protect many jobs by making changes to the way we run our shops and the hours we ask team members to work. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again."" Pret a Manger to cut staff hours Upper Crust owner to cut up to 5,000 jobs Like other retailers, Pret was forced to close for several months during lockdown, but while restrictions have eased, its trading has remained subdued. It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours. The chain said its weekly sales were around Â£5.2m in August - about the level they were in August 2010, when the business was considerably smaller. However, it said a recovery was ""clearly under way"", with sales having grown by 7% each week since July. The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week. It is the latest hospitality company to announce cuts due to the impact of the pandemic. Upper Crust-owner SSP Group has said it will cut up to 5,000 jobs, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel at railway stations and airports. Pizza Express, Byron Burger and Frankie & Benny's owner, the Restaurant Group, have also announced large-scale store closures and job cuts. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

ITV confirms I'm A Celeb's move to Welsh castle,"The castle near Abergele was built in the early 19th Century The next series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! will be filmed at Gwrych Castle in north Wales, ITV has confirmed. The long-running reality show has had to relocate from Australia this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Ant and Dec will return as hosts, and the winner will be crowned the King or Queen of the Castle (instead of the Jungle). The celebrities taking part in the 2020 series have yet to be announced. ITV's director of television, Kevin Lygo, said the majority of the contestants had been booked before the relocation, raising fears they might pull out. ""We were worried they thought they were going to hot sunny bug-infested Australia, and now they are going to north Wales in the dark, but everyone is still there and excited,"" he told the Edinburgh TV festival. ""I think it will be fascinating to see and to have this reboot of a treasured brand forced upon us, I think, is a good thing."" Gwrych Castle,external, meaning ""Hedge Castle"" in Welsh, was built on the site of a late medieval fortress near Abergele, on the north coast of Wales, between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych. During World War Two, it was used by the government to house 200 Jewish children who had fled the Nazis in Europe; and later became a training ground for boxer Randy Turpin, ahead of his title fight with Sugar Ray Johnson. 'I'm A Celebrity... get me out of Conwy?' Set amongst 250 acres of gardens and grounds, it overlooks the Irish Sea and was described by Mr Lygo as ""a beautiful Walt Disney castle"" that is both ""crumbling"" and ""tough"". ITV confirmed it was moving I'm A Celebrity... to the UK earlier this month, but the exact location was not confirmed until Thursday. ""Our celebrities will probably have to swap shorts for thermals,"" said ITV Studios' director of entertainment Richard Cowles, ""but they can still look forward to a basic diet of rice and beans and plenty of thrills and surprises along the way."" Ant (left) and Dec will be hosting the 20th series from north Wales Dr Mark Baker, Chair of the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust said he was ""absolutely delighted"" that ITV had chosen the historic building as a location. ""I'm A Celebrity being here will really help support Gwrych Castle and its ongoing restoration as well as giving the region a much-needed economic boost,"" he said. Lord Elis-Thomas, The Welsh Government Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism said: ""We're extremely pleased to welcome such a large production to Wales, offering a chance to showcase a spectacular part of our country to significant audiences across the UK."" I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here is one of ITV's most popular shows and sees famous contestants face tough trials and challenges to win food and treats for their camp. It has been broadcast on ITV since 2002, when Tony Blackburn was crowned the first King of the Jungle. The 2019 launch show was ITV's most-watched programme of the year, seen by more than 13 million people. That made it the UK's most popular reality show, with more viewers than the top-rated episodes of Strictly Come Dancing, Britain's Got Talent and The Great British Bake Off last year. Given the show's popularity, and the decline in advertising revenues during the lockdown, Lygo, said he ""certainly didn't want a year without I'm A Celebrity"".

Retirement loan 'will cost us our family home',"Eddie Gray (left) with his grandson Christopher Croal Eddie Gray and his wife Lilian took out a loan from the Bank of Scotland more than 20 years ago to help fund their retirement. The Edinburgh couple, who were then in their 60s, wanted to supplement their state pensions, and thought the shared appreciation mortgage was a tempting opportunity. They borrowed Â£19,500, secured against their house in the Buckstone area of the city. The cash was interest-free and did not need to be repaid until they either both died or sold their home. But their family have been left ""appalled and disgusted"" after discovering that the cost of repaying the loan could be more than Â£200,000. The Bank of Scotland said it no longer offered this type of financial product and was happy to talk to the family about the situation. Under the terms of the loan, the bank receives 75% of any increase in the price of the house. When Eddie and Lilian took out the mortgage in 1997, their semi-detached home - which they bought in 1964 - was valued at Â£78,000. Lilian and Eddie Gray around the time when they took out the loan Lilian died two years later, but retired car salesman Eddie is still living in the house. It is now worth Â£320,000, which means the Bank of Scotland would be entitled to about Â£201,000 - the original loan, plus three quarters of the property's increased value. Eddie, who is now aged 90 and has dementia, is looked after by his two children, Elaine and Kenneth. His grandson, Christopher Croal, 32, from Penicuik in Midlothian, said the family had been ""devastated"" when they learned about the cost of the loan. He said: ""When something happens to my grandfather we are going to lose the family home because of this horrendous situation. ""He owned his home outright, but now because of this ruthless product we have been left in this terrible nightmare. ""My mum has fond memories of growing up in this house and now it is in tatters."" Christopher Croal said the loan meant they would lose their family home when his grandfather died or moved into a care home Thousands of people took out similar loans across the UK. Legal challenges have been mounted in a bid to reduce the charges, but none of the cases has yet reached a conclusion. Mr Croal said escalating legal fees had stopped his family pursuing their case. He added: ""We have been left appalled and disgusted by this deal and couldn't believe it when we found out."" A Bank of Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We no longer offer shared appreciation mortgages. ""We encourage customers who have taken these products and are now facing difficulty to contact us to see what options may be available to support them. ""We are very happy to talk to Mr Gray and his family to understand more about this case.""

Walmart to join Microsoft in bid for TikTok,"The US retail giant Walmart has said it will team up with Microsoft to make a bid for the US operations of TikTok. Walmart told the BBC it thought a deal with the Chinese video-sharing app would help it expand its operations. TikTok has been given 90 days to sell its US arm to an American firm or face a ban in the country. Donald Trump has alleged it shares its user data with Beijing - claims it denies. Earlier on Thursday the firm's boss resigned ahead of the impending ban. Confirming that the company was pursuing a deal, a Walmart spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators."" Microsoft, which confirmed at the beginning of August that it was in talks with TikTok, told the BBC it had ""nothing to share at this time"". With Walmart, which owns UK supermarket chain Asda, it will now go up against other prospective bidders, including the US tech giant Oracle. TikTok boss quits as Trump's ban looms TikTok founder defends potential Microsoft sale According to reports, TikTok's US operations could fetch as much as $30bn (Â£22bn) if a deal is reached. Since its global launch at the end of 2018 Tiktok has attracted a huge following, especially amongst the under-25s. The app lets its followers create short videos, with the help of an extensive database of songs and wide range of filters. However, the Trump administration has accused its owner, the Chinese internet firm Bytedance, of being a threat to US national security. It says the data the company collects from its 800 million users - 100 million of whom are reported to be in the US - is at risk of exploitation by the Chinese government. India's government has also banned TikTok, along with dozens more Chinese-made apps, claiming they ""surreptitiously"" transmit users' data. Beijing has denied such claims, calling the US ban politically motivated. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, has faced criticism for his decision to sell to a US company. But in a letter to his Chinese staff he said it was the only way to prevent the app from being taken down in America. It's not the only Chinese-owned app to attract the suspicion of the US authorities - the messaging app WeChat also faces a ban.

LiveLiveTrump to attack Biden and speak about unrest7 minutes ago,"Donald Trump formally accepts the Republican nomination to run for president in the 3 November US election Speaking at the White House, Trump presents himself as the law and order candidate, and laying into Democratic challenger Joe Biden Critics question whether the president should have used the White House for partisan political campaigning during his party convention The speech came amid simmering tension over police shootings and racism Trump talked about the unrest in American cities, including Kenosha, Minneapolis, and Chicago, but did not mention Jacob Blake's shooting His speech closed out the Republican convention, and heralded intense campaigning ahead of the election Edited by Matthew Davis Thank you for joining our coverage of the final night of the Republican convention, where Donald Trump gave a major speech as he accepted the party's nomination to run for a second term as president. Some of tonight's major moments: Live reporting by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Anthony Zurcher, Holly Honderich, Max Matza, Sam Cabral, Robin Levinson-King, Marianna Brady, Josh Cheetham, Ben Bevington and Tom Geoghegan. Donald Trump is known for his at-times-bombastic speeches. But during his address at the Republican convention, the president seemed surprisingly low-key. On Twitter, the hashtag #lowenergydonald was one of the top trends of the night, with people accusing him of rambling through his 70-minute keynote. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump is famously attuned to his own ratings. So what did the press make of his big speech? The New York Times notes Trump's warning on Biden (he mentioned his rival 42 times by name tonight), a theme echoed by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post, too, noted the Biden-bashing and the broader attacks on Democratic leaders across the country. Fox News online is fairly measured, focusing on Trump's law and order message, which was a theme we have seen repeated throughout the four days of the Republican convention. Phillip Robinson, 50, Independent -âA speech is there to provoke an emotional response to a candidate and sadly I lack emotion. A lot of what was said was not the whole truth, and a lot of fear-mongering. It created a narrative. The speech was powerful. The end of the speech was brilliant. But I have not been swayed by it. If I had to vote today, I would vote for Joe Biden only because I am really tired of hearing the president say things that are not the truth or not the whole truth. I would have to vote for anyone who tells the truth.â Cat Lewis, 56, Republican -âIt met all my criteria I wanted in an acceptance speech. The base is going to feel really good about it â to go vote and to take five people to the polls with them. It did what it was supposed to do."" Miriam Weinraub, 19, Democrat -âI agree this speech was for the base. My bar for his ability to stick with the script is very low, so he did well. I have a lot of problems with the lies. It was very repetitive and rambling. Here is the Republican Party, here are our beliefs and nobody else is rightâ¦ I wanted to hear more, as a young voter, about being a united country, rather than right or left.â Gabriel Montalvo, 21, Republican -âThe speech was for the Republican base that knows theyâre gonna be voting for him. He hit what I, and I'm sure others, believe are key points. He hit those points that I think many people want to hear his thoughts and opinions on, then looped back to his accomplishments. Itâs very important for me, as a Hispanic American, to hear him talk about the differences between right and left.â By Adam Gingrich, political consultant and former Trump campaign operative. Hurricanes, wildfires, a pandemic and urban riots. You might think Americans were having a bad week. Donald Trump has a different view. Tonight, Trump was the first president since Franklin Roosevelt to accept his partyâs nomination from the White House. While not unprecedented, itâs certainly a new optic for the American voters. But, then again, in 2020, what isnât? Trump used his prime time spot to illustrate his strengths, capitalise on good economic news, and spoke with grave sincerity about the damage that Covid-19 has wrought upon our nation. He eloquently contrasted his record of achievement in one term with Bidenâs 47 years in DC, and he did it effectively. But in my opinion, the president was overshadowed by the incredibly emotional prior speeches by the widow of slain Captain David Dorn, the parents of Kayla Mueller and the face of Trumpâs âFirst Step Act,â Alice Marie Johnson. As Trump reinforced his message tonight, he stood little chance of eclipsing the night that unfurled before him. Overall, the night was an emphatic and emotional win, not just for Trump, but for all Americans. A win tonight for Trump, but above all: a win for the Republican ticket nationwide. The year 2020 is a year of chaos. Well, year 2020, meet the man who was born to lead in this environment; and that man is not Joe Biden. Thatâs what we learned tonight. Deanna Lusk, a 37-year-old legal assistant in Derby, Kansas, has just given us her reaction to Trump's acceptance speech. âI really like the fact that he spoke about Alice Johnson regarding the justice reform thatâs affecting a lot of Americans,â she tells BBC News, referring to the woman who spent 22 years in prison, had her sentence commuted by Trump and spoke tonight. âHe said America is the torch that lights the rest of the world I thought that was pretty accurate,â Lusk continues. On Covid-19, Lusk says Trump ""has more of a detailed plan for the country moving forward, given everything that weâve been through this past yearâ compared to Democrat Joe Biden. âI think he has more of a direction. Biden may have a plan but nobody really knows what thatâs going to be - what that entails. [Trump] comes across as more organised about what needs to happen.â She says she is planning to vote for Trump in November. Brooke Riske says that Trump has her vote this November Brooke Riske is a 34-year-old mother and an independent voter from Roanoke, Virginia. Up until recently, she has felt disengaged from politics, and voted for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson in 2016. This year, however, she will cast her vote for Trump's re-election. ""Cancel culture... that's what drew me to Trump,"" Riske says, just after watching the president's speech. ""It doesn't even feel like America anymore, it feels like we have to walk on egg shells."" Riske says she liked Trump's performance tonight. ""I wasn't blown away, but I didn't see any yellow or red flags,"" she says. ""I feel affirmed in my vote."" And Trump's uncharacteristically level delivery appealed: ""I felt like he was very even keeled compared to how he can be at times,"" she says. Now, Riske is looking forward to November's election. ""I'm really hopeful that some of this negativity will dissipate,"" she says. ""I'm ready to close the election chapter and just get back to living.""   Reality Check Mr Trump criticised Joe Bidenâs tax plan which he said would hit American families. âHe has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets.â Trump is correct that the Biden plan would lead to $4 trillion in revenues â over the next decade - according to analysis by the Tax Policy Centre. However, the claim is misleading as the taxes would target the wealthiest Americans - not âalmost all familiesâ. The Tax Policy Centre found that 93% of the tax increases would be paid by taxpayers in the top fifth of households. The high earners would see âsubstantially larger tax increases than households in other income groups, both in dollar amounts and as share of their incomes.â Joe Biden has also told ABC News that he would not raise taxes for anyone making under $400,000 a year. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter In a ponderous, hour-long speech
more akin to a State of the Union address than a nomination acceptance, Donald
Trump alternated between ticking through his record as president and circling
around, like a prize fighter, to launch strikes on his Democratic opponent, Joe
Biden. It was a
blunderbuss of attacks, of varying levels of validity, in the hope that some
will draw blood â on trade, immigration, education, energy and foreign policy.
But most of all, Trump sought to paint Biden as in league with the protesters
on the streets and the more left-wing members of the Democratic Party. âBiden
is a Trojan horse for socialism,â Trump said. âIf Joe Biden doesn't have the
strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow
radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you?â The
presidentâs speech ended with a laundry list of promises for his second-term
goals. âThis is
the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together,â he said. The setting of the speech was
majestic â on the grounds of the White House and in view of the Washington
monument. The delivery from a president who
thrives more on rousing rallies than rhetorical set-pieces, however, frequently
landed with a thud. Trump has now laid out a laundry list of second term promises, pledging to put a woman on the moon and a US flag on Mars, winning the race to develop 5G technology and creating a ""unifying national agenda that will bring our country together"". He's taken numerous shots at his challenger, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat is on the side of radical socialist mobs and the elite political class, and that he is owned by the Chinese communist government. This speech has laid out the clearest contrast between him and Biden, who promised last week to restore American ""dignity"" with Trump out of the White House. Ending his speech he declares: ""Together, we are unstoppable. ""Together, we are unbeatable. Because
together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America ""And on November
3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make
America prouder, and we will make America greater than ever before."" A huge firework display around the Washington Monument caps the end of one of the longest acceptance speeches in US political convention history. Trump's children applaud him as he speaks Images from the convention tonight show social distancing isn't being practiced by crowds of Trump supporters seated outside the White House. It's not gone unnoticed by Kamala Harris - the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Clockwise from top left: Phillip Robinson, Cat Lewis, Miriam Weinraub and Gabriel Montalvo Tonight, Trump has talked about Covid-19 - ""the silent enemy"" - which he frequently calls the ""China virus"". How American voters think he handled the US outbreak will surely be on their minds when they cast their ballot in November. Here's what some are thinking tonight: Phillip Robinson, 50, Independent -âLabeling a virus by a group of people is by definition racist... The economy cannot dictate the response to this virusâ¦ We have no choice but to hide.â Cat Lewis, 56, Republican -âI live in North Carolina and weâre in Phase Two, so thereâs a lot of our state that is shut down right now. This virus is destroying the economy. We have to open up. We have a lot of people out of work. More shutdowns will not work.â Miriam Weinraub, 19, DemocratââI find it surprising how he talked about the pandemic because theyâve barely discussed the coronavirus throughout this convention. Iâd rather have a struggling economy than people dying. It is incredibly disheartening to hear how the economy is more important than America citizens.â (Miriam has lost family members to the illness) Gabriel Montalvo, 21, RepublicanââI am from Queens, New York, the epicentre of the virus. We are moving past it and states are starting to open up... Kamala Harris blamed the Chinese government, too, earlier today. Both sides of the political aisle can agree that this started in one place: Communist China."" Reality Check Trump has been defending his governmentâs record in tackling the coronavirus pandemic at the Republican National Convention. He said âthe United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world"". This is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases measuring the number of death per positive tests of coronavirus. Itâs true this figure is relatively low for the US compared with most major European countries, including the UK. However, the numbers in Norway, Japan, and South Korea are all lower than the US though. Moreover, different countries are testing to find coronavirus cases in different ways, meaning the statistic is a hard comparison to make. A low case fatality rate could mean that widespread testing identifies lots of mild cases who were unlikely to die in the first place. You can read more about the US record on tackling Covid-19 here. Trump has just addressed the protests against racism and police brutality that have swept the nation since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. He says that the majority of police officers are good, but adds: ""When there is police
misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely
accountable, and it will."" ""But
what we can never have in America â and must never allow â is mob rule. In the
strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting,
arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha,
Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York."" He says Democrats are on the side of violent protesters, and have allowed anarchy on the streets of US cities. However, he never once mentioned Jacob Blake, the black man who was shot seven times in the back by a police officer on Sunday, spurring the latest protests in Kenosha. Reality Check The president claimed the United States had âobliterated 100 percent of the Isis Caliphateâ. Itâs true the Islamic State groupâs territory - a âcaliphateâ declared in 2014 - came to an end during the Trump era. The US-led alliance overran the group's last stronghold in Syria in March 2019. But as the BBC reported at the time, âdespite the demise of its physical caliphate, IS remains a battle-hardened and well-disciplined force whose 'enduring defeat' is not assured.â On 12 August a senior US military official laid out what was still needed,externalfor an enduring defeat against Isis, noting the group still poses a threat. Nominating conservative judges was a big campaign promise for Trump in 2016, and he's taking about it tonight - the selection of ""two great new Supreme Court Justices"". And that he did: With two appointments already in the president's first term, the bench's ideological balance tilts right, favouring conservatives in a 5-4 split. The court is now called the most conservative-leaning court in modern US history. But how have the justices issued their decisions? The BBC's Anthony Zurcher takes a look at the last Supreme Court term, to see if this conservative-leaning court actually votes that way. Clockwise from top left: Miriam Weinraub, Gabriel Montalvo, Phillip Robinson, Cat Lewis Trump is going through a laundry list of his first-term accomplishments, telling voters he can do more with another four years. But do voters agree? Here's what our voter panel told us: Cat Lewis, 56, Republicanâ""He has kept his promises. Built the wall, healthcare, the trade agreements with China, getting out of Nafta. Some of the things he promised on the campaign trail, he came through.â Miriam Weinraub, 19, Democratâ""A lot of the promises - he hasn't done them in the way he said"",she says, citing his failure to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, RepublicanââI certainly think President Trump has kept his promises. He has worked on immigration reform. He has built the economy. We have had justice reform, which had not been touched. He has made us energy independent.â Katty KayWorld News America presenter The choice of the White House as a venue for a party convention speech might have been controversial, but Trump is not making any apologies for it. And the stagecraft is stunning. Trump usually prefers to speak without a prompter â heâs sticking to it tonight but itâs certainly not his strength. His attacks just donât land as hard when delivered like this. The speech doesnât have same energy as when he just riffs at a rally. This increasingly feels like a State of the Union Address  - with a laundry list of achievements - rather than a campaign speech. Iâm willing to bet this speech (so far) will be remembered in history more for the setting than the content. Referring to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"", Trump has spent much of his speech attacking China for unleashing the Covid-19 pandemic on the world. He repeatedly says that Biden is a puppet of China, and at one point asks nurses and first responders in the audience to stand for applause. ""China
would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them
fully accountable for the tragedy they caused."" He adds that he himself has lost friends and loved ones to Covid-19 and touts the administration's role building ventilators for patients in the early days of the US outbreak. ""Unfortunately,
from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but
a partisan ability to criticise,"" he continues. ""When I took bold action to issue a travel ban
on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to
Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died."" Reality Check President Trump said 300 miles of border wall have been built since heâs been in office. Since January 2017, when he assumed the presidency, 275 miles of wall have been completed, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection report. However, most of that was to replace existing structures on the border. A total of 245 miles of wall has been built in place of old barriers. Only 30 miles of new wall, where no barriers previously existed, have been newly erected. Out of the 275 miles of wall built, 41 miles are so-called âsecondary wallâ, which is constructed behind the primary border barrier. In the 2016 race for president, Trump made building a wall along the USâs southern border with Mexico a key policy of his campaign, promising a ""big, beautiful"" structure along the 2,000 mile frontier. About 650 miles of fencing was built under President George W Bush. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"New Scottish law to break up 'super spreader' house partiesThe change, which comes into force on Friday, will limit indoor social gatherings to 15 people.","The first minister said police will only take action to disperse house parties as a last resort Police will have the power to break up house parties with more than 15 people from Friday in a bid to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Health officials have warned such gatherings could present ""high-risk super-spreader environments"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was necessary in anticipation of a rise in indoor gatherings as winter approached. And she said taking action now could prevent stricter lockdown measures. The measures werefirst announced last weekand the new limit was confirmed on Thursday. Under current guidance, no more than eight people from a maximum of three different households should be meeting indoors. The new law takes account of the varying size and composition of families and sets the limit for an indoor party at 15 people if more than one household is present. During her daily media briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We know from the reports of our test and protect teams - and also from evidence around the world - that these kinds of gatherings pose a significant transmission risk."" She acknowledged the colder weather would increase the likelihood of larger indoor social gatherings but said the new legislation was ""not a green light"" to ignoring the existing guidance. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In recognition that we intend these new legal powers to be a last resort only and for use in the most blatant breaches of the guidance, we have decided to set a higher threshold for their use. ""Ensuing that police have the powers to disperse large house parties, where that is necessary, is another important tool in trying to keep this virus suppressed."" She added that it would help to reduce the potential for future clusters and outbreaks and prevent greater lockdown restrictions. Addressing young people, Ms Sturgeon stressed that the move was ""not about trying to stop people having fun"" and added: ""We're not trying to police your social lives."" But the first minister said the move was necessary for the ""overall health and wellbeing of the country"". Chief Constable Iain Livingstone told the justice sub-committee on policing that he understood the need for a limit to be put into regulation. Mr Livingstone added: ""Where there is outright refusal, where they know the police service is at the door and they're refusing to let people in and turning the music up and continuing to act in that manner, we do need to go in. ""My position was that given the threat and the gravity of the public health threat that was a proportionate and legitimate power. ""That power has been granted but it is one we will use very lightly, enforcement will be the last resort, but it is there because it is clear from what the FM and others have said is the continuation of house parties remains a real threat.""

'Scared' patients urged to get vaccinations,"People are being urged to be up to date with their vaccinations Health bosses are hoping to reassure ""scared"" patients it is safe to go to GP surgeries to get vaccinations and flu jabs amid the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdown led to a rolling programme of vaccinations for conditions likes pneumonia and shingles halting. Now people are being urged to get the jabs they missed, as well as flu vaccines when they become available next month. There aresome fearswinter may lead to more Covid-19 cases. Vulnerable groups are being warned they could put themselves at greater risk if they fall ill with conditions such as flu and get coronavirus. ""Vaccinations are some of the most important things that you can do to prevent against those preventable diseases,"" said Teresa Owen, executive director of public health for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. ""They are so important and we want people to optimise their health and, hopefully, we'll reduce the risk of having two conditions at the same time."" Nurse Colette Hughes said vaccination clinics will look different due to extra safety measures Anyone aged 70 to 79 can have a vaccination against shingles, while a vaccine is also available for older people against pneumonia. Young people heading off to university are also being urged to make sure they have all the available vaccinations aimed at preventing meningitis. Meanwhile,Wales' largest ever flu campaignwill allow more people to obtain a vaccination from this autumn. The Welsh Government has set a flu vaccination target of 55% of people under the age of 65 who are in a clinical risk group. How bad will winter really be? How close are we to finding a treatment? Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? But the latest figures from 2019 show none of the 22 Welsh local authorities hit that target. Ms Owen hopes things will be different this year. ""I think there's more awareness of vaccinations this year,"" she said. ""And we certainly want to build on that by making it very easy for people to get their vaccinations."" Special treatment areas have been set up for vaccinations at Panton Surgery in Holywell The Panton Surgery in Holywell, Flintshire, is one practice where staff are keen to reassure the public it is safe for them to receive their vaccinations. Following the lockdown halting of vaccinations for conditions likes pneumonia and shingles, it is now trying to deal with a backlog of up to 200 patients. People are now being urged to come forward and get the jabs they missed. ""People are scared,"" said Colette Hughes, an advanced nurse practitioner. But, she added, everything had been done to reassure patients and to keep them and staff safe. ""It is safe and it is encouraged [to attend] but it will look different,"" she said. Appointments will mean that numbers will be limited at any one time, and as well as social distancing, patients will be asked to wear masks while they are at the centre. They will be expected to leave the building as quickly as they can once they have completed a 10 minute wait to ensure there are no side effects from their vaccination. ""When we do our flu clinics, you'll no longer come into our room,"" said Ms Hughes. ""We'll set up stations in the waiting area with screens for confidentiality and dignity. ""So, it will all look just slightly different but it's there to protect us as staff, the patients that are coming in and it's worked so far."" Patients Beryl McLaren and Roger Vacey have just received their vaccinations Patient Beryl McLaren, aged in her 70s, admits she had her concerns when she was contacted and asked to attend for a vaccination against pneumonia. ""They seemed to have got it organised quite well,"" she said. ""Being an older person, in the vulnerable group, I tend to take more care and anything I can do to protect myself, I will do."" Roger Vacey attended the clinic to get a shingles vaccine. Now 71, he's also had the flu jab every year since he became eligible for it at the age of 65. ""You've probably got to get all the vaccinations you can,"" he said. ""If it helps to protect you, then all the better, isn't it?"" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

New Scottish law to break up 'super spreader' house parties,"The first minister said police will only take action to disperse house parties as a last resort Police will have the power to break up house parties with more than 15 people from Friday in a bid to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Health officials have warned such gatherings could present ""high-risk super-spreader environments"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was necessary in anticipation of a rise in indoor gatherings as winter approached. And she said taking action now could prevent stricter lockdown measures. The measures werefirst announced last weekand the new limit was confirmed on Thursday. Under current guidance, no more than eight people from a maximum of three different households should be meeting indoors. The new law takes account of the varying size and composition of families and sets the limit for an indoor party at 15 people if more than one household is present. During her daily media briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We know from the reports of our test and protect teams - and also from evidence around the world - that these kinds of gatherings pose a significant transmission risk."" She acknowledged the colder weather would increase the likelihood of larger indoor social gatherings but said the new legislation was ""not a green light"" to ignoring the existing guidance. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In recognition that we intend these new legal powers to be a last resort only and for use in the most blatant breaches of the guidance, we have decided to set a higher threshold for their use. ""Ensuing that police have the powers to disperse large house parties, where that is necessary, is another important tool in trying to keep this virus suppressed."" She added that it would help to reduce the potential for future clusters and outbreaks and prevent greater lockdown restrictions. Addressing young people, Ms Sturgeon stressed that the move was ""not about trying to stop people having fun"" and added: ""We're not trying to police your social lives."" But the first minister said the move was necessary for the ""overall health and wellbeing of the country"". Chief Constable Iain Livingstone told the justice sub-committee on policing that he understood the need for a limit to be put into regulation. Mr Livingstone added: ""Where there is outright refusal, where they know the police service is at the door and they're refusing to let people in and turning the music up and continuing to act in that manner, we do need to go in. ""My position was that given the threat and the gravity of the public health threat that was a proportionate and legitimate power. ""That power has been granted but it is one we will use very lightly, enforcement will be the last resort, but it is there because it is clear from what the FM and others have said is the continuation of house parties remains a real threat.""

Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders?,"This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest A US teenager has been cleared of all charges in relation to two men he shot and killed during unrest in Wisconsin. What do we know about Kyle Rittenhouse? After a black man, Jacob Blake, was shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, two nights of rioting erupted. On the third night, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fired on three men with a military-style semi-automatic rifle, killing two and seriously injuring a third. He was arrested at his mother's home in Antioch, Illinois, some 30 minutes from Kenosha. A day later he was charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and one count of first-degree reckless homicide. Videos indicate he spent hours on Tuesday apparently helping patrol the streets. He told journalists it was his ""job"" to guard buildings and even offer medical assistance to protesters. Before dropping out of high school, he participated in cadet programmes with the fire department and police. Kyle Rittenhouse gave an emotional testimony in his defence in court His social media profiles show his support for law enforcement. A Facebook photo of him was framed with the ""Blue Lives Matter"" logo - a pro-police movement that has occasionally clashed with Black Lives Matter supporters. Several of his posts honoured police officers killed on duty, and he also posted pictures of himself wearing full police uniform. He is a former member of a local police cadet programme, Grayslake Police Department says. Guns are another of his passions. Photos show him posing with weapons, practising target shooting and assembling a rifle. After leaving school, he had a few jobs including one as a lifeguard. When the protests over Jacob Blake's shooting became violent, Mr Rittenhouse travelled to the city and armed himself with a semi-automatic rifle, with the intention of protecting property, he said. Cars were burnt by protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin during angry clashes In an interview on the night before the shootings, he echoes police language when telling a journalist why he is armed. ""Part of my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way,"" he says. He was captured on video at different times during that night. At one point, he speaks to police who offer him water. What we know about the shooting of Jacob Blake Later, he was shown being pursued by a group of people, one of whom appeared to fire into the air. The teenager turns to see where the sound is coming from as another person tries to attack him. At that point, the teenager appears to shoot the man, later identified as Joseph Rosenbaum. He was unarmed but Mr Rittenhouse said in court that he had tried to grab his gun, testimony corroborated by one of the prosecution's own witnesses. Fleeing momentarily, he finds himself chased by a crowd who had seen him shoot Rosenbaum, before falling to the ground, and firing his gun. One of those hit by the gunfire falls to the ground, fatally injured. He is later named as Anthony Huber. Huber was seen on video swinging his skateboard at Rittenhouse. Another person runs away apparently injured. In court, Gaige Grosskreutz acknowledged confronting Rittenhouse with a gun, even pointing it at him, but he denied he ever intended to shoot him. One of the charges brought against him was possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18. It was later dropped when his lawyers successfully argued state law allowed for someone under 18 to possess the firearm. Correction 9th October 2020: This article was amended in the hours after publication to give a more detailed account of the sequence of events and make clear that Kyle Rittenhouse was seen on video being pursued by a group of people before the first shooting.

"Support rises for reopening schools, say pollsters","Schools are getting measures in place for a safe reopening Public confidence in the full reopening of schools in September seems to be growing, according to an opinion poll. A YouGov survey shows support for the full-time reopening of schools in England and Wales has risen from 57% to 65% over the past three weeks. Millions of pupils will begin returning to school from next week. But the opinion poll also shows 19% of adults opposed to reopening and 16% who don't know. Schools have been preparing for the safe return of pupils, with children to be kept apart in ""bubbles"", alongside hand sanitisers, one-way systems, staggered start and finish times and reconfigured timetables. But there have been questions about whether parents have been convinced by the safety measures. The YouGov survey, based on almost 3,300 people in England, Wales and Scotland, suggests a shift in attitudes towards backing the full-time return to school, after the long disruption of the lockdown. PM says 'moral duty' to get pupils back to school Does my child have to return to school? Ditch truancy fines as pupils return, say doctors In a previous survey on 4 August, the pollsters had found more scepticism about reopening schools, with 25% opposed and 18% who don't know. The follow-up survey, from 26 August, shows 19% opposed and 16% who don't know. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton says this matches what schools are now saying, with the expectation ""that the vast majority of pupils will attend from the beginning of term"". But he says there will still be some parents ""who will be anxious and it will take time to build confidence"". Chris Curtis, political research manager at the polling firm, says the public seems to back the idea that reopening schools should be the ""top priority"". But he highlights that growing support for opening schools is alongside an increasingly negative view of how the government is handling education. Boris Johnson has been urging a full return to school ""The proportion of Britons who think schools should fully reopen after the summer holidays has increased to 65%, while at the same time the level of Brits who think the government is handling the issue of education badly is steadily increasing - up 15 percentage points since last week,"" said Mr Curtis. The latest polling suggests more support for sending pupils back to school - but this is a survey of the general adult population, not just parents, and there are some underlying differences. There is below-average support for going back to school among the less affluent and younger. The strongest support for reopening schools is among those who are older, in higher-income brackets and in the south of England. The government has been pushing a strong message about the need for pupils to go back after so much time out of school - and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is a ""moral duty"". But tracking polls for YouGov show an increasingly negative view of the political handling of education among the public in England, Wales and Scotland,  with support collapsing through the course of the lockdown. At the end of March, there was a positive view of how education was being handled: 46% thought it was being handled ""well"", compared with 35% who thought it was being handled ""badly"". But dissatisfaction has risen sharply over the summer, through the months when pupils have been taught at home and during the problems with exam results. The most recent figures, for last week, showed 61% thought education was being handled badly, compared with 27% who thought it was being handled well.

Major fire and diesel spill after train derails,"This video can not be played Investigations begin into railway diesel spill at Llangennech A freight train carrying diesel has derailed and burst into flames, with fuel spilling into a nearby river. About 300 people were evacuated from their homes in Llangennech, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, during the ""major incident"" on Wednesday night. Natural Resources Wales said it was not safe to try and contain a diesel spill which had gone into the River Loughor. A driver and engineer, onboard the train, were not injured and are being supported, owners DB Cargo UK said. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver had noticed something was wrong with the train, which was travelling from Milford Haven. It then derailed and the fire started. The blaze, which was still burning Thursday evening, was reported at about 23:20 BST on Wednesday and police said it had been declared a ""major incident"" due to the ""initial risk of harm"" to people nearby. People living within 800m of the fire described seeing ""plumes of smoke"" and seeing flames from the tracks, when they were evacuated from their homes. They have since been allowed back. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it was carrying out a preliminary examination and gathering evidence. Louise Perkins says she saw a ""massive fire and black smoke"" British Transport Police and Natural Resources Wales said their priorities, once they are able to access the site, were the fire itself and making the scene safe, as well as the environmental issues resulting from the spill. Bill Kelly, from Network Rail, said damage to the infrastructure was significant and would be further assessed by teams ""when it is safe for us to do so"". ""In terms of services this will obviously impact the central Wales line... I don't have timescales just yet on when we're likely to get them running again,"" he added. ""We will be able to continue running freight services using diversionary routes."" Ioan Williams, from Natural Resources Wales, said ""a significant volume of diesel has been spilled... we can confirm there is diesel in the River Loughor itself."" Puma Energy confirmed the third party-operated train was carrying its fuel from Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, to Theale, near Reading, when three tanks caught fire. ""Our immediate priority is to work with the emergency services, Network Rail, environmental agencies and the train operator to ensure public safety is maintained and any possible environmental impacts are mitigated,"" a spokesman said. Puma Energy has not yet confirmed how much fuel the train was carrying, or how much caught fire. The site of the derailment is close to the Loughor Estuary, which is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation. The tankers are being monitored and cooled, the fire service say But Aneurin Cox, duty incident manager for Natural Resources Wales, said it was ""not currently safe"" for workers to get close enough to try and contain the spill while the fire was burning. ""Once it's safe to do so, we will work with our partners to fully assess the environmental impact and advise Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin,"" he said. ""We will also be keeping local angling and cockling groups informed of the latest situation."" The cockle beds in the Burry Inlet - worked by 35 licensed pickers - have been closed following the diesel spill. Robert Griffiths, secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association, said he had been contacted by fisheries officers following a meeting of a number of agencies which monitor the beds. Mr Griffiths said the extent of any diesel pollution was still being assessed and it was hoped the closure would last only a few days. Louise Perkins, who lives close to the railway line, said she grabbed some stuff and rushed from her home with her children, aged seven, 12 and 19, in the middle of the night. The 38-year-old was up late watching TV when she heard an enormous bang: ""There was this massive fire and black smoke. ""As we left it was just fire - you could see like balls of it puffing up, and the smell... the smell of diesel. ""It was just everywhere, and there were just black, black clouds of smoke in the air."" Emergency services had dealt with a ""fast-moving"" and ""large scale"" situation, police say Ms Perkins said she was ""quite worried"" when police explained ""it could explode"". ""At that point my children were up and and they got really distressed,"" she said. Her 19-year-old son went to his friend's house while her two younger children went to their grandmother's. ""They were worried - 'oh, what if our house catches fire, what about all the stuff?'"" she explained. ""I told them not to panic. But my youngest was really upset, she was just heartbroken, she was crying."" The fire started after a number of tanks of the train derailed One Twitter user said,externalthey could smell burning fuel from ""well over a mile away"". Councillor Gwyneth Thomas, a former A&E nurse, was at the scene to offer help if needed and said how ""hugely impressed"" she was by ""how calm"" the emergency service personnel were. ""Some carried young children and others took their dogs with them,"" she recalled. ""It's very fortunate that the accident didn't happen closer to Llangennech [railway] station where there are more homes, and evacuation of residents would have been more difficult."" Sandra Thomas says she was watching TV in bed when police came knocking at her door Sandra Thomas has lived on Pontarddulais Road since 1972 and said nothing like this had ever happened before and the fire went up ""like a bomb"". ""I was terrified - I'm shaking all over,"" she said, adding police knocked on her door while she was watching TV in bed. She was sent to the community centre, but was allowed to return home on Thursday morning. But Ms Thomas became concerned when she looked out of her window at 08:00 to see a large black plume of smoke. ""I don't feel 100% safe in case it sparks off again and the rest of the tankers go up,"" she added. Llangennech is near the Carmarthenshire-Swansea county border, in south-west Wales Speaking at a press conference just before midday, Supt Andy Morgan, of BTP, said: ""While this is an ongoing incident that may go on for some time, we are hugely thankful that no-one has been injured or anything more serious than that has happened here."" When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed. Multiple emergency services and agencies attended The fire has also resulted in delays on passenger trains between Llanelli and Llandrindod Wells in Powys,Transport for Wales said,external. All lines between the two stations have been closed and TfW said it expected disruption on all routes throughout Thursday. Buses will be put on for services affected by the fire. From the Loughor estuary along to the Burry inlet, is an important habitat for wading birds and wildfowl The River Loughor's estuary, along with the Burry Inlet to the west, is designated as a site of special scientific interest Its habitat of tidal mudflats, saltmarsh - the largest continuous area in Wales - and rockpools offer important wildlife habitat Species of wading birds and wildfowl include oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, little egret, widgeon, dunlin, plover and teal The estuary is known for its fishing grounds, for the likes of flounder, bass and mullet Further west, the Burry Inlet's cockle beds are well known, with the industry the third largest in Britain In that same area is the WWT Llanelli wetland centre, a popular place for spotting wading birds and wildfowl and the 450 acres of grounds.

Pret A Manger to cut over a third of UK workforce,"Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to cut 3,000 jobs, or more than a third of its workforce, as part of a plan to save the business. The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre. The chain has been hit as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market - has plunged in the pandemic. It had already said it would permanently close 30 of its stores earlier this summer. Boss Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to lose so many colleagues. ""Although we're now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret. ""We've managed to protect many jobs by making changes to the way we run our shops and the hours we ask team members to work. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again."" Pret a Manger to cut staff hours Upper Crust owner to cut up to 5,000 jobs Like other retailers, Pret was forced to close for several months during lockdown, but while restrictions have eased, its trading has remained subdued. It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours. The chain said its weekly sales were around Â£5.2m in August - about the level they were in August 2010, when the business was considerably smaller. However, it said a recovery was ""clearly under way"", with sales having grown by 7% each week since July. The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week. It is the latest hospitality company to announce cuts due to the impact of the pandemic. Upper Crust-owner SSP Group has said it will cut up to 5,000 jobs, as it struggles with the reduction in passenger travel at railway stations and airports. Pizza Express, Byron Burger and Frankie & Benny's owner, the Restaurant Group, have also announced large-scale store closures and job cuts. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

That's it for our live coverage for today. If you're just catching up with the headlines, here's a taste of what's been going on around the UK. Cases of coronavirus in the UK are on the rise We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly. Thank you for following our coverage
of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world.
They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing.

Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

SA conservationist killed by his own white lions,"West Mathewson had known the lionesses since they were cubs A well-known South African conservationist has died after he was mauled by two white lions as he was taking them for a walk. The wife of West Mathewson, who followed in a car, tried to distract the lions but it was too late. He ran a popular safari lodge, Lion Tree Top Lodge, in Limpopo province. The lionesses have since been moved to another game lodge and are expected to be released into the wild at a later stage. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories What are the world's deadliest animals? A lioness became aggressive towards the other and then turned her attention to the conservationist affectionately known as ""Uncle West"", reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko from Johannesburg. His relatives have said that Wednesday's attack could have been the result of very rough play. The lionesses were tranquillised following the attack and have been taken to an endangered species centre. Mr Mathewson is said to have rescued the lions from ""canned hunting"" - when animals are hunted in an enclosed area, or they are bred to be hunted - and they were kept in an enclosure at his lodge. The lionesses reportedly killed a man working on a neighbouring property after they broke out of the enclosure in 2017. This video can not be played Are people hunting 'canned lions' in South Africa?

"Daily UK coronavirus cases highest since mid-JuneThe number of new positive test results has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours.Health","The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in 24 hours - up from 1,048 on Wednesday - the highest tally since mid-June. This is still much lower than the 5,000 new cases a day in April, at the peak of the epidemic. Cases have been rising across Europeand began edging up again in the UK in July, after falling in June. A number of areas have seen a spike in infections, with Birmingham and Northampton the latest places affected. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? And experts suspect a relatively small number of areas in the UK are responsible for an increase in new cases. Testing has also increased over recent weeks and this means more people with the virus are being detected. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". However,NHS England's Test and Trace scheme,externalis still failing to actually hit its 80% target, with weekly figures showing the time taken to turn around results is getting longer. The last weekly testing of people in thousands of private households, by theOffice for National Statistics (ONS),external, seen as the most accurate picture of new infections, suggested cases were levelling off.

"Davey wins Liberal Democrat leadership raceThe acting leader will now take on the top job permanently, beating his rival Layla Moran.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey, the newly-elected leader of the Lib Dems, said his party must ""start listening"" Sir Ed Davey has won the race to become the new leader of the Liberal Democrats. The acting leader will now take over on a permanent basis after beating his competitor, fellow MP Layla Moran. Sir Ed secured 63.5% of the vote, compared to 36.5% for Ms Moran. At an event in London, Sir Ed said it was time for the party to ""wake up and smell the coffee"" after only securing 12% of the vote in the last general election. In an email to party members, he said he would launch a ""national listening project"" to help make the Lib Dems ""relevant again"", adding: ""We won't be able to do this unless we show people we share their values and are on their side."" The result comes eight months after the Lib Dem's former leader, Jo Swinson, stepped down from the role after losing her seat in 2019 general election. Ms Moran congratulated her opponent on Twitter, saying: ""I look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for Britain."" Who is new leader Ed Davey? Lib Dem candidates pitch for votes Is targeting the 'yellow halo' key to party's success? Sir Ed has been a member of the Liberal Democrats for 30 years, and acting leader since Ms Swinson left the role in December. He was elected as an MP in 1997, but lost his seat of Kingston and Surbiton in 2015 after his tenure as a cabinet minister in the coalition government. In the 2017 snap election, Sir Ed returned to Parliament for the same constituency and will now lead the party's 11 MPs and wider membership. In his victory speech, the new leader spoke of the task ahead, with the party only achieving single digit support in the the latest opinion polls. ""Nationally our party has lost touch with too many voters,"" he said. ""Yes, we are powerful advocates locally. Our campaigners listen to local people, work hard for communities and deliver results. ""But at the national level. We have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results."" He added: ""The truth is, voters don't believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life. ""It is time for us to start listening. And as leader, I have got that message. I am listening now."" Analysis by Leila Nathoo, BBC political correspondent Sir Ed Davey takes over from his predecessor Jo Swinson This was Sir Ed Davey's second attempt to win the Liberal Democrat leadership - he lost out to Jo Swinson last year. This time round, he comfortably persuaded party members that his years of experience in government and Parliament were in fact an advantage, and a better bet than his challenger's pitch for change. Sir Ed acknowledged that his task now is to try to restore the party's fortunes. It has just 11 MPs in the Commons after being punished over three general elections following the coalition with the Conservatives. And the wave of defections during the heady days of the Brexit process turned out to be a flash in the pan. The Liberal Democrats' Remain position was rejected by voters in 2019, and, now in a post-Brexit world - and with the Labour party too under new management - Sir Ed will be looking to move on. He will hope that his focus on climate change can redefine the Lib Dems and help them regain national relevance one again. Sir Ed also thanked Ms Moran for her ""passionate campaign"" and promised the education spokeswoman a ""big role"" in his team. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron congratulated Sir Ed on his win, calling him a ""fantastic campaigner who has the experience and vision to move our party forward"". And fellow MP Wera Hobhouse, who pulled out of the leadership race, said she looked forward to ""a new positive future for our party"". Leadership candidate Layla Moran congratulated Sir Ed on Twitter The Lib Dems originally planned to delay the contest to succeed Ms Swinson until May 2021. But the party brought it forward following criticism from party members. The two-month contest began in June, but most hustings and meetings  had to take place virtually due to coronavirus. The party issued 117,924 ballots for the contest - the largest number in its history - and turnout was 57.6%. Sir Ed won with 42,756 votes, while Ms Moran got 24,564 votes. The margin was the largest of a Lib Dem leadership winner since the late Paddy Ashdown secured 71% of his party's vote in 1988.

"New Scottish law to break up 'super spreader' house partiesThe change, which comes into force on Friday, will limit indoor social gatherings to 15 people.Scotland","The first minister said police will only take action to disperse house parties as a last resort Police will have the power to break up house parties with more than 15 people from Friday in a bid to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Health officials have warned such gatherings could present ""high-risk super-spreader environments"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was necessary in anticipation of a rise in indoor gatherings as winter approached. And she said taking action now could prevent stricter lockdown measures. The measures werefirst announced last weekand the new limit was confirmed on Thursday. Under current guidance, no more than eight people from a maximum of three different households should be meeting indoors. The new law takes account of the varying size and composition of families and sets the limit for an indoor party at 15 people if more than one household is present. During her daily media briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We know from the reports of our test and protect teams - and also from evidence around the world - that these kinds of gatherings pose a significant transmission risk."" She acknowledged the colder weather would increase the likelihood of larger indoor social gatherings but said the new legislation was ""not a green light"" to ignoring the existing guidance. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In recognition that we intend these new legal powers to be a last resort only and for use in the most blatant breaches of the guidance, we have decided to set a higher threshold for their use. ""Ensuing that police have the powers to disperse large house parties, where that is necessary, is another important tool in trying to keep this virus suppressed."" She added that it would help to reduce the potential for future clusters and outbreaks and prevent greater lockdown restrictions. Addressing young people, Ms Sturgeon stressed that the move was ""not about trying to stop people having fun"" and added: ""We're not trying to police your social lives."" But the first minister said the move was necessary for the ""overall health and wellbeing of the country"". Chief Constable Iain Livingstone told the justice sub-committee on policing that he understood the need for a limit to be put into regulation. Mr Livingstone added: ""Where there is outright refusal, where they know the police service is at the door and they're refusing to let people in and turning the music up and continuing to act in that manner, we do need to go in. ""My position was that given the threat and the gravity of the public health threat that was a proportionate and legitimate power. ""That power has been granted but it is one we will use very lightly, enforcement will be the last resort, but it is there because it is clear from what the FM and others have said is the continuation of house parties remains a real threat.""

Davey wins Liberal Democrat leadership race,"This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey, the newly-elected leader of the Lib Dems, said his party must ""start listening"" Sir Ed Davey has won the race to become the new leader of the Liberal Democrats. The acting leader will now take over on a permanent basis after beating his competitor, fellow MP Layla Moran. Sir Ed secured 63.5% of the vote, compared to 36.5% for Ms Moran. At an event in London, Sir Ed said it was time for the party to ""wake up and smell the coffee"" after only securing 12% of the vote in the last general election. In an email to party members, he said he would launch a ""national listening project"" to help make the Lib Dems ""relevant again"", adding: ""We won't be able to do this unless we show people we share their values and are on their side."" The result comes eight months after the Lib Dem's former leader, Jo Swinson, stepped down from the role after losing her seat in 2019 general election. Ms Moran congratulated her opponent on Twitter, saying: ""I look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for Britain."" Who is new leader Ed Davey? Lib Dem candidates pitch for votes Is targeting the 'yellow halo' key to party's success? Sir Ed has been a member of the Liberal Democrats for 30 years, and acting leader since Ms Swinson left the role in December. He was elected as an MP in 1997, but lost his seat of Kingston and Surbiton in 2015 after his tenure as a cabinet minister in the coalition government. In the 2017 snap election, Sir Ed returned to Parliament for the same constituency and will now lead the party's 11 MPs and wider membership. In his victory speech, the new leader spoke of the task ahead, with the party only achieving single digit support in the the latest opinion polls. ""Nationally our party has lost touch with too many voters,"" he said. ""Yes, we are powerful advocates locally. Our campaigners listen to local people, work hard for communities and deliver results. ""But at the national level. We have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results."" He added: ""The truth is, voters don't believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life. ""It is time for us to start listening. And as leader, I have got that message. I am listening now."" Analysis by Leila Nathoo, BBC political correspondent Sir Ed Davey takes over from his predecessor Jo Swinson This was Sir Ed Davey's second attempt to win the Liberal Democrat leadership - he lost out to Jo Swinson last year. This time round, he comfortably persuaded party members that his years of experience in government and Parliament were in fact an advantage, and a better bet than his challenger's pitch for change. Sir Ed acknowledged that his task now is to try to restore the party's fortunes. It has just 11 MPs in the Commons after being punished over three general elections following the coalition with the Conservatives. And the wave of defections during the heady days of the Brexit process turned out to be a flash in the pan. The Liberal Democrats' Remain position was rejected by voters in 2019, and, now in a post-Brexit world - and with the Labour party too under new management - Sir Ed will be looking to move on. He will hope that his focus on climate change can redefine the Lib Dems and help them regain national relevance one again. Sir Ed also thanked Ms Moran for her ""passionate campaign"" and promised the education spokeswoman a ""big role"" in his team. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron congratulated Sir Ed on his win, calling him a ""fantastic campaigner who has the experience and vision to move our party forward"". And fellow MP Wera Hobhouse, who pulled out of the leadership race, said she looked forward to ""a new positive future for our party"". Leadership candidate Layla Moran congratulated Sir Ed on Twitter The Lib Dems originally planned to delay the contest to succeed Ms Swinson until May 2021. But the party brought it forward following criticism from party members. The two-month contest began in June, but most hustings and meetings  had to take place virtually due to coronavirus. The party issued 117,924 ballots for the contest - the largest number in its history - and turnout was 57.6%. Sir Ed won with 42,756 votes, while Ms Moran got 24,564 votes. The margin was the largest of a Lib Dem leadership winner since the late Paddy Ashdown secured 71% of his party's vote in 1988.

Mask rule for Parisians amid 'undeniable surge',"Parisian cyclists don't have to wear a face mask but some are taking extra precautions Wearing a face mask in public has become mandatory across Paris and several surrounding areas, amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in France. On Friday the country recorded 7,379 new infections - its highest number since early May. The number of ""red zones"" where the virus is in active circulation has risen from two to 21. Announcing new local curbs on Thursday, PM Jean Castex said he wanted to avoid another general lockdown. He said the coronavirus was ""gaining ground"" across France, and that if the government did not act fast infection growth could become ""exponential"". Despite a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks, daily death tolls have remained low. Overall, more than 30,500 people have died and almost 300,000 have been infected in France. A number of European countries are seeing a surge in new cases, and Germany is also planning tighter rules. Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Friday that in the coming months things would become ""even more difficult than now"", as people have been able to enjoy life outdoors over the summer. The French prime minister said all pedestrians would have to wear face masks in public areas in the capital from 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT). While individual streets and areas of the capital already have rules on wearing face coverings, this new rule will be far more extensive, covering not only Paris but its inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. Mask-wearing has taken over the streets of Paris by stealth over the past few months, and the blanket enforcement of face masks in and around the capital from 08:00 triggered little real outcry, except for one thing: the new rules were originally designed to apply to cyclists and runners, along with pedestrians. By the time the regulation came into force this morning, Paris city hall had intervened, and won a reprieve, saying it was ""dangerous"" and ""counter-productive"" to force these two groups to wear masks, especially when the mayor had been encouraging people to cycle to work to relieve pressure on public transport. While cyclists have been given a reprieve, the rules still stand for motorcyclists and people on scooters Runners and cyclists aside, only a handful of people were still out without a mask in my neighbourhood this morning, and there seems to be a lot of support for the measure around the capital. ""It's better than being locked down,"" one woman said. Another resident said the government should have brought it in earlier, so that ""the situation wouldn't have got as bad as it is now"". Asked on Friday if smokers could take off the mask to have a cigarette, Paris Deputy Mayor Anne Souyris made clear this was not the case. ""You're not allowed to smoke on the street without a mask; you can't take it off, so you must find another way,"" she told the Cnews channel. Paris is already a red zone, along with the southern area of Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, where France's second-largest city Marseille made masks compulsory from Wednesday evening. A broad expanse of the Mediterranean coast and the Gironde area around Bordeaux are also red zones. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Masks will also become part of normal life for French schoolchildren aged 11 and over. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended use of masks in school from the age of 12. Masks are already required in most enclosed public spaces and will be mandatory in workplaces from next week. However, the two biggest cities in the Netherlands have decided to scrap a pilot scheme for compulsory masks in their busiest areas on Monday. The Amsterdam and Rotterdam authorities say they may bring back the requirement if necessary, but they believe that as the warm weather and high tourist season come to an end it will be easier to maintain social distancing of 1.5m (5ft). France to make masks mandatory in most workplaces What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Masks are a key part of Germany's tougher restrictions aimed at curbing a renewed rise in cases. Although Germany has not seen the scale of Covid-related deaths as many other Western European countries, the federal government and 16 states have reached a deal on new measures: A minimum â¬50 (Â£45) fine will be slapped on anyone breaking rules on face coverings - in shops, public transport or elsewhere; Lower Saxony in the north-west will not impose fines but Bavaria in the south will set higher penalties Big events will be banned until the end of the year, although regions will be exempt if they have a low infection rate and participants are limited to those areas A working group will be set up to discuss Bundesliga football matches, but no spectators will be allowed in until at least the end of October There will be an end to free tests for holidaymakers returning from high-risk countries after 15 September. Travellers already have to self-isolate for 14 days. Bavaria will continue free testing until 1 October. During her summer press conference on Friday, Mrs Merkel said Germans would ""have to live with this virus for longer"" and maintain vigilance, especially as the number of infections had risen in recent weeks. Another 1,571 cases and three more deaths were reported on Friday. Germany extends coronavirus pay top-up scheme Germany puts on crowded concerts to study Covid Meanwhile, a group called ""Querdenken"" (Think outside the box) is challenging a Berlin ban on a march on Saturday against Covid-19 restrictions. The protest has already seen 22,000 people sign up. A march on 1 August attracted around 20,000 people, made up of mainly Covid-deniers and far-right activists.

Low-paid workers to get Â£13 a day to self-isolate,"The payment will only be available for people who claim benefits Workers on low incomes in parts of England where there are high rates of coronavirus will be able to claim up to Â£182 if they have to self-isolate. From Tuesday, those who claim Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit and cannot work from home will be able to get the money  - equal to Â£13 a day. The benefit will be trialled in parts of north-west England first. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the payment ""goes nowhere near far enough"", adding people need ""full pay"". Employed or self-employed people who test positive for the virus are required to isolate for 10 days, so those eligible for the extra money will get Â£130. But members of the household of someone who has tested positive, who must self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to up to Â£182, assuming they also qualify for the payment. Anyone else who is told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers and meets the qualification criteria will also be entitled to Â£13 a day -about the same as statutory sick pay,external- for however long they must self-isolate. The payment, announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, applies to benefit claimants who live in areas where there are high numbers of coronavirus cases. It comes as the government saida further 12 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,external, taking the total number of virus-related deaths to 41,477. There were a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of 09:00 BST on Thursday, up from 1,048 cases a day earlier. The overall number of people to have tested positive is now 330,368. The scheme will be trialled in Blackburn and other parts of north-west England The England-wide scheme will begin with a trial in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham, wherethere have been tighter lockdown measures after a rise in cases. If the payment is successful it will be ""quickly"" rolled out to other areas where there are lots of cases, the Department of Health said. 'No socialising' rules in parts of North West Commuter towns see sharp rise in benefit claims According to data published earlier this month,nearly 5.5 million people across the UK are now claiming benefits - an 81% increase since March. ""Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks,"" said Mr Hancock. He said the payments had been introduced after feedback from England's contact tracing programme, NHS Test and Trace, and would mean people ""don't lose out by doing the right thing"". ""The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus,"" said Mr Hancock The health secretary told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". Latest figures,externalfor the week to 19 August suggest 72% of people who tested positive were reached by NHS Test and Trace. Those people provided details of more than 24,000 close contacts and just over 75% of those were reached. Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 The data also showed turnaround times for coronavirus tests has increased, with the average wait for results now more than 24 hours for those done at mobile units and testing centres. The government said the rising number of tests being done had created a backlog, which the service was working hard to catch up on. England's NHS Test and Trace service is now three months old - plenty of time to get established and to be judged on. So how is it doing? The key goal was to achieve reach 80% of people who test positive and 80% of their contacts. It has consistently fallen short of that - but only just. Another target is to ensure test results are processed quickly. The fact those waits are getting longer is concerning. The initial design of the service also looks questionable with too much emphasis on the national contact tracing unit rather than local teams. That is now in the process of being rectified with councils establishing their own dedicated tracing teams. But, at the end of the day, the true test of the service - and the wider government's response for that matter - is whether the virus is contained. There have been some signs of an increase in infections in recent weeks - although part of that is likely to be down to extra testing as the more the look the more you find. And if you look at our near neighbours, such as France and Spain, the UK seems to be doing well. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is things could certainly be worse. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had been ""calling for weeks"" for the government to provide financial support for those asked to self-isolate. ""I am pleased they have at last acknowledged this issue but am sorry to say this move goes nowhere near far enough."" ""The health secretary has already said that he couldn't live on Statutory Sick Pay at Â£95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?"" He added that it would not provide the support many workers in Greater Manchester needed to co-operate with NHS Test and Trace and called for the government to enable people ""to self-isolate on full pay"". Mohammed Iqbal, Labour leader of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while financial support was welcome, Â£13 a day was ""a slap in the face"". ""I've spoken to people who have tested positive who I have persuaded to stay home and the kick back from them is to say... 'who is going to put food on the table for my wife and children?', and that is a question we have been pushing back to government for a few weeks now,"" he said. 'This food bank is a lifesaver to me' People will need to provide evidence - including, for example, proof of a positive test, a message from NHS Test and Trace and a bank statement - and the money will be provided within 48 hours, the government said. Mr Hancock said the aim was to get money to people quickly - at the start of their isolation ""rather than afterwards"". The government said checks will be undertaken to make sure people who apply are unable to work from home. The payment will not reduce any other benefits that a person may already receive. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government had encouraged UK ministers to put support in place - but that more detail was needed about how it would be introduced. ""It seems to me to make sense for [payments] to be administered through existing welfare or benefits systems, and obviously we are seeking to understand what the financial consequential position is for the Scottish government,"" she said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Universal Credit payments have been increased by Â£20 a week for the period between April 2020 and March 2021 due to the pandemic, but Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected calls from campaigners to also scrap the benefits cap for the same duration. The benefit cap limits how much any one household can receive in benefits. In other news: Police in England and Wales have seen a 31% rise in assaults on emergency services workers in the four weeks to 2 August, compared to the same period last year. Martin Hewitt chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council said he was ""disgusted"" by the increase at a time when emergency services were on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic The number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England fell slightly in the week to 19 August, down to 6,115 from 6,656 the week before. But it is still the second highest weekly figure since mid-June No new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. It comes after the first deaths following a positive test in the nation for six weeks wereannounced on Wednesday The take up of the flu jab among people in vulnerable groups has declined, according to BBC analysis, despite plans to double the number of people who receive it.

"You finally got abroad, but was it worth it?","Queuing to get a socially-distanced sunbathing spot on the beach. Wearing your face mask to the hotel bar. Finding out halfway through your trip that you'll have to quarantine when you get home. People are going abroad for holidays for the first time in months, but as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, is it worth the hassle? Several plans have fallen through forGrace Wildingso far this summer. The 19-year-old trainee teacher had been looking forward to a big family holiday in a villa in Spain, but they postponed the trip for fears her baby nephew could catch the virus. Grace and her boyfriendAlfie Archer, 18, had also booked a trip to Cape Verde, but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. The couple didn't want to lose the opportunity to soak up some sun on their first summer holiday together, and they felt that the virus posed a low risk to them as young and healthy people - so they began hunting for a last-minute deal. ""I'd say I feel safer here than home definitely. The same rules are applied but everyone actually follows them here,"" says Grace from her hotel in Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. The Liverpool Hope University student from Halton, Cheshire, says she was glad to hear flight attendants reminding people to wear face masks on the plane, and that she waited patiently in line for temperature checks at the airport in Tenerife, and happily shared her details with local contact tracers. In Grace and Alfie's hotel, everyone wears face coverings at all times until they reach their rooms, sun loungers, or dinner tables. ""Wearing the masks in the heat can be a bit of a nuisance at times, but this is the climate we've decided to put ourselves in so we will abide by the rules like everyone else,"" she says. Grace Wilding says everyone's following coronavirus rules at her hotel in Playa de las Americas In restaurants ""you're greeted with hand sanitiser before you sit down"", she says. And the couple has mostly steered clear of going to the beach, where officials make people queue up to get a sunbathing spot that's a safe distance from other holidaymakers. In keeping with the theme of the summer so far, more of Grace's plans were scuppered whenthe UK's quarantine rules changed for Spain- including the Canary Islands - while they were away. Grace and Alfie are now having to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to the UK. Where can I go on holiday and what are the restrictions? What are my holiday travel and insurance rights? Spain quarantine: 'We found out three minutes after landing' Grace admits the couple wouldn't have gone to Tenerife if they had known they would have to quarantine when they came back. Alfie worries about the two weeks of income he will lose, because he is a joiner so cannot work while isolating. But Grace remains upbeat. She says the news meant they enjoyed the holiday ""probably even more"" as they made the most of their last days of relative freedom before flying home. ""I wouldn't hold back on booking another holiday,"" Grace adds. ""The world can't stop for any longer, in my opinion."" AsBen Osbornedescribes his family holiday over the phone, his voice is partly drowned out by the sound of his sons shouting and playing at their rented apartment in Lake Como, Italy. ""They're having a fantastic time,"" he laughs. The family of five, from Hereford, have been to water parks, on day trips, and spent a lot of time at the pool they share with others in the apartment block. Ben, who works for Vodafone as a customer solutions architect, says the pandemic hasn't got in the way of their holiday at all. They've even taken a mini-break from social distancing. Ben, 39, and his wife Nadia, 37, decided they wouldn't be too strict on their children adhering to Italy's one-metre rule during the 11-day holiday, so they have mixed with other young families staying in the complex. Ben says this doesn't mean they have completely given up on social distancing and the adults are remaining wary around each other. But he says three-year-old Cooper has ""absolutely no concept of staying away from people"" and so the rules have also been relaxed for his older brothers Ashton, 10, and Carter, eight. The Osbornes found Lake Como to be much quieter than on their previous trips Hygiene rules such as mandatory swimming caps didn't stop Ashton and Carter enjoying the pool The only time the pandemic brought the mood down was during the Osbornes' journey to their idyllic destination. The worst part was navigating the not-so-idyllic Luton Airport, which Ben describes as a ""nightmare"". He recalls only one shop was open - Boots - and that it was difficult to find any empty seats in the airport because so many were cordoned off. But the flight itself ""wasn't too bad"", he says. The family wore face coverings but did have to sit next to strangers, without any social distancing. The Osbornes have been to Lake Como before, and are enjoying the fact there are far fewer Brits than usual. ""We quite like to go away to experience different cultures, [so] what's really nice is I've not heard any English language,"" Ben says. He adds that it's a blessing to not have to queue for the supermarket, as we have grown used to in the UK. The only visible signs of the virus, to Ben, were people wearing face coverings in shops, and mandatory swimming caps in the pool. ""If someone had plonked us here and we didn't know about coronavirus, we wouldn't know the difference. You honestly wouldn't know that there's a pandemic."" Julie Grinter's friends told her she was ""completely mad"" for deciding to go ahead with her three-week holiday to Portugal, after the country failed to make it on to the UK government's quarantine-free list. But Julie, 50, points out that you could catch coronavirus in the supermarket at home, let alone on a plane. ""You can't stay inside for the rest of your life so you've got to take the precautions and get on with life,"" she says. The choice of destination might have horrified Julie's friends, but she and her partner Matthew Boulden, 52, felt extremely safe. After flying to Lisbon they went on a road trip to the Algarve and enjoyed being almost the only tourists, wherever they went. ""It's just absolutely deserted. There's just nobody there,"" says Julie, who works for a consultancy firm in the City of London. The couple ate out regularly, and while most dining was outside to help reduce the spread of the virus, Julie points out that the Portuguese climate meant that was never a problem. Impeccable service, high hygiene standards, free drinks from grateful waiters, and chats with less-than-busy chefs all added to the couple's feeling that they'd stumbled into a luxurious private dining experience. Restaurants owners on Julie's road trip told her they were struggling with a lack of customers Julie, who says many beaches were deserted, took this photo of the popular Praia da Rainha in Cascais Crowds at Praia da Rainha in Cascais, in the pre-coronavirus world of August 2016 But Julie from Surbiton, south-west London, admits the solitude wasn't always a relief. Tourism is a major industry in Portugal and is popular with British holidaymakers, with almost three million UK visitors a year. The restaurants often lacked ""a bit of atmosphere"", she says, adding that the staff were anxious for the future, and owners were ""hacked off"" and ""obviously devastated"" that their countrystill has not made it on to the UK's quarantine-free lists. ""You do feel massively sorry for them because they are just desperate for business,"" she says. Portugal's border is open to British citizens, but the UK government advisesagainst travel to most parts unless the trip is essential,external. On arrival to the mainland, travellers have to do a health screening, and those going to Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores must take a coronavirus test on arrival or before travelling. Cheap flights, deserted beaches and a free cocktail or two mean now that Julie is home, she's spending her 14 days of isolation persuading her previously horrified friends that Portugal is the place to be in a pandemic. ""If you can just work from home when you get back, it's ideal."" ForAdam Welch, a self-imposed month of minimal social contact at home in Kirkham, Lancashire, is the price he's paying for a five-night getaway to Croatia. The 18-year-old and three friends have formed a temporary household bubble at an Airbnb in Split. In order to reduce the chance of spreading the virus to one another, or to anyone else on their return to the UK, the friends agreed to minimise their social contact with anyone for 14 days before going away and 14 days after getting back. ""I just think it comes down to thinking of other people,"" Adam says. The pandemic led to exams and celebrations being cancelled in Adam's final year of college, so the sacrifice of semi-quarantine will be worth it to ""let my hair down"" on holiday, he says. ""If someone said to me at the start of the year, 'if you go on holiday you have to isolate for 14 days afterwards in your house', I'd be like: 'no way. I can't do that, it sounds so hard'. But now it just sounds easy."" So far in Split, the four friends have enjoyed eating out, going out for drinks, exploring the city, and snorkelling off picture-perfect beaches. People have to wear masks in shops and on public transport in Croatia but locals aren't observing social distancing at all, Adam says. While it's weird to see, he adds, it's a nice break from the rules and regulations in place in the UK. Adam Welch says he's happy to give up Croatia's nightclubs in favour of its beaches In the hiatus between finishing college and starting university in York in September, Adam admits he's tempted by Croatia's nightclubs, which are open albeit with some additional cleaning measures to combat the spread of the virus. But Adam says the ""lads' holiday"" will be a more muted affair than it would have been in normal times. ""At the end of the day, we're in a nice apartment, we can just get some drinks from a shop and stuff like that, and chill out with each other. We can definitely have a really good time and we don't have to go clubbing.""

Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

'Catastrophic' Hurricane Laura lashes Louisiana,"This video can not be played Hurricane Laura left a trail of destruction in Louisiana and Texas At least six people have been killed as Hurricane Laura battered the US state of Louisiana. Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant. But the feared 20ft (6m) storm surge was avoided as the hurricane, the state's biggest, tracked further east. Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status. It has since crossed into Arkansas. At 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Thursdaythe National Hurricane Center said the storm had weakened to maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h),external, but was still bringing heavy rainfall. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state ""did not sustain and suffer the absolute, catastrophic damage that we thought was likely,"" but stressed they had still suffered ""a tremendous amount of damage"" and warned people to remain vigilant.

It was very big and very powerful but it passed quickly.""  The president will visit the states affected at the weekend. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier swept across the Caribbean, killing 24 people. At least six people are known to have died after the storm crashed into the US, Gov Edwards told reporters. Of those, four were killed by falling trees. One man drowned in a boat that sank and another died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in his home, authorities said. Residents were told to stay indoors as a ""chemical fire"" was tackled near Lake Charles There was more structural damage from winds than anticipated, but the water damage was less than feared. Nearly 900,000 homes and businesses lost power as the storm hit the US. A barge had collided with a bridge in the city of Lake Charles, quite close to where a suspected ""chlorine chemical fire"" at an industrial plant was being attended by emergency services. More than half a million homes in Louisiana were reported to be without power Mr Edwards said people should stay off the roads where possible, as outer bands of the storm were still causing high water levels and winds. Some 1,500 people, including National Guard troops, are being deployed in rescue and clean-up missions. Vice-President Mike Pence, who joined Mr Trump at Fema, said: ""While this was a major storm with devastating impact it was not as bad as it could have been."" It was one of the strongest to ever hit the US Gulf Coast, striking as a category four with winds of up to 150mph (240km/h). Governor Edwards said it was even more powerful than Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people.

Switzerland latest to join UK's quarantine list,"Tourists wearing face coverings visit Switzerland's Matterhorn mountain Travellers to Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic who return to the UK from 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. The UK government said the move was needed to keep UK infection rates down. People arriving in Scotland from Switzerlandare already required to self-isolate. Cuba,where there has been a drop in cases,will be added to the list of destinations people can return from without entering quarantine. The UK considers imposing quarantine conditions when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The government saidthere has been a ""consistent increase"" in the weekly case rate in Switzerland,externalover the past four weeks, with cases per 100,000 rising from 18.5 to 22 over the past week. In Jamaica, the seven-day rate rose from 4.3 on August 20 to 20.8 on Thursday - a 382% increase, while the Czech Republic has seen weekly cases per 100,000 rise from 16.2 on 20 August to 20.2 on Thursday. More than 1.6 million Britons travelled to Switzerland last year, the Swiss Tourism Federation said, drawn by the Alps and the mountain air. The Czech Republic sees more than 300,000 British tourists every year, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The capital Prague is a popular destination for city breaks and stag parties. Katarina Hobbs, director of CzechTourism UK and Ireland, insists the country ""remains a safe country to travel to"", adding she hoped the British government would reconsider its decision ""very soon"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) The Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential travel to the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland. UK tourists in those countries are being told to follow local rules and check the FCO travel advice. In a tweet,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned British holidaymakers to ""only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14-day quarantine on return"". People wishing to avoid the need to self-isolate now face a race to get back to the UK before the quarantine deadline. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, told the BBC fares ""went through the roof"" within minutes of No 10's announcement, with airlines including British Airways adding extra flights to Heathrow from Prague, Geneva and Zurich priced at about ""Â£300 one way"". He alsowrote in the Independent,external, that a ""significant number"" of UK tourists with family connections to Jamaica were understood to be on the Caribbean island but warned it might be too late for them to return by Saturday's deadline if they missed Thursday's overnight flights - which go through America. He advised travellers leaving Switzerland to avoid flying via Basel airport as its terminal and runway sat inside French territory, and, according to the DfT, would trigger the need to quarantine. Liechtenstein is now also off-limits, he added, because it is only accessible through Switzerland and Austria - which is also on the government's quarantine list. The Czech Republic loosened its lockdown restrictions in July In July,thousands of guests sat at a 500 metre-long (1,640ft) table on the Charles Bridgein Prague at a party held to give the coronavirus a ""symbolic farewell"". The event's organiser said the celebration in the Czech capital was made possible by a lack of tourists in the city. In Switzerland, a state of emergency was declared in March, with the government ordering the closure of schools, restaurants, bars and all the ski slopes. But by June,as cases of Covid-19 started to fall across Europe and more travel was permitted, it reopened its mountain railwaysand cable cars. Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? France added to UK quarantine countries You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Tom Brodie, who lives in the Rhone Valley in Switzerland, set up his own adventure travel business in January before coronavirus restrictions ""decimated"" his summer season and he had to refund his bookings. Mr Brodie, originally from Birkenhead, Wirral, recently re-launched Alps Adventures - which gets most of its business from the UK - but now fears people will cancel their winter bookings if Switzerland remains on the quarantine list. He says he is trying to see the ""silver linings"", including flights being cheaper in the winter, but admits it will be ""very tough"" as no-one will want to book flights now. Meanwhile, Julian Griffiths is driving back from Switzerland, where he lives, a week earlier than planned to get his daughter back to the UK for the start of the new school term. He questioned whether he was more at risk of catching coronavirus in Switzerland than in the UK. ""I think the number of cases is based on the level of testing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""When I had a test for Covid, I just went to my local doctor's, he did the test, gave me the results 10 minutes later, and it's the same for anybody in Switzerland."" Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately, but the DfT said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Wales has made one further change - adding Singapore to its list of exemptions. Gibraltar remains on the UK's quarantine exemption list despiteconcern about a rising number of Covid cases. Last week restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal but added for travellers coming back fromCroatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. In July, travellers returning to theUK from Spain were caught out by the government's decision to advise against all but non-essential travelto the mainland and islands after a spike in cases in the country. And two weeks ago,visitors to France were given a few days' notice that they would face a quarantineon their return home to the UK. On their own, the three latest countries to join the UK's quarantine list won't affect a huge number of people. But over the past month, the government has scrapped so-called travel corridors - meaning people don't have to self-isolate - with at least 18 countries and territories, including key tourist destinations like France and Spain. Ministers say this cautious approach will prevent cases of the virus being imported. However, travel companies are frustrated that the UK hasn't yet followed countries like France and Germany and set-up a testing regime for passengers arriving from ""at risk"" countries, so that people who test negative can leave quarantine early. The UK government is said to be considering a two-test regime whereby passengers would test on arrival and then go into quarantine for eight days until a second test. Two negative results would mean they would avoid the remaining six days of quarantine. Figures within the aviation sector say that approach is too cautious and would do little to kick-start foreign travel. There has been widespread criticism of the government's weekly reviews of travel restrictions. The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, said many holidaymakers found themselves ""held to ransom"" by airlines when trying to purchase new flights to beat the quarantine deadlines. He called for greater transparency from the government so people had the necessary information in advance to decide whether it was safe to travel. ""Struggling tour operators can offer them trips to alternative destinations, rather than facing the financial hit of yet more cancellations and refund pay-outs,"" he added. Meanwhile, airport operator the Manchester Airport Group has called for an end to the UK's ""sluggish, illogical and chaotic"" approach to quarantine. Its chief strategy officer, Tim Hawkins, said: ""These decisions aren't being made anywhere near quick enough"". The Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (Abta) warned the travel sector would ""continue to suffer"" for as long as quarantine remains the government's ""principal strategy"" in containing the virus. A spokesperson said it was ""vital"" for the government to ""assess risk on a regionalised"" basis - allowing travel to areas in a country unaffected by a spike in cases - rather than a blanket one, in order to minimise the impact on the sector and consumer confidence.

The world's deadliest storms,"As we enter hurricane season, when there is a greater chance of more powerful storms developing in the Atlantic, here is a guide to how deadly storms form, how they are measured and why they happen where they do. Hurricanes are the biggest and most violent storms on the planet. Every year, between June and November they hit the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States, sometimes leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. In the Pacific Ocean, they are known as cyclones. In the Indian Ocean and southern Pacific, they are known as typhoons. They are all tropical storms, but they are only called hurricanes in the north Atlantic and north-eastern Pacific. Most hurricanes that form in the Atlantic are the result of an atmospheric phenomenon known as a tropical wave. The wave starts as a type of atmospheric trough that creates an area of relatively low air pressure - usually in western Africa, in mid-July. If the conditions are right for it to develop, the low pressure starts to move west, with the help of the trade winds or easterlies. When it reaches the Atlantic, the tropical wave has the potential to become a hurricane - but for this to happen it needs enough energy in the form of heat and wind. In fact, it needs a deep layer of warm water, with a surface water temperature above 27C. It also needs the right winds - horizontally swirling winds to concentrate the storm and a weak vertical wind shear rising from the surface of the sea. If the wind shear changes too much as it rises, it can disrupt the flow of heat and humidity needed to create the hurricane. The final ingredient is a concentration of rain clouds and high humidity in the area. This all needs to happen in the right place - generally between 10 and 30 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere, where the rotation of the Earth helps the winds converge and rise in the area of low pressure. When a tropical wave encounters all these elements, they all start to interact over an area between 50km (31 miles) and 100km wide. ""The movement of the tropical wave is a trigger for the storm,"" says Jorge Zaval Hidalgo, general co-ordinator of Mexico's National Weather Service. The storm is the catalyst - and the dance of heat, air and water begins. The area of low pressure cools the humid, warm air rising from the ocean, which fills the clouds. The condensation of this air releases heat, which lowers the pressure even more, drawing more humidity from the ocean and the storm builds. The winds converge and rise within the area of low pressure, spinning counter clockwise, giving the hurricane its trademark shape. While the storm becomes more powerful, the eye of the hurricane - the central area about 30-60km wide on average - remains relatively calm. Around it, rises the eye wall of dense clouds and most intense winds. Beyond that are the spiral bands of cloud, where there is the most rain. The wind speeds are what determine the moment at which we can call this phenomenon a hurricane. At its birth, it is a tropical depression. As it gathers strength, it becomes a tropical storm. When speeds reach more than 118km an hour, it is a hurricane. However, hurricanes can be classified in five categories depending on the sustained wind speeds. In the Atlantic, the Saffir-Simpson wind scale is used to measure their destructive power. One hurricane's winds can produce about half as much energy as the electrical generating capacity of the entire world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, it is not the winds that cause the most destruction and loss of life, but the storm surge and flooding caused by the hurricane's rain. In the United States, for example, the storm surge caused by tropical cyclones in the Atlantic were responsible for nearly half of hurricane-related deaths between 1963 and 2012, according to the American Meteorological Society. The level of destruction caused by a hurricane is also going to depend on other circumstances, such as the speed at which it hits, the terrain and local infrastructure in the affected area. ""The damage or danger associated with a tropical cyclone does not necessarily correspond to its category. For example, the highest level storm will not necessarily mean more rain,"" Mr Hidalgo told the BBC. Here is a recap: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds.

Why storms are intensifying,"The biggest and most damaging hurricanes are now three times more frequent than they were 100 years ago, say researchers. Using a new method of calculating the destruction, the scientists say the increase in frequency is ""unequivocal"". Previous attempts to isolate the impact of climate change on hurricanes have often came up with conflicting results. But the new study says the increase in damage caused by these big cyclones is linked by global warming. BA reviews 'fuel-tankering' over climate concerns Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Sea ice loss linked to spread of deadly virus Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was estimated to be $125bn, roughly 1% of US GDP. This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker takes a look at the formation of Cape Verde-type hurricanes and where their energy comes from. One of the big questions that scientists have wrestled with is how to compare storm events from different eras. Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier? Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage in Florida, but also in Antigua and Barbuda Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency. However this new paper challenges that view. Instead of looking at economic damage, the authors looked at the amount of land that was totally destroyed by more than 240 storms between 1900 and 2018, based on insurance industry databases. As an example, the researchers examined Hurricane Irma that hit Florida in 2017. Around 1.1 million people were living inside the 10,000 sq km closest to the storm's landfall. Hurricane Dorian sparked an emergency in Florida in September With the wealth per capita estimated to be $194,000, the scientists concluded that the overall wealth in this 10,000 sq km region was $215bn. As the storm caused $50bn worth of damage, this was 23% of the wealth in the region. Taking 23% of the 10,000 sq km gave an area of total destruction of 2,300 sq km. By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons in terms of damage over the decades. Hurricanes are one of the most destructive weather events on the planet The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century. And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures. ""Our data reveal an emergent positive trend in damage which we attribute to a detectable change in extreme storms due to global warming,"" they write. This video can not be played What is global warming? The scientists involved believe their new method is solid and gives a more accurate picture of what is happening with the worst storms. ""The new method of looking at the frequencies is really robust,"" said Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the study. ""The increase in frequency is not only in my own dataset but is also present in other datasets, so it is extremely robust, and I think that will help it become more accepted.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsSwitzerland latest to join UK's quarantine listTravellers in Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic must quarantine on return to the UK from 0400 on SaturdayUK","Tourists wearing face coverings visit Switzerland's Matterhorn mountain Travellers to Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic who return to the UK from 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. The UK government said the move was needed to keep UK infection rates down. People arriving in Scotland from Switzerlandare already required to self-isolate. Cuba,where there has been a drop in cases,will be added to the list of destinations people can return from without entering quarantine. The UK considers imposing quarantine conditions when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The government saidthere has been a ""consistent increase"" in the weekly case rate in Switzerland,externalover the past four weeks, with cases per 100,000 rising from 18.5 to 22 over the past week. In Jamaica, the seven-day rate rose from 4.3 on August 20 to 20.8 on Thursday - a 382% increase, while the Czech Republic has seen weekly cases per 100,000 rise from 16.2 on 20 August to 20.2 on Thursday. More than 1.6 million Britons travelled to Switzerland last year, the Swiss Tourism Federation said, drawn by the Alps and the mountain air. The Czech Republic sees more than 300,000 British tourists every year, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The capital Prague is a popular destination for city breaks and stag parties. Katarina Hobbs, director of CzechTourism UK and Ireland, insists the country ""remains a safe country to travel to"", adding she hoped the British government would reconsider its decision ""very soon"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) The Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential travel to the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland. UK tourists in those countries are being told to follow local rules and check the FCO travel advice. In a tweet,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned British holidaymakers to ""only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14-day quarantine on return"". People wishing to avoid the need to self-isolate now face a race to get back to the UK before the quarantine deadline. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, told the BBC fares ""went through the roof"" within minutes of No 10's announcement, with airlines including British Airways adding extra flights to Heathrow from Prague, Geneva and Zurich priced at about ""Â£300 one way"". He alsowrote in the Independent,external, that a ""significant number"" of UK tourists with family connections to Jamaica were understood to be on the Caribbean island but warned it might be too late for them to return by Saturday's deadline if they missed Thursday's overnight flights - which go through America. He advised travellers leaving Switzerland to avoid flying via Basel airport as its terminal and runway sat inside French territory, and, according to the DfT, would trigger the need to quarantine. Liechtenstein is now also off-limits, he added, because it is only accessible through Switzerland and Austria - which is also on the government's quarantine list. The Czech Republic loosened its lockdown restrictions in July In July,thousands of guests sat at a 500 metre-long (1,640ft) table on the Charles Bridgein Prague at a party held to give the coronavirus a ""symbolic farewell"". The event's organiser said the celebration in the Czech capital was made possible by a lack of tourists in the city. In Switzerland, a state of emergency was declared in March, with the government ordering the closure of schools, restaurants, bars and all the ski slopes. But by June,as cases of Covid-19 started to fall across Europe and more travel was permitted, it reopened its mountain railwaysand cable cars. Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? France added to UK quarantine countries You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Tom Brodie, who lives in the Rhone Valley in Switzerland, set up his own adventure travel business in January before coronavirus restrictions ""decimated"" his summer season and he had to refund his bookings. Mr Brodie, originally from Birkenhead, Wirral, recently re-launched Alps Adventures - which gets most of its business from the UK - but now fears people will cancel their winter bookings if Switzerland remains on the quarantine list. He says he is trying to see the ""silver linings"", including flights being cheaper in the winter, but admits it will be ""very tough"" as no-one will want to book flights now. Meanwhile, Julian Griffiths is driving back from Switzerland, where he lives, a week earlier than planned to get his daughter back to the UK for the start of the new school term. He questioned whether he was more at risk of catching coronavirus in Switzerland than in the UK. ""I think the number of cases is based on the level of testing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""When I had a test for Covid, I just went to my local doctor's, he did the test, gave me the results 10 minutes later, and it's the same for anybody in Switzerland."" Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately, but the DfT said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Wales has made one further change - adding Singapore to its list of exemptions. Gibraltar remains on the UK's quarantine exemption list despiteconcern about a rising number of Covid cases. Last week restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal but added for travellers coming back fromCroatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. In July, travellers returning to theUK from Spain were caught out by the government's decision to advise against all but non-essential travelto the mainland and islands after a spike in cases in the country. And two weeks ago,visitors to France were given a few days' notice that they would face a quarantineon their return home to the UK. On their own, the three latest countries to join the UK's quarantine list won't affect a huge number of people. But over the past month, the government has scrapped so-called travel corridors - meaning people don't have to self-isolate - with at least 18 countries and territories, including key tourist destinations like France and Spain. Ministers say this cautious approach will prevent cases of the virus being imported. However, travel companies are frustrated that the UK hasn't yet followed countries like France and Germany and set-up a testing regime for passengers arriving from ""at risk"" countries, so that people who test negative can leave quarantine early. The UK government is said to be considering a two-test regime whereby passengers would test on arrival and then go into quarantine for eight days until a second test. Two negative results would mean they would avoid the remaining six days of quarantine. Figures within the aviation sector say that approach is too cautious and would do little to kick-start foreign travel. There has been widespread criticism of the government's weekly reviews of travel restrictions. The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, said many holidaymakers found themselves ""held to ransom"" by airlines when trying to purchase new flights to beat the quarantine deadlines. He called for greater transparency from the government so people had the necessary information in advance to decide whether it was safe to travel. ""Struggling tour operators can offer them trips to alternative destinations, rather than facing the financial hit of yet more cancellations and refund pay-outs,"" he added. Meanwhile, airport operator the Manchester Airport Group has called for an end to the UK's ""sluggish, illogical and chaotic"" approach to quarantine. Its chief strategy officer, Tim Hawkins, said: ""These decisions aren't being made anywhere near quick enough"". The Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (Abta) warned the travel sector would ""continue to suffer"" for as long as quarantine remains the government's ""principal strategy"" in containing the virus. A spokesperson said it was ""vital"" for the government to ""assess risk on a regionalised"" basis - allowing travel to areas in a country unaffected by a spike in cases - rather than a blanket one, in order to minimise the impact on the sector and consumer confidence.

Switzerland travellers could face UK quarantineScotland already requires people arriving from the country to self-isolate for 14 days.UK Politics,"Travellers returning to the UK from Switzerland could have to self-isolate, if the government decides to remove the country fromits quarantine exemption list.,external The Czech Republic and Jamaica could also lose their exempt status, while Cuba could be added to the safe list in some parts of the UK. UK ministers are meeting later to discuss any changes. There is also concern about a rising number of Covid cases in Gibraltar. However it is understood that the island has successfully lobbied to avoid being added to the quarantine measures for at least another week, says the BBC's Nick Eardley. The requirement to quarantine for 14 days has already been applied to people coming from Switzerland to Scotland. It follows a rise in infections in the country. Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece? Quarantine rules lifted for Portugal travel The UK considers imposing quarantine conditions when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Switzerland is currently over that threshold, with a seven-day rate of 21.2. Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately but restrictions imposed in England following the ministers' meeting are also likely to be adopted by Wales and Northern Ireland. Swiss Tourism Federation director Barbara Gisi has said with over 1.6 million Britons travelling to the country last year, the UK is the third largest foreign market for Switzerland. ""Swiss tourism cannot afford to do without guests from abroad in the long term,"" she said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo said cases appeared to be rising in the territory because they were doing more testing than most other places. He said they had been ""very successful at identifying cases of the virus and exercising controls in terms of imposing self-isolation"". ""We have no-one in hospital, we have no-one in ICU, we have had no-one die from the virus."" He said imposing quarantine rules would be ""a huge inconvenience"" not just to tourists but also people travelling to Gibraltar for work and study. But a decision on changing the island's status in unlikely to be made this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Department for Transport introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for some arrivals from overseas in early June. In the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then the governments have regularly updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK. Around 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia last year Last week quarantine restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal, but added for travellers coming back from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Â£480 in Scotland, and there are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders.

Manhunt after father âabducts sons in foster careâPolice said Imran Safi threatened the foster carer with a knife and took the boys aged three to six.London,"Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen Safi are said to have been taken from their foster home An urgent manhunt is under way for a father who abducted his three sons from their foster home, police have said. Imran Safi, 26, is said to have threatened a foster carer with a knife in Coulsdon, south London, last Thursday. He is accused of taking Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen - aged six, five and three. An image of Mr Safi has been circulated to all ports and borders amid concerns he may attempt to take the boys abroad. All three brothers were playing in the garden while their foster carer was inside the house on Coulsdon Road when they were taken, detectives said. The foster carer, who told officers that Safi threatened her with a knife, did not suffer any serious physical injuries but was ""understandably distressed"". It is understood that the boys were due to be formally adopted, a fact detectives believe could have been a motivation for the abduction. Mr Safi was not thought to have access to the boys' passports. Imran Safi is said to be in possession of a knife, the Met said Metropolitan Police Commander Jon Savell said the boys had ""been in social care services for some while"" and their natural family had become aware they were going to be adopted. He added that Mr Safi was not allowed to go to the foster carer's address and had ""taken the law into his own hands"" by doing so. Mr Savell said it was ""an absolute priority"" to find the three children and more than 100 officers were working to locate them. ""They have been taken from a place of safety and we are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, particularly as we remain in the midst of a global health crisis,"" he said. ""While we do not believe at this time there is any immediate risk to their physical safety, their location, access to accommodation, healthcare, and other provisions is entirely unknown."" ""We are concerned about the longer-term impact of this on all three children. ""An intense investigation into how this abduction was planned and carried out is being led by detectives in south London, alongside a manhunt being led by specialist detectives within the Met."" Eight people aged between 17 and 37 have been arrested in connection with the abduction. They were all arrested in Croydon and have been bailed to a later date, the Met said. A red Nissan Qashqai, with the registration PK13 WFO, is thought to have been involved in the abduction. Police are appealing for any dashcam footage which shows the car believed to be linked to Imran Safi By Home Affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Police are struggling with this case. The usual tactics of CCTV, automatic number plate cameras, and tracking mobile phone usage have not worked. The getaway car was found in the area. It is possible the father may have switched vehicles. The first thing they did was to inform airports and sea ports. Now they are worried an attempt will be made to smuggle the children abroad - a traumatic experience for such young boys. It may already have happened. Ch Supt Dave Stringer urged witnesses who knew about the children's whereabouts to come forward Mr Safi is an Afghan national and has links to Pakistan but police do not yet know if he has travelled overseas. Detectives are working closely with national and international agencies to ensure any movement into foreign countries is identified. Ch Supt Dave Stringer said that the incident would ""understandably send a shock"" to the local Croydon community. ""We know there are people with detailed knowledge of the whereabouts of these children, and we fully appreciate there may be very good reasons for those individuals not wanting to come forward,"" he said. ""But right now I would strongly urge them to do the right thing and assist us in locating them."" Croydon Council declined to comment due to the ""active police investigation"".

Low-paid workers to get Â£13 a day to self-isolateThe benefit will be trialled in some parts of north-west England where coronavirus cases have risen.UK,"The payment will only be available for people who claim benefits Workers on low incomes in parts of England where there are high rates of coronavirus will be able to claim up to Â£182 if they have to self-isolate. From Tuesday, those who claim Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit and cannot work from home will be able to get the money  - equal to Â£13 a day. The benefit will be trialled in parts of north-west England first. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the payment ""goes nowhere near far enough"", adding people need ""full pay"". Employed or self-employed people who test positive for the virus are required to isolate for 10 days, so those eligible for the extra money will get Â£130. But members of the household of someone who has tested positive, who must self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to up to Â£182, assuming they also qualify for the payment. Anyone else who is told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers and meets the qualification criteria will also be entitled to Â£13 a day -about the same as statutory sick pay,external- for however long they must self-isolate. The payment, announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, applies to benefit claimants who live in areas where there are high numbers of coronavirus cases. It comes as the government saida further 12 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,external, taking the total number of virus-related deaths to 41,477. There were a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of 09:00 BST on Thursday, up from 1,048 cases a day earlier. The overall number of people to have tested positive is now 330,368. The scheme will be trialled in Blackburn and other parts of north-west England The England-wide scheme will begin with a trial in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham, wherethere have been tighter lockdown measures after a rise in cases. If the payment is successful it will be ""quickly"" rolled out to other areas where there are lots of cases, the Department of Health said. 'No socialising' rules in parts of North West Commuter towns see sharp rise in benefit claims According to data published earlier this month,nearly 5.5 million people across the UK are now claiming benefits - an 81% increase since March. ""Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks,"" said Mr Hancock. He said the payments had been introduced after feedback from England's contact tracing programme, NHS Test and Trace, and would mean people ""don't lose out by doing the right thing"". ""The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus,"" said Mr Hancock The health secretary told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". Latest figures,externalfor the week to 19 August suggest 72% of people who tested positive were reached by NHS Test and Trace. Those people provided details of more than 24,000 close contacts and just over 75% of those were reached. Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 The data also showed turnaround times for coronavirus tests has increased, with the average wait for results now more than 24 hours for those done at mobile units and testing centres. The government said the rising number of tests being done had created a backlog, which the service was working hard to catch up on. England's NHS Test and Trace service is now three months old - plenty of time to get established and to be judged on. So how is it doing? The key goal was to achieve reach 80% of people who test positive and 80% of their contacts. It has consistently fallen short of that - but only just. Another target is to ensure test results are processed quickly. The fact those waits are getting longer is concerning. The initial design of the service also looks questionable with too much emphasis on the national contact tracing unit rather than local teams. That is now in the process of being rectified with councils establishing their own dedicated tracing teams. But, at the end of the day, the true test of the service - and the wider government's response for that matter - is whether the virus is contained. There have been some signs of an increase in infections in recent weeks - although part of that is likely to be down to extra testing as the more the look the more you find. And if you look at our near neighbours, such as France and Spain, the UK seems to be doing well. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is things could certainly be worse. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had been ""calling for weeks"" for the government to provide financial support for those asked to self-isolate. ""I am pleased they have at last acknowledged this issue but am sorry to say this move goes nowhere near far enough."" ""The health secretary has already said that he couldn't live on Statutory Sick Pay at Â£95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?"" He added that it would not provide the support many workers in Greater Manchester needed to co-operate with NHS Test and Trace and called for the government to enable people ""to self-isolate on full pay"". Mohammed Iqbal, Labour leader of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while financial support was welcome, Â£13 a day was ""a slap in the face"". ""I've spoken to people who have tested positive who I have persuaded to stay home and the kick back from them is to say... 'who is going to put food on the table for my wife and children?', and that is a question we have been pushing back to government for a few weeks now,"" he said. 'This food bank is a lifesaver to me' People will need to provide evidence - including, for example, proof of a positive test, a message from NHS Test and Trace and a bank statement - and the money will be provided within 48 hours, the government said. Mr Hancock said the aim was to get money to people quickly - at the start of their isolation ""rather than afterwards"". The government said checks will be undertaken to make sure people who apply are unable to work from home. The payment will not reduce any other benefits that a person may already receive. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government had encouraged UK ministers to put support in place - but that more detail was needed about how it would be introduced. ""It seems to me to make sense for [payments] to be administered through existing welfare or benefits systems, and obviously we are seeking to understand what the financial consequential position is for the Scottish government,"" she said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Universal Credit payments have been increased by Â£20 a week for the period between April 2020 and March 2021 due to the pandemic, but Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected calls from campaigners to also scrap the benefits cap for the same duration. The benefit cap limits how much any one household can receive in benefits. In other news: Police in England and Wales have seen a 31% rise in assaults on emergency services workers in the four weeks to 2 August, compared to the same period last year. Martin Hewitt chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council said he was ""disgusted"" by the increase at a time when emergency services were on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic The number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England fell slightly in the week to 19 August, down to 6,115 from 6,656 the week before. But it is still the second highest weekly figure since mid-June No new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. It comes after the first deaths following a positive test in the nation for six weeks wereannounced on Wednesday The take up of the flu jab among people in vulnerable groups has declined, according to BBC analysis, despite plans to double the number of people who receive it.

"SA conservationist killed by his own white lionsPolice say two lions attacked the lodge owner as he was taking them for a walk, in front of his wife.Africa","West Mathewson had known the lionesses since they were cubs A well-known South African conservationist has died after he was mauled by two white lions as he was taking them for a walk. The wife of West Mathewson, who followed in a car, tried to distract the lions but it was too late. He ran a popular safari lodge, Lion Tree Top Lodge, in Limpopo province. The lionesses have since been moved to another game lodge and are expected to be released into the wild at a later stage. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories What are the world's deadliest animals? A lioness became aggressive towards the other and then turned her attention to the conservationist affectionately known as ""Uncle West"", reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko from Johannesburg. His relatives have said that Wednesday's attack could have been the result of very rough play. The lionesses were tranquillised following the attack and have been taken to an endangered species centre. Mr Mathewson is said to have rescued the lions from ""canned hunting"" - when animals are hunted in an enclosed area, or they are bred to be hunted - and they were kept in an enclosure at his lodge. The lionesses reportedly killed a man working on a neighbouring property after they broke out of the enclosure in 2017. This video can not be played Are people hunting 'canned lions' in South Africa?

Switzerland travellers could face UK quarantine,"Travellers returning to the UK from Switzerland could have to self-isolate, if the government decides to remove the country fromits quarantine exemption list.,external The Czech Republic and Jamaica could also lose their exempt status, while Cuba could be added to the safe list in some parts of the UK. UK ministers are meeting later to discuss any changes. There is also concern about a rising number of Covid cases in Gibraltar. However it is understood that the island has successfully lobbied to avoid being added to the quarantine measures for at least another week, says the BBC's Nick Eardley. The requirement to quarantine for 14 days has already been applied to people coming from Switzerland to Scotland. It follows a rise in infections in the country. Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece? Quarantine rules lifted for Portugal travel The UK considers imposing quarantine conditions when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Switzerland is currently over that threshold, with a seven-day rate of 21.2. Quarantine rules are set by each UK nation separately but restrictions imposed in England following the ministers' meeting are also likely to be adopted by Wales and Northern Ireland. Swiss Tourism Federation director Barbara Gisi has said with over 1.6 million Britons travelling to the country last year, the UK is the third largest foreign market for Switzerland. ""Swiss tourism cannot afford to do without guests from abroad in the long term,"" she said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo said cases appeared to be rising in the territory because they were doing more testing than most other places. He said they had been ""very successful at identifying cases of the virus and exercising controls in terms of imposing self-isolation"". ""We have no-one in hospital, we have no-one in ICU, we have had no-one die from the virus."" He said imposing quarantine rules would be ""a huge inconvenience"" not just to tourists but also people travelling to Gibraltar for work and study. But a decision on changing the island's status in unlikely to be made this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Department for Transport introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for some arrivals from overseas in early June. In the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of ""travel corridors"", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule. Since then the governments have regularly updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK. Around 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia last year Last week quarantine restrictions were lifted on those returning from Portugal, but added for travellers coming back from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Â£480 in Scotland, and there are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders.

Manhunt after father âabducts boys in foster careâ,"Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen Safi are said to have been taken from their foster home An urgent manhunt is under way for a father who abducted his three sons from their foster home, police have said. Imran Safi, 26, is said to have threatened a foster carer with a knife in Coulsdon, south London, last Thursday. He is accused of taking Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen - aged six, five and three. An image of Mr Safi has been circulated to all ports and borders amid concerns he may attempt to take the boys abroad. All three brothers were playing in the garden while their foster carer was inside the house on Coulsdon Road when they were taken, detectives said. The foster carer, who told officers that Safi threatened her with a knife, did not suffer any serious physical injuries but was ""understandably distressed"". It is understood that the boys were due to be formally adopted, a fact detectives believe could have been a motivation for the abduction. Mr Safi was not thought to have access to the boys' passports. Imran Safi is said to be in possession of a knife, the Met said Metropolitan Police Commander Jon Savell said the boys had ""been in social care services for some while"" and their natural family had become aware they were going to be adopted. He added that Mr Safi was not allowed to go to the foster carer's address and had ""taken the law into his own hands"" by doing so. Mr Savell said it was ""an absolute priority"" to find the three children and more than 100 officers were working to locate them. ""They have been taken from a place of safety and we are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, particularly as we remain in the midst of a global health crisis,"" he said. ""While we do not believe at this time there is any immediate risk to their physical safety, their location, access to accommodation, healthcare, and other provisions is entirely unknown."" ""We are concerned about the longer-term impact of this on all three children. ""An intense investigation into how this abduction was planned and carried out is being led by detectives in south London, alongside a manhunt being led by specialist detectives within the Met."" Eight people aged between 17 and 37 have been arrested in connection with the abduction. They were all arrested in Croydon and have been bailed to a later date, the Met said. A red Nissan Qashqai, with the registration PK13 WFO, is thought to have been involved in the abduction. Police are appealing for any dashcam footage which shows the car believed to be linked to Imran Safi By Home Affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Police are struggling with this case. The usual tactics of CCTV, automatic number plate cameras, and tracking mobile phone usage have not worked. The getaway car was found in the area. It is possible the father may have switched vehicles. The first thing they did was to inform airports and sea ports. Now they are worried an attempt will be made to smuggle the children abroad - a traumatic experience for such young boys. It may already have happened. Ch Supt Dave Stringer urged witnesses who knew about the children's whereabouts to come forward Mr Safi is an Afghan national and has links to Pakistan but police do not yet know if he has travelled overseas. Detectives are working closely with national and international agencies to ensure any movement into foreign countries is identified. Ch Supt Dave Stringer said that the incident would ""understandably send a shock"" to the local Croydon community. ""We know there are people with detailed knowledge of the whereabouts of these children, and we fully appreciate there may be very good reasons for those individuals not wanting to come forward,"" he said. ""But right now I would strongly urge them to do the right thing and assist us in locating them."" Croydon Council declined to comment due to the ""active police investigation"".

"Christchurch killer to stay in jail until he diesThe judge called the actions of a man who murdered 51 people last year in two mosques ""inhuman"".Asia","The victims of the Christchurch massacre A white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand will serve life in jail without parole - the first person in the country's history to receive the sentence. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 29, admitted to the murder of 51 people, attempted murder of another 40 people and one charge of terrorism. The judge called Tarrant's actions ""inhuman"", saying he ""showed no mercy"". The attack last March, which was livestreamed, shocked the world. Tarrant's sentencing also marks the first terrorism conviction in New Zealand's history. ""Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,"" said Judge Cameron Mander in a Christchurch court on Thursday. On imposing a sentence of life without parole, Justice Mander said: ""If not here, then when?"" A sentence without parole means the offender will not be given the opportunity to leave prison after serving only a portion of their total sentence. Justice Mander said such life sentences without parole were reserved only for the ""very worst murders"". New Zealand does not have the death penalty as part of its justice system. Justice Mander had harsh words for Tarrant in his sentencing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, upon hearing of Tarrant's sentencing, said it meant he would have ""no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again"". ""Today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist,"" she said. The shootings prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners. On the last day of a four-day sentencing hearing, Justice Mander spent almost an hour reminding Tarrant of each person he killed and injured. He added that despite the gunman's guilty pleas, the gunman appeared ""neither contrite nor ashamed"". Tarrant, who said through a lawyer in court that he did not oppose the prosecution's application for a life without parole sentence, did not react to the sentence. He had earlier also refused the right to speak at his sentencing. The sentencing hearing began on Monday, with a large part of the first three days dedicated to hearing victim impact statements. Tarrant appeared largely emotionless over the past three days, as almost 90 victims - some grieving, others defiant - confronted him. This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, speaks in court Sara Qasem, whose father Abdelfattah Qasem died at the Al Noor Mosque, spoke of the last moments of his death, saying: ""I wonder if he was in pain, if he was frightened, and what his final thoughts were. And I wish more than anything in the world that I could have been there to hold his hand and tell him it would all be OK."" She struggled to hold back her tears, before looking at Tarrant and saying ""these tears are not for you"". Ahmed Wali Khan, who lost his uncle in the attacks, told the BBC that the Muslim community in Christchurch welcomed the verdict. ""Everyone was quite happy that justice has been served,"" he said, adding that the community had been ""waiting for this decision for a very long time"". Taj Kamran, an Afghan refugee who was shot several times in the leg and still requires walking aids, said he would ""be able to sleep"" after the verdict, though it would not return those who were lost. ""No punishment is going to bring our loved ones back and our sadness will continue for the rest of our lives,"" he told the AFP news agency. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Irfan Yunianto, a doctoral student from Indonesia who survived the shootings, said he was relieved that the gunman had finally been sentenced. ""I was at the shooting location. Many of my friends died. I also saw with my own eyes how my friends were trying to save the victims,"" he said. ""I accept the court decision with good grace,"" he added. ""Following this trial has been really hard, but I still watched it online. After the verdict was reached I felt so relieved because the court finally delivered its final verdict."" Tarrant received the maximum possible sentence in New Zealand, which does not have the death penalty. ""We are not in a country where we can expect the death penalty. But they have served justice, giving the maximum prison time without parole,"" said Hina Amir, 34, who was outside Al Noor mosque when Tarrant began his attack. The gunman opened fire on two mosques in the city on 15 March last year. He first targeted worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque. Less than 30 seconds later, he returned to his car to pick up another weapon and then re-entered the mosque and resumed firing on those inside. The entire incident was broadcast on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot two people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. Two police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, he told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his attack and he wished he had done so. During this week's sentencing, the court heard that the gunman planned to target another mosque but was detained by officers on the way. The 29-year-old white supremacist has been described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing terrorist"". He was born in the Australian state of New South Wales to a father who was a garbage collector and a mother who was a teacher. After the death of his father in 2010, he quit his job and travelled through parts of Asia and Europe. His grandmother told news outlet 9News that she believed these travels changed him, saying: ""It's only since he travelled overseas I think that boy has changed - completely to the boy we knew"". Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and started planning his attacks against the Muslim community. He was active on fringe online forums and posted a 74-page ""manifesto"" online prior to his attack. The attack prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.

Christchurch killer to stay in jail until he dies,"The victims of the Christchurch massacre A white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand will serve life in jail without parole - the first person in the country's history to receive the sentence. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 29, admitted to the murder of 51 people, attempted murder of another 40 people and one charge of terrorism. The judge called Tarrant's actions ""inhuman"", saying he ""showed no mercy"". The attack last March, which was livestreamed, shocked the world. Tarrant's sentencing also marks the first terrorism conviction in New Zealand's history. ""Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,"" said Judge Cameron Mander in a Christchurch court on Thursday. On imposing a sentence of life without parole, Justice Mander said: ""If not here, then when?"" A sentence without parole means the offender will not be given the opportunity to leave prison after serving only a portion of their total sentence. Justice Mander said such life sentences without parole were reserved only for the ""very worst murders"". New Zealand does not have the death penalty as part of its justice system. Justice Mander had harsh words for Tarrant in his sentencing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, upon hearing of Tarrant's sentencing, said it meant he would have ""no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again"". ""Today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist,"" she said. The shootings prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners. On the last day of a four-day sentencing hearing, Justice Mander spent almost an hour reminding Tarrant of each person he killed and injured. He added that despite the gunman's guilty pleas, the gunman appeared ""neither contrite nor ashamed"". Tarrant, who said through a lawyer in court that he did not oppose the prosecution's application for a life without parole sentence, did not react to the sentence. He had earlier also refused the right to speak at his sentencing. The sentencing hearing began on Monday, with a large part of the first three days dedicated to hearing victim impact statements. Tarrant appeared largely emotionless over the past three days, as almost 90 victims - some grieving, others defiant - confronted him. This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, speaks in court Sara Qasem, whose father Abdelfattah Qasem died at the Al Noor Mosque, spoke of the last moments of his death, saying: ""I wonder if he was in pain, if he was frightened, and what his final thoughts were. And I wish more than anything in the world that I could have been there to hold his hand and tell him it would all be OK."" She struggled to hold back her tears, before looking at Tarrant and saying ""these tears are not for you"". Ahmed Wali Khan, who lost his uncle in the attacks, told the BBC that the Muslim community in Christchurch welcomed the verdict. ""Everyone was quite happy that justice has been served,"" he said, adding that the community had been ""waiting for this decision for a very long time"". Taj Kamran, an Afghan refugee who was shot several times in the leg and still requires walking aids, said he would ""be able to sleep"" after the verdict, though it would not return those who were lost. ""No punishment is going to bring our loved ones back and our sadness will continue for the rest of our lives,"" he told the AFP news agency. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Irfan Yunianto, a doctoral student from Indonesia who survived the shootings, said he was relieved that the gunman had finally been sentenced. ""I was at the shooting location. Many of my friends died. I also saw with my own eyes how my friends were trying to save the victims,"" he said. ""I accept the court decision with good grace,"" he added. ""Following this trial has been really hard, but I still watched it online. After the verdict was reached I felt so relieved because the court finally delivered its final verdict."" Tarrant received the maximum possible sentence in New Zealand, which does not have the death penalty. ""We are not in a country where we can expect the death penalty. But they have served justice, giving the maximum prison time without parole,"" said Hina Amir, 34, who was outside Al Noor mosque when Tarrant began his attack. The gunman opened fire on two mosques in the city on 15 March last year. He first targeted worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque. Less than 30 seconds later, he returned to his car to pick up another weapon and then re-entered the mosque and resumed firing on those inside. The entire incident was broadcast on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot two people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. Two police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, he told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his attack and he wished he had done so. During this week's sentencing, the court heard that the gunman planned to target another mosque but was detained by officers on the way. The 29-year-old white supremacist has been described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing terrorist"". He was born in the Australian state of New South Wales to a father who was a garbage collector and a mother who was a teacher. After the death of his father in 2010, he quit his job and travelled through parts of Asia and Europe. His grandmother told news outlet 9News that she believed these travels changed him, saying: ""It's only since he travelled overseas I think that boy has changed - completely to the boy we knew"". Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and started planning his attacks against the Muslim community. He was active on fringe online forums and posted a 74-page ""manifesto"" online prior to his attack. The attack prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.

Manhunt after 'three boys abducted',"Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen Safi are said to have been taken from their foster home An urgent manhunt is under way for a father who abducted his three sons from their foster home, police have said. Imran Safi, 26, is said to have threatened a foster carer with a knife in Coulsdon, south London, last Thursday. He is accused of taking Bilal, Mohammed Ebrar and Mohammed Yaseen - aged six, five and three. An image of Mr Safi has been circulated to all ports and borders amid concerns he may attempt to take the boys abroad. All three brothers were playing in the garden while their foster carer was inside the house on Coulsdon Road when they were taken, detectives said. The foster carer, who told officers that Safi threatened her with a knife, did not suffer any serious physical injuries but was ""understandably distressed"". It is understood that the boys were due to be formally adopted, a fact detectives believe could have been a motivation for the abduction. Mr Safi was not thought to have access to the boys' passports. Imran Safi is said to be in possession of a knife, the Met said Metropolitan Police Commander Jon Savell said the boys had ""been in social care services for some while"" and their natural family had become aware they were going to be adopted. He added that Mr Safi was not allowed to go to the foster carer's address and had ""taken the law into his own hands"" by doing so. Mr Savell said it was ""an absolute priority"" to find the three children and more than 100 officers were working to locate them. ""They have been taken from a place of safety and we are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, particularly as we remain in the midst of a global health crisis,"" he said. ""While we do not believe at this time there is any immediate risk to their physical safety, their location, access to accommodation, healthcare, and other provisions is entirely unknown."" ""We are concerned about the longer-term impact of this on all three children. ""An intense investigation into how this abduction was planned and carried out is being led by detectives in south London, alongside a manhunt being led by specialist detectives within the Met."" Eight people aged between 17 and 37 have been arrested in connection with the abduction. They were all arrested in Croydon and have been bailed to a later date, the Met said. A red Nissan Qashqai, with the registration PK13 WFO, is thought to have been involved in the abduction. Police are appealing for any dashcam footage which shows the car believed to be linked to Imran Safi By Home Affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Police are struggling with this case. The usual tactics of CCTV, automatic number plate cameras, and tracking mobile phone usage have not worked. The getaway car was found in the area. It is possible the father may have switched vehicles. The first thing they did was to inform airports and sea ports. Now they are worried an attempt will be made to smuggle the children abroad - a traumatic experience for such young boys. It may already have happened. Ch Supt Dave Stringer urged witnesses who knew about the children's whereabouts to come forward Mr Safi is an Afghan national and has links to Pakistan but police do not yet know if he has travelled overseas. Detectives are working closely with national and international agencies to ensure any movement into foreign countries is identified. Ch Supt Dave Stringer said that the incident would ""understandably send a shock"" to the local Croydon community. ""We know there are people with detailed knowledge of the whereabouts of these children, and we fully appreciate there may be very good reasons for those individuals not wanting to come forward,"" he said. ""But right now I would strongly urge them to do the right thing and assist us in locating them."" Croydon Council declined to comment due to the ""active police investigation"".

"Almost 17,500 children tested for coronavirus","Nearly 17,500 children were tested for coronavirus across Scotland over the past week - but only 49 were positive, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Demand for testing has increased ""significantly"" since pupils returned to schools earlier this month But the first minister said the 49 children aged between two and 17 who tested positive last week was only two more than the previous week. This was despite a 300% increase in the number of children who were tested. Ms Sturgeon said this underlined that parents and teachers should not be ""unduly concerned"" about the return to school. The total number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland has now passed 20,000, with a further 68 positive results over the past 24 hours. Covid testing hit by 'exceptional demand' A huge rise in demand for coronavirus tests has seen some people in Scotland told they must travel hundreds of miles - including to England and Northern Ireland - to attend a testing centre. Ms Sturgeon said the number of children and young people being brought forward for tests had ""increased significantly"" in the two weeks since schools reopened. ""Last week alone, just short of 17,500 young people between two and 17 were tested,"" she said. ""That is a very significant number, but the key point I want to make from that is that of those, only 49 tested positive. That is a positivity rate of 0.3%."" The first minister said she could ""well understand why many parents and teachers have a concern about the return to school"". But she said the figures revealed ""the bigger picture"", adding: ""Despite an increase of more than 300% in testing of young people from one week to the next, the number of positive cases recorded increased by just two. ""That is encouraging, and I hope it's reassuring to parents and teachers across the country. I hope it will encourage people to absolutely continue to be vigilant, but not to be unduly concerned about young people in schools."" Ms Sturgeon urged parents to ""remember the symptoms that trigger the need for a test"", saying that a runny nose alone was not a reason to be tested. The testing system has been hit by ""exceptional demand"" in recent days, with people in Glasgow and the central belt being directed to test centres in Inverness and Cumbria. Ms Sturgeon said there ""may have been some technical issues"" which led to people being ""directed erroneously to testing centres in England"", and that work was ongoing to resolve the problem. There have been concerns about clusters of the virus linked to schools, such as Kingspark School in Dundeewhich has had to be closed. A total of 34 cases have now been linked to the school, including 21 staff and three pupils, but Ms Sturgeon said there was ""no evidence of wider community transmission"" of the virus. The Scottish government has changed its guidance to recommend that pupils in secondary schools wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas from Monday of next week. However ministers believe the spread of the virus is a bigger issue outside of schools, with the police to be given new powers from Friday to break up house parties. Ms Sturgeon said ""these kind of gatherings pose a significant transmission risk"". By Doug Kennedy Just as things were heading towards some kind of ""new normal"", we've found ourselves stuck in lockdown again. My two boys haven't looked back since returning to the routine of uniform, drop-off, classes, after school, homework - not home schooling - and so on. But they've also returned to the routine of new term sickness and bugs. First my youngest had a runny nose and a cold, which I picked up, and this then spread to my oldest. But my oldest's symptoms lingered to become a mild fever and a new, continuous cough. On that the advice is clear - new, continuous cough equals self-isolate and test. Figures today confirm that this has been another part of the new normal for parents across Scotland, with more than 17,000 children tested in the past week. We, too, experienced the way this is squeezing the system, going through an hour of being offered the Isle of Bute as our closest available test - a two-hour trip with a ferry crossing. Persistence got us to Prestwick Airport drive-through testing, so yesterday we headed down, went through the rigmarole of self-testing each other in the car and we are back at home, isolating, waiting for results. These should come on Friday and hopefully confirm nothing more than the familiar cycle of school age coughs and colds. In the meantime we're back under each other's feet and making the most of this new, new normal. Pupils in Scotland have returned to school A total of 20,056 people in Scotland have now tested positive for Covid-19, with 257 currently being treated in hospital. But there have been no further deaths linked to confirmed cases of the virus since Ms Sturgeon announced that two people had died on Wednesday. Ms Sturgeon warned that the virus ""is still out there and is not going away"", adding: ""People are still dying of this virus, so we must continue to treat the threat of Covid seriously."" The first minister also said the Scottish government was monitoring a pilot scheme in England that willpay people on low incomes Â£13 a dayif they have to self-isolate and cannot work from home. The payment, announced by UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, applies to benefit claimants who live in areas where there are high numbers of coronavirus cases. The England-wide scheme will begin with a trial in areas of north west England where there have been tighter lockdown measures after a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We have been encouraging the UK government to put in place support, and we are ascertaining the details. ""It seems to me to make sense for that to be administered through existing welfare or benefits systems, and obviously we are seeking to understand what the financial consequential position is for the Scottish government."" She said the Scottish government would then take a decision of its own once it had the information it needed. DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

Apple Fortnite players left behind in new update,"Fortnite's latest update has a high-profile Marvel superheroes event - but not on Apple machines People who play Fortnite on Apple Macs, iPhones and iPads are to be excluded from the game's latest update. It follows the weeks-long escalating row between the two companies, which resulted in Fortnite being pulled from Apple's App Store. Mac computers, which do not use the App Store, are also now affected. Fortnite's updates often make sweeping changes to the game and Thursday's introduces a partnership with Marvel comics superheroes, among other things. Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney blamed Apple's plan to pull access to developer tools on 28 August, the day after the new season begins. ""Apple has said they will revoke all of Epic's Apple SDK [software development kit] access for game development on Friday,""he said,external. ""If they do that, we won't be able to update Fortnite on Mac."" Current versions of the Mac operating system try to stop users opening any apps not checked by Apple,using a process called ""notarising"".,external Apple Mac computers - such as the iMac - also have strict rules about apps Apple had attempted to revoke Epic's access to its developer toolsfor the entire company but was prevented by a court ruling because Epic also makes Unreal Engine, a game development tool used by lots of creators. And removing its compatibility could have hurt companies not involved in the dispute. ""Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other,""the judge ruled. ""But their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders She did, however, allow Apple to pull those kind of permissions for Epic's own games, such as Fortnite, saying the company had ""strategically chosen to breach its agreements with Apple"". The row began when Epic issued an update for Fortnite that allowed players to buy the in-game currency, V Bucks, directly from Epic instead of using the Apple payment system. Apple takes a 30% cut from those payments - amounting to millions of dollars from Fortnite. And it is the only payment system allowed on apps available through the official app store. But Apple rejects the accusations it runs any kind of monopoly. It says Epic deliberately violated the guidelines ""that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users"". Epic is also locked in a similar stand-off with Google, on Android phones. But Android allows apps to be installed outside of the Google Play app store. And Fortnite's update is available this way.

Flu vaccination rates prompt complacency warning,"Flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable have been falling in the UK Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, experts warn, as data reveals the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme. Last month, the governmentannounced plans to doublethe number of people who receive the influenza jab. But BBC analysis has found the take-up rate among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declined. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not want a flu outbreak ""at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". The government wants to increase the number of people vaccinated from 15 million to 30 million amid fears coronavirus cases will rise again in the autumn. Local authorities in England saw an average 45% of people with serious health conditions under 65 take up the offer of a free vaccine last winter, data shows. That represents a drop from 50% in 2015. The UK government has an ambition to vaccinate 55% of people in vulnerable groups, which includes people with multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes or chronic asthma. The World Health Organization,external(WHO) has previously said countries should vaccinate 75% of people in ""vulnerable"" categories. Public Health England,externalsays the jab -  which in recent years has been freely available to over 65s, those with long running health conditions and pregnant women, among others - is the most effective way to reduce pressures on intensive care units. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government was expanding its flu vaccination programme this year because ""we don't want a flu outbreak at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". ""We have bought more flu vaccine than ever before,"" he said. ""In fact we have changed the law so that more people can administer the jab. We want pharmacists, nurses and GPs to be able to administer the jab."" Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson suffers from the long-term effects of Covid-19 The prospect of a surge in flu cases over winter is also of concern to many people still suffering from what has been dubbed ""long Covid"". That is where coronavirus patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue and breathlessness long after two weeks. Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson, a digital culture and communications student at the University of Liverpool, is one of many long-term Covid sufferers to join a growing online community. The 27-year-old, from Washington in the United States, used to be a keen runner - but now has to take a steroid inhaler and struggles to walk up stairs at her university halls. She said: ""I think getting the flu vaccine is vital now more than ever with the possible co-mingling of Covid and flu. ""I would think about it in the same way as wearing a mask when you go out. It's about mutual respect for people. ""It's more than just your own health - we have to think about everyone in our society."" Dr Tonia Thomas, project manager at the Vaccine Knowledge Trust, which is part of the University of Oxford, said: ""People think the flu is not that bad, that is even for people who are in the risk groups. ""They are leading healthy lives in terms of day-to-day living. I have spoken to patients who say they forgot they are in a risk group. ""It is only when they contract an infection that they realise their body responds differently to other people's."" The uptake rate among over-65s has remained consistent in recent years, however. Last winter, 73% took up the offer. By BBC Health Correspondent Smitha Mundasad Health officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine gets one this year - with around 30 million people being offered them in the UK's largest ever flu immunisation programme. But how will it work? And will things be worse this year? Continue reading here. Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during this year - as a big flu season combined with a fresh surge of coronavirus cases could overwhelm hospitals. Between September 2019 and February this year, almost 8,000 people died from flu in England alone. But the number has varied. In 2017 and 2018, more than 22,000 people died from the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters During the 2019-20 flu season, 3.16 million people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition were vaccinated, 130,000 more than there were five years before. But taking into account factors such as population growth, the proportion of vulnerable people receiving the jab has fallen. Figures from the last winter flu season show local authorities in England averaged just 45%. In Scotland it was 43%, Northern Ireland 52% and Wales 44%. London and the east of England are suffering from particularly low uptake rates among vulnerable patients and in schools. Only 29% of people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition took up the jab in Hammersmith and Fulham last winter. While the government is aiming for a ""universal"" uptake of the flu vaccine among health workers, it has also remained historically low in some parts of the NHS and, in particular, mental health care providers. At West London NHS Trust, which looks after mental health patients in Hammersmith and Ealing, some 1,471 of its 2,880 front-line staff took the jab last winter. ""Our current position remains unacceptably low,"" said Stephanie Bridger, director of nursing and patient experience. ""This year - in the context of Covid-19 - we are redoubling our efforts to promote the critical importance of having the flu vaccination as early as possible."" Professor Heidi Larson says ""apathy"" is the main barrier Prof Heidi Larson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world-leading expert on attitudes towards immunisation and a director of the International Vaccine Confidence Project. While many fear the jab or nasal spray can cause illness, she believes most underestimate the severity of flu. ""I find there is almost a complacency around the vaccine in the UK,"" she said. ""It doesn't have the same aggressive 'anti' sentiment we see against some of the childhood vaccines."" Early surveys carried out by the Vaccine Confidence Project show that, in Europe, there is growing support for the flu vaccine as people are concerned about a second Covid-19 wave. However, Prof Larson said many did not take the vaccine for legitimate reasons, particularly as the nasal spray given to children contains porcine gelatine. It is not suitable for vegetarians and, last year, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was not permitted in Islam except under exceptional health circumstances. ""There are also people that say it doesn't work enough, it's not effective enough,"" Prof Larson added. ""Some years it really isn't that effective against all strains. ""But I would certainly urge people to take it anyway as you wouldn't want the strains that it does protect against. ""It's also so important to limit the stress on the system. ""Two or three years ago the Red Cross had to come in to handle a bad flu season on its own."" Prof Wendy Barclay says health bosses have failed to make an effective case Previous government flu campaigns have also failed to address the ""myth"" that the vaccine can cause illness, according to leading virologist Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious diseases at Imperial College London. She believes this puts many parents off allowing their children to take the nasal spray. In the capital, only 50% of eligible schoolchildren had the free vaccine last winter. Prof Barclay said: ""My issue with Public Health England is if they don't make the message strong enough - so parents think: 'It's only the flu, my kids will be fine'."" Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the UK had some of the best flu vaccine uptake rates across Europe. She said: ""Flu vaccine uptake rates in Europe and the flu vaccination programme will be supported with a major new public facing marketing campaign to encourage take up amongst eligible groups for the free flu vaccine. ""With Covid-19 still likely to be circulating during flu season, it is more important than ever to have the flu vaccination and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer of vaccination to help relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives.""

Diesel train derailment sparks huge fire,"This video can not be played Investigations begin into railway diesel spill at Llangennech A freight train carrying diesel has derailed and burst into flames, with fuel spilling into a nearby river. About 300 people were evacuated from their homes in Llangennech, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, during the ""major incident"" on Wednesday night. Natural Resources Wales said it was not safe to try and contain a diesel spill which had gone into the River Loughor. A driver and engineer, onboard the train, were not injured and are being supported, owners DB Cargo UK said. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver had noticed something was wrong with the train, which was travelling from Milford Haven. It then derailed and the fire started. The blaze, which was still burning Thursday evening, was reported at about 23:20 BST on Wednesday and police said it had been declared a ""major incident"" due to the ""initial risk of harm"" to people nearby. People living within 800m of the fire described seeing ""plumes of smoke"" and seeing flames from the tracks, when they were evacuated from their homes. They have since been allowed back. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it was carrying out a preliminary examination and gathering evidence. Louise Perkins says she saw a ""massive fire and black smoke"" British Transport Police and Natural Resources Wales said their priorities, once they are able to access the site, were the fire itself and making the scene safe, as well as the environmental issues resulting from the spill. Bill Kelly, from Network Rail, said damage to the infrastructure was significant and would be further assessed by teams ""when it is safe for us to do so"". ""In terms of services this will obviously impact the central Wales line... I don't have timescales just yet on when we're likely to get them running again,"" he added. ""We will be able to continue running freight services using diversionary routes."" Ioan Williams, from Natural Resources Wales, said ""a significant volume of diesel has been spilled... we can confirm there is diesel in the River Loughor itself."" Puma Energy confirmed the third party-operated train was carrying its fuel from Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, to Theale, near Reading, when three tanks caught fire. ""Our immediate priority is to work with the emergency services, Network Rail, environmental agencies and the train operator to ensure public safety is maintained and any possible environmental impacts are mitigated,"" a spokesman said. Puma Energy has not yet confirmed how much fuel the train was carrying, or how much caught fire. The site of the derailment is close to the Loughor Estuary, which is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation. The tankers are being monitored and cooled, the fire service say But Aneurin Cox, duty incident manager for Natural Resources Wales, said it was ""not currently safe"" for workers to get close enough to try and contain the spill while the fire was burning. ""Once it's safe to do so, we will work with our partners to fully assess the environmental impact and advise Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin,"" he said. ""We will also be keeping local angling and cockling groups informed of the latest situation."" The cockle beds in the Burry Inlet - worked by 35 licensed pickers - have been closed following the diesel spill. Robert Griffiths, secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association, said he had been contacted by fisheries officers following a meeting of a number of agencies which monitor the beds. Mr Griffiths said the extent of any diesel pollution was still being assessed and it was hoped the closure would last only a few days. Louise Perkins, who lives close to the railway line, said she grabbed some stuff and rushed from her home with her children, aged seven, 12 and 19, in the middle of the night. The 38-year-old was up late watching TV when she heard an enormous bang: ""There was this massive fire and black smoke. ""As we left it was just fire - you could see like balls of it puffing up, and the smell... the smell of diesel. ""It was just everywhere, and there were just black, black clouds of smoke in the air."" Emergency services had dealt with a ""fast-moving"" and ""large scale"" situation, police say Ms Perkins said she was ""quite worried"" when police explained ""it could explode"". ""At that point my children were up and and they got really distressed,"" she said. Her 19-year-old son went to his friend's house while her two younger children went to their grandmother's. ""They were worried - 'oh, what if our house catches fire, what about all the stuff?'"" she explained. ""I told them not to panic. But my youngest was really upset, she was just heartbroken, she was crying."" The fire started after a number of tanks of the train derailed One Twitter user said,externalthey could smell burning fuel from ""well over a mile away"". Councillor Gwyneth Thomas, a former A&E nurse, was at the scene to offer help if needed and said how ""hugely impressed"" she was by ""how calm"" the emergency service personnel were. ""Some carried young children and others took their dogs with them,"" she recalled. ""It's very fortunate that the accident didn't happen closer to Llangennech [railway] station where there are more homes, and evacuation of residents would have been more difficult."" Sandra Thomas says she was watching TV in bed when police came knocking at her door Sandra Thomas has lived on Pontarddulais Road since 1972 and said nothing like this had ever happened before and the fire went up ""like a bomb"". ""I was terrified - I'm shaking all over,"" she said, adding police knocked on her door while she was watching TV in bed. She was sent to the community centre, but was allowed to return home on Thursday morning. But Ms Thomas became concerned when she looked out of her window at 08:00 to see a large black plume of smoke. ""I don't feel 100% safe in case it sparks off again and the rest of the tankers go up,"" she added. Llangennech is near the Carmarthenshire-Swansea county border, in south-west Wales Speaking at a press conference just before midday, Supt Andy Morgan, of BTP, said: ""While this is an ongoing incident that may go on for some time, we are hugely thankful that no-one has been injured or anything more serious than that has happened here."" When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed. Multiple emergency services and agencies attended The fire has also resulted in delays on passenger trains between Llanelli and Llandrindod Wells in Powys,Transport for Wales said,external. All lines between the two stations have been closed and TfW said it expected disruption on all routes throughout Thursday. Buses will be put on for services affected by the fire. From the Loughor estuary along to the Burry inlet, is an important habitat for wading birds and wildfowl The River Loughor's estuary, along with the Burry Inlet to the west, is designated as a site of special scientific interest Its habitat of tidal mudflats, saltmarsh - the largest continuous area in Wales - and rockpools offer important wildlife habitat Species of wading birds and wildfowl include oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, little egret, widgeon, dunlin, plover and teal The estuary is known for its fishing grounds, for the likes of flounder, bass and mullet Further west, the Burry Inlet's cockle beds are well known, with the industry the third largest in Britain In that same area is the WWT Llanelli wetland centre, a popular place for spotting wading birds and wildfowl and the 450 acres of grounds.

Schools 'not aware' they can order free tampons,"Charities say many schools and colleges are not aware they can order free period products through a government scheme, amid concerns Covid-19 has left more pupils struggling to access and afford tampons and pads. Just under 40% of state schools and colleges have placed orders since it was launched in England in January. The government says the opt-in scheme has operated throughout the pandemic. But campaigners say it should be promoted moreas schools return. Gemma Abbott, from the Free Periods group, said ""many schools and students [are] still not aware"" of the scheme, which aims to help prevent children in colleges, primary and secondary schools missing lessons if they don't have access to products at home. ""The government also needs to take some responsibility for the fact that more than 60% of eligible schools and colleges have yet to sign up to the scheme,"" she said - adding that Free Periods has ""hardly heard anything"" from the Department for Education (DfE) since the initiative's launch. Does my child have to return to school? 'Am I sweating or have I leaked?' Periods, pills & sport Period poverty rises in lockdown, charities say ""If DfE really is committed to ensuring that 'no young person's education is disrupted by their period', as they said back in January, then they need to make much more effort to ensure that schools and colleges know about the scheme, that they place orders for products and that they distribute those products efficiently and sensitively to students who need them."" She added that the government had suggested that the ""opt-in"" nature of the scheme would be reconsidered if there was insufficient uptake. ""If these stats have not improved quite drastically by October half-term, this surely needs to be considered,"" she said. Institutions that opt in can order from a range of items online, via email or over the phone usingan allocated budget for 2020. The DfE said it expects uptake ""to return to pre-lockdown levels"" when children go back to lessons - and that some schools did continue to operate the scheme during lockdown. Benfield School in Newcastle is one of those. It stayed open for keyworker children, but staff delivered products to the homes of pupils who were eligible for free school meals. Benfield School in Newcastle asked its students for their insights on tackling period poverty However, assistant head teacher Sarah Wardle said with schools facing so much turmoil, tackling period poverty may not be a priority or a possibility for others. She thinks making it mandatory for schools to use the scheme - and to educate about periods more broadly - would increase uptake. ""It might be that it needs to come to that so that staff sit up and say 'we need to do something about this',"" she said, adding she expects demand to rise in September. ""Some of our students' parents might have just been earning enough in terms of them not being able to access free school meals. I think one of the issues when we come back is that those people who were just on the cusp might have lost their jobs, might not be working, and there will be a need."" The scheme is demand-led, so uptake is monitored and used to determine spending. Staff at Benfield School in Newcastle have raised the issue of period poverty at parents' evenings Phs Group, which supplies the products for the government's scheme and runs the online portal for orders, said it expects uptake to ""rise considerably"" in September. Warren Edmondson, managing director of phs Direct, called the scheme is a ""major achievement"" in tackling period poverty, but added: ""The onus is now on schools and colleges to claim their free products and orders must be received by the end of the autumn term."" Amika George, who started the campaign to get free period products into schools as a teenager, said the government needs to do more to promote it, particularly as the pandemic has been a ""disaster"" for those who were already struggling to afford products. Amika George ""Household incomes have been squeezed and with so many jobs feeling fragile, children are not even asking their parents for money for pads,"" she said, adding that young people may have lost part-time jobs to buy their own. She wants the government to contact schools and offer help if they are not ordering through the scheme. According to research by charity Plan International, three in 10 girls in the UK have experienced issues either affording or accessing period products during the pandemic, while one in five said their periods have been harder to manage due to the lack of available toilet roll. The charity's Katie Morrison said that while coronavirus is one factor affecting uptake, some schools may not see period poverty as a relevant issue or priority for their pupils. ""Others may want to engage, but don't know how to go about it,"" she said. The charity has released guidance for schools going back in September, which advises on how to deliver free product schemes and to facilitate discussions about what pupils need. The England schememirrors one already rolled out in Scotlandwhich launched last year, following a pilot scheme that gave free tampons and towels to low-income households in Aberdeen. Wales introduced funding for free period products in schools from April 2019 and committed more than Â£3.3m in January this year to tackle period poverty and support period dignity in 2020/21. A spokeswoman for the Welsh government added that before schools and colleges were closed in March, officials directed all local authorities and further education colleges to provide students with three months' supply of products where needed. Onelocal authority in Northern Ireland offers free productsin public places. WILL COVID-19 CHANGE THE WORLD OF WORK FOR GOOD?:Is working from home a long-term solution?

Police officer named in Jacob Blake shooting,"Jacob Blake (left) was shot seven times in the back by police Wisconsin's attorney general has named the officer who shot a black man on Sunday, sparking days of demonstrations. Josh Kaul told reporters on Wednesday that Rusten Sheskey shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back as he opened the door of his car. Officers found a knife in Mr Blake's car, he added, but no other weapons. The shooting has sparked a wave of protests in recent days, some of which have turned violent.

This video can not be played Wisconsin attorney general names officer who shot Jacob Blake US President Donald Trump has since sent federal law enforcement to Kenosha, tweeting they were to combat ""looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets"". The Department of Justice has openeda federal investigation into the shooting,external. It has sent more than 200 FBI agents and US Marshals to the city,according to a spokeswoman,external. Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said he had authorised 500 National Guard troops to support law enforcement efforts amid concerns about further violence. Protests have also spread to a number of other US cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. On Wednesday, Mr Kaul updated reporters on the ongoing investigation into the shooting. Officers were called to an address on Sunday evening after a woman reported ""her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises"".

While there they tried to arrest Mr Blake, initially using a taser against him. After Mr Blake opened his car door, Officer Rusten Sheskey - who has been in the Kenosha Police Department for seven years - fired seven shots into Mr Blake's back. ""No other officer fired their weapon,"" Mr Kaul said. Mr Blake has since told investigators that he had a knife in his possession, and Mr Kaul said officers ""recovered a knife from the driver's side floorboard"" of his car. They found no other weapon in the vehicle. Three facts that help explain anger in the US 'Black people have been through a lot this year' Wisconsin's attorney general also addressed the recent violence in the city, calling it ""despicable"". He said that there are some people ""involved in destructive activity who are not from the city of Kenosha or not from the state of Wisconsin"". ""All they are doing is creating chaos,"" he said, adding that the people of Kenosha ""deserve to have the opportunity to grieve, protest peacefully [and] call for the change they want to see."" There have been days of demonstrations and unrest after Mr Blake's shooting. On Tuesday, a small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police in Kenosha, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Can viral videos stop police brutality? What's next after flood of racial equity donations? A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city.

Migrants deported as hunger strike continuesThe Home Office says 12 people were flown back to France or Germany amid protests from campaigners.,"The Home Office has arranged a series of flights to return migrants who crossed the English Channel A plane due to remove asylum-seekers from the UK has been cancelled after legal challenges. The Home Office said the charter flight was ""paused"" to allow time for the applications to be considered. On Wednesday, 12 migrants were returned to France and Germany by plane. Asylum-seekers at a detention centre near Gatwick Airport are on hunger strike in protest at the proposed flights and some are reported to have tried to take their own lives. In a Twitter post, the Home Office had earlier claimed that EU regulations that determine where an asylum claim is heard were being used by ""activist lawyers"" to delay and disrupt returns flights. Simon Davis, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said it was ""highly misleading and dangerous"" for the Home Office to claim ""fundamentally that lawyers are not to be trusted"". ""Attacks on the integrity of the legal profession undermine the rule of law,"" he said. Charity Detention Action said 22 asylum-seekers at Brook House, near Gatwick Airport, were on hunger strike, while eight had tried to take their own lives. The Home Office said it was ""right that we seek to remove migrants who have travelled through a safe country and have no right to remain in the UK"". Attempts to return migrants to EU countries were often ""frustrated"" by last-minute legal challenges, which it said were ""very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled,"" it added. Twenty-seven people - from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - have been flown back to European countries this month. The majority had arrived in the UK on small boats. On Thursday morning, 26 migrants from Sudan crossed the Channel in three dinghies. More than 5,000 people have reached the UK in this way this year.

TikTok boss quits as Trump's ban looms,"TikTok chief executive Kevin Mayer has quit after just two months in the job ahead of an impending ban by US President Donald Trump. The Chinese-owned firm has been accused of being a threat to US national security by the Trump administration. Mr Mayer joined TikTok in June after leaving his role as Disney's head of streaming services. TikTok was given 90 days to be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the US. ""In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what theÂ corporate structural changesÂ will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,"" Mr Mayer said in a letter to employees. TikTok calls Trump ban âpoliticalâ in lawsuit TikTok hits back after Trump threatens US ban Microsoft and TikTok talks continue after Trump call ""Against this backdrop,Â and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know thatÂ I have decided to leave the company,"" Mr Mayer added. Both TikTok and Chinese messaging app WeChat face bans in the US as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing over a wide range of issues including national security concerns about Chinese tech firms. ""We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin's role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision. We thank him for his time at the company and wish him well,"" a spokesman for TikTok said. Kevin Mayer was brought into TikTok to help give the Chinese-owned app an American image. The thinking was that the former Disney man would be able to negotiate with a tough-on-China Trump administration better than perhaps a Chinese chief executive and that would help smooth TikTok's path into one of its biggest markets - the US. Instead, the intense pressure from the Trump administration on TikTok only grew. President Trump claims TikTok is a national security threat because of who it is owned by, Chinese internet firm ByteDance. Earlier this month, he signed an executive order that would effectively ban TikTok's operations in the US if it wasn't sold to another company by mid September. All of this is not what Mr Mayer signed up for when he left Walt Disney to take on the role at TikTok. And after just two months in the job, he is now departing. President Trump's executive order prohibits transactions with TikTok's owner ByteDance from mid-September. The firm has gone to court to challenge the ban. Officials in Washington are concerned that TikTok could pass American users' data to the Chinese government, something ByteDance has denied doing. TikTok said the Trump administration's move was motivated by politics, not national security. US tech giant Microsoft has confirmed that it is continuing talks to purchase the US operations of TikTok.

New Liberal Democrat leader to be announced,"The Liberal Democrats are set to announce their new leader later as the contest for the top job comes to an end. The party's acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, and one of its MPs, Layla Moran, have been competing in the leadership race since June. The winner will be the first permanent leader since Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the 2019 election. The result will be announced online at 11:30 BST (10:30 GMT). The contest has been carried out remotely due to the coronavirus, with online campaigning and virtual hustings. Davey and Moran in race to be next Lib Dem leader Lib Dem candidates pitch for votes Is targeting the 'yellow halo' key to party's success? Sir Ed has been acting leader since Ms Swinson stepped down in December, and was a cabinet minister in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. In a BBC debate between the candidates, he said he had learnt from his experience of working with former leader Paddy Ashdown to build up the party in the 1990s. And he said would use the party's local government base ""as a springboard for results in the future"". This video can not be played Ed Davey is asked about the Lib Dem party polling falling by half since he became acting party co-leader. Ms Moran has been an MP since 2017 and now acts as the party's education spokeswoman. She said her lack of experience in Parliament would be an asset ""at a time when people don't trust politicians"". The MP also pointed to her success of overturning ""a massive majority"" in her Oxford constituency, adding: ""We did that by amassing a group of people from all sides of the political spectrum."" This video can not be played Layla Moran: âWe need to win back the trust of the electorate, show we have learned from the mistakes of the past.â The Lib Dems originally planned to delay the contest to succeed Ms Swinson until May 2021.

They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing. Read morehere.  Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing.

Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

Flu vaccination rates prompt complacency warningExperts fear the winter flu season could coincide with a rise in Covid-19 infections.UKComments,"Flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable have been falling in the UK Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, experts warn, as data reveals the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme. Last month, the governmentannounced plans to doublethe number of people who receive the influenza jab. But BBC analysis has found the take-up rate among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declined. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not want a flu outbreak ""at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". The government wants to increase the number of people vaccinated from 15 million to 30 million amid fears coronavirus cases will rise again in the autumn. Local authorities in England saw an average 45% of people with serious health conditions under 65 take up the offer of a free vaccine last winter, data shows. That represents a drop from 50% in 2015. The UK government has an ambition to vaccinate 55% of people in vulnerable groups, which includes people with multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes or chronic asthma. The World Health Organization,external(WHO) has previously said countries should vaccinate 75% of people in ""vulnerable"" categories. Public Health England,externalsays the jab -  which in recent years has been freely available to over 65s, those with long running health conditions and pregnant women, among others - is the most effective way to reduce pressures on intensive care units. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government was expanding its flu vaccination programme this year because ""we don't want a flu outbreak at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". ""We have bought more flu vaccine than ever before,"" he said. ""In fact we have changed the law so that more people can administer the jab. We want pharmacists, nurses and GPs to be able to administer the jab."" Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson suffers from the long-term effects of Covid-19 The prospect of a surge in flu cases over winter is also of concern to many people still suffering from what has been dubbed ""long Covid"". That is where coronavirus patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue and breathlessness long after two weeks. Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson, a digital culture and communications student at the University of Liverpool, is one of many long-term Covid sufferers to join a growing online community. The 27-year-old, from Washington in the United States, used to be a keen runner - but now has to take a steroid inhaler and struggles to walk up stairs at her university halls. She said: ""I think getting the flu vaccine is vital now more than ever with the possible co-mingling of Covid and flu. ""I would think about it in the same way as wearing a mask when you go out. It's about mutual respect for people. ""It's more than just your own health - we have to think about everyone in our society."" Dr Tonia Thomas, project manager at the Vaccine Knowledge Trust, which is part of the University of Oxford, said: ""People think the flu is not that bad, that is even for people who are in the risk groups. ""They are leading healthy lives in terms of day-to-day living. I have spoken to patients who say they forgot they are in a risk group. ""It is only when they contract an infection that they realise their body responds differently to other people's."" The uptake rate among over-65s has remained consistent in recent years, however. Last winter, 73% took up the offer. By BBC Health Correspondent Smitha Mundasad Health officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine gets one this year - with around 30 million people being offered them in the UK's largest ever flu immunisation programme. But how will it work? And will things be worse this year? Continue reading here. Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during this year - as a big flu season combined with a fresh surge of coronavirus cases could overwhelm hospitals. Between September 2019 and February this year, almost 8,000 people died from flu in England alone. But the number has varied. In 2017 and 2018, more than 22,000 people died from the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters During the 2019-20 flu season, 3.16 million people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition were vaccinated, 130,000 more than there were five years before. But taking into account factors such as population growth, the proportion of vulnerable people receiving the jab has fallen. Figures from the last winter flu season show local authorities in England averaged just 45%. In Scotland it was 43%, Northern Ireland 52% and Wales 44%. London and the east of England are suffering from particularly low uptake rates among vulnerable patients and in schools. Only 29% of people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition took up the jab in Hammersmith and Fulham last winter. While the government is aiming for a ""universal"" uptake of the flu vaccine among health workers, it has also remained historically low in some parts of the NHS and, in particular, mental health care providers. At West London NHS Trust, which looks after mental health patients in Hammersmith and Ealing, some 1,471 of its 2,880 front-line staff took the jab last winter. ""Our current position remains unacceptably low,"" said Stephanie Bridger, director of nursing and patient experience. ""This year - in the context of Covid-19 - we are redoubling our efforts to promote the critical importance of having the flu vaccination as early as possible."" Professor Heidi Larson says ""apathy"" is the main barrier Prof Heidi Larson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world-leading expert on attitudes towards immunisation and a director of the International Vaccine Confidence Project. While many fear the jab or nasal spray can cause illness, she believes most underestimate the severity of flu. ""I find there is almost a complacency around the vaccine in the UK,"" she said. ""It doesn't have the same aggressive 'anti' sentiment we see against some of the childhood vaccines."" Early surveys carried out by the Vaccine Confidence Project show that, in Europe, there is growing support for the flu vaccine as people are concerned about a second Covid-19 wave. However, Prof Larson said many did not take the vaccine for legitimate reasons, particularly as the nasal spray given to children contains porcine gelatine. It is not suitable for vegetarians and, last year, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was not permitted in Islam except under exceptional health circumstances. ""There are also people that say it doesn't work enough, it's not effective enough,"" Prof Larson added. ""Some years it really isn't that effective against all strains. ""But I would certainly urge people to take it anyway as you wouldn't want the strains that it does protect against. ""It's also so important to limit the stress on the system. ""Two or three years ago the Red Cross had to come in to handle a bad flu season on its own."" Prof Wendy Barclay says health bosses have failed to make an effective case Previous government flu campaigns have also failed to address the ""myth"" that the vaccine can cause illness, according to leading virologist Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious diseases at Imperial College London. She believes this puts many parents off allowing their children to take the nasal spray. In the capital, only 50% of eligible schoolchildren had the free vaccine last winter. Prof Barclay said: ""My issue with Public Health England is if they don't make the message strong enough - so parents think: 'It's only the flu, my kids will be fine'."" Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the UK had some of the best flu vaccine uptake rates across Europe. She said: ""Flu vaccine uptake rates in Europe and the flu vaccination programme will be supported with a major new public facing marketing campaign to encourage take up amongst eligible groups for the free flu vaccine. ""With Covid-19 still likely to be circulating during flu season, it is more important than ever to have the flu vaccination and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer of vaccination to help relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives.""

'Catastrophic' Hurricane Laura hits Louisiana coast,"This video can not be played Hurricane Laura left a trail of destruction in Louisiana and Texas At least six people have been killed as Hurricane Laura battered the US state of Louisiana. Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant. But the feared 20ft (6m) storm surge was avoided as the hurricane, the state's biggest, tracked further east. Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status. It has since crossed into Arkansas. At 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Thursdaythe National Hurricane Center said the storm had weakened to maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h),external, but was still bringing heavy rainfall. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state ""did not sustain and suffer the absolute, catastrophic damage that we thought was likely,"" but stressed they had still suffered ""a tremendous amount of damage"" and warned people to remain vigilant.

President Donald Trump was briefed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in Washington and said he would go to the area at the weekend. He said he had been prepared to postpone his speech at the Republican National Convention later on Thursday to travel to the region but added: ""We got a bit lucky. It was very big and very powerful but it passed quickly.""  The president will visit the states affected at the weekend. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier swept across the Caribbean, killing 24 people. At least six people are known to have died after the storm crashed into the US, Gov Edwards told reporters. Of those, four were killed by falling trees. One man drowned in a boat that sank and another died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in his home, authorities said. Residents were told to stay indoors as a ""chemical fire"" was tackled near Lake Charles There was more structural damage from winds than anticipated, but the water damage was less than feared. Nearly 900,000 homes and businesses lost power as the storm hit the US. A barge had collided with a bridge in the city of Lake Charles, quite close to where a suspected ""chlorine chemical fire"" at an industrial plant was being attended by emergency services. More than half a million homes in Louisiana were reported to be without power Mr Edwards said people should stay off the roads where possible, as outer bands of the storm were still causing high water levels and winds. Some 1,500 people, including National Guard troops, are being deployed in rescue and clean-up missions. Vice-President Mike Pence, who joined Mr Trump at Fema, said: ""While this was a major storm with devastating impact it was not as bad as it could have been."" It was one of the strongest to ever hit the US Gulf Coast, striking as a category four with winds of up to 150mph (240km/h). Governor Edwards said it was even more powerful than Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people.

Ahead of the hurricane's arrival, more than 420,000 Texas residents were ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. The evacuations were complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. One person headed to a Texas shelter, Eric Daw, told Reuters: ""They say we are all supposed to socially distance now.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds.

The people killed as they prayed,"Fifty-one people were killed and dozens more wounded in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March 2019. A lone gunman pleaded guilty to the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre and was convicted. Below are the names and, where available, pictures of those who died. Many had moved to New Zealand to study or to work, and to build a better life for themselves and their families. Some were refugees, who thought they had found safety. The 70-year-old father of four from Somalia was killed at the Al Noor mosque. His son Said arrived at the mosque as the attack was underway, saw the gunman in the street and drove off. ""This is devastating. My father survived through civil war. I never thought this kind of stuff would happen to him in New Zealand,"" he told the Washington Post. Abdul Fattah Qasem Ibrahim Qasem was the former secretary of the Muslim Association of Canterbury was a respected elder in the Muslim community and helped with interpretation for refugees and migrants from the Middle East. ""He is a massive man, a giant. He has a heart of gold. He was that fantastic person who just wanted everyone to be amazing,"" his son-in-law Mohammed Al-Kubaisy told Stuff. He was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality. His death was confirmed by the Egyptian migration ministry. ""My dad was a good kind man,"" his son Omar told the BBC. ""Him and mum had great jobs and were well off in Egypt but they immigrated to NZ in 1996 for me. For my education, so that I could have a better chance to study what I want. We have been here 23 years."" ""He had many friends and family who loved him,â he added. âHe was a pure hearted soul who never treated anyone badly."" The retired engineer was killed while praying, his wife told the New Zealand Herald. ""We should be strong, especially in this case. I lose my husband but I'm not angry. I'm sad because I don't see him again, I don't talk to him again,"" Nuha Asad said. ""I'm happy in the same time because it happened while he prayed. I take comfort because he was a good man."" The Palestinian doctor's family believe he was killed in the attack at the mosque where he prayed every Friday. Mr Hamid and his wife Hahan moved to New Zealand 23 years ago, and had two sons. Mr Hamid specialised in cardiorespiratory illnesses for the Canterbury District Health Board. Ansi Alibava was at the mosque with her husband Ponnath Abdul Nazer, who worked in a local supermarket. The pair had moved to Christchurch from Kerala, India, in February last year so Ms Alibava could study for a master's degree in agricultural engineering. ""She loved all people - cousins, friends,"" Mr Nazer told the BBC. ""She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members.""
                        He said she had been living her dream by studying and travelling in New Zealand. Neither of them had previously been outside Kerala. They have been financially supporting their families. Ashraf Ali, from Fiji, had gone to the Al Noor mosque with his brother, Ramzan. Ramzan Ali said he managed to hide from the gunman, but his brother did not escape. Ramzan Ali told the New Zealand Herald he watched the video of the attack, and recognised his 58-year-old brother because of his Fijian rugby shirt. ""I will never be able to forget him. If he wanted to do something he would just do it. He won't even think twice. And he was always successful."" Ashraf Al-Masri was one of four Egyptian victims named by the Egyptian government. The father of two leaves behind a wife and two children. They are accompanying their husband and father's body back to Egypt for burial. He was one of four Egyptians killed in the attack.

Atta Elayyan was the goalkeeper for New Zealand's futsal (a form of five-a-side football) team and chief executive of technology consultancy and app developer LWA Solutions, which he founded in 2010. ""There is huge hole in our hearts,"" said Josh Margetts, NZF's futsal development manager. ""Atta was a great man and well liked by everyone in the Futsal Whites squad and the futsal community. There are no words to sum up how we are all feeling. He will be sorely missed."" Mr Elayyan, who was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality, leaves behind a wife, Farah, and a two-year-old daughter, Aya. Daoud Nabi was born in Afghanistan, but moved his family to New Zealand in the 1980s to escape the Soviet invasion.

Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms,"As we enter hurricane season, when there is a greater chance of more powerful storms developing in the Atlantic, here is a guide to how deadly storms form, how they are measured and why they happen where they do. Hurricanes are the biggest and most violent storms on the planet. Every year, between June and November they hit the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States, sometimes leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. In the Pacific Ocean, they are known as cyclones. In the Indian Ocean and southern Pacific, they are known as typhoons. They are all tropical storms, but they are only called hurricanes in the north Atlantic and north-eastern Pacific. Most hurricanes that form in the Atlantic are the result of an atmospheric phenomenon known as a tropical wave. The wave starts as a type of atmospheric trough that creates an area of relatively low air pressure - usually in western Africa, in mid-July. If the conditions are right for it to develop, the low pressure starts to move west, with the help of the trade winds or easterlies. When it reaches the Atlantic, the tropical wave has the potential to become a hurricane - but for this to happen it needs enough energy in the form of heat and wind. In fact, it needs a deep layer of warm water, with a surface water temperature above 27C. It also needs the right winds - horizontally swirling winds to concentrate the storm and a weak vertical wind shear rising from the surface of the sea. If the wind shear changes too much as it rises, it can disrupt the flow of heat and humidity needed to create the hurricane. The final ingredient is a concentration of rain clouds and high humidity in the area. This all needs to happen in the right place - generally between 10 and 30 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere, where the rotation of the Earth helps the winds converge and rise in the area of low pressure. When a tropical wave encounters all these elements, they all start to interact over an area between 50km (31 miles) and 100km wide. ""The movement of the tropical wave is a trigger for the storm,"" says Jorge Zaval Hidalgo, general co-ordinator of Mexico's National Weather Service. The storm is the catalyst - and the dance of heat, air and water begins. The area of low pressure cools the humid, warm air rising from the ocean, which fills the clouds. The condensation of this air releases heat, which lowers the pressure even more, drawing more humidity from the ocean and the storm builds. The winds converge and rise within the area of low pressure, spinning counter clockwise, giving the hurricane its trademark shape. While the storm becomes more powerful, the eye of the hurricane - the central area about 30-60km wide on average - remains relatively calm. Around it, rises the eye wall of dense clouds and most intense winds. Beyond that are the spiral bands of cloud, where there is the most rain. The wind speeds are what determine the moment at which we can call this phenomenon a hurricane. At its birth, it is a tropical depression. As it gathers strength, it becomes a tropical storm. When speeds reach more than 118km an hour, it is a hurricane. However, hurricanes can be classified in five categories depending on the sustained wind speeds. In the Atlantic, the Saffir-Simpson wind scale is used to measure their destructive power. One hurricane's winds can produce about half as much energy as the electrical generating capacity of the entire world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, it is not the winds that cause the most destruction and loss of life, but the storm surge and flooding caused by the hurricane's rain. In the United States, for example, the storm surge caused by tropical cyclones in the Atlantic were responsible for nearly half of hurricane-related deaths between 1963 and 2012, according to the American Meteorological Society. The level of destruction caused by a hurricane is also going to depend on other circumstances, such as the speed at which it hits, the terrain and local infrastructure in the affected area. ""The damage or danger associated with a tropical cyclone does not necessarily correspond to its category. For example, the highest level storm will not necessarily mean more rain,"" Mr Hidalgo told the BBC. Here is a recap: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging,"The biggest and most damaging hurricanes are now three times more frequent than they were 100 years ago, say researchers. Using a new method of calculating the destruction, the scientists say the increase in frequency is ""unequivocal"". Previous attempts to isolate the impact of climate change on hurricanes have often came up with conflicting results. But the new study says the increase in damage caused by these big cyclones is linked by global warming. BA reviews 'fuel-tankering' over climate concerns Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits Sea ice loss linked to spread of deadly virus Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was estimated to be $125bn, roughly 1% of US GDP. This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker takes a look at the formation of Cape Verde-type hurricanes and where their energy comes from. One of the big questions that scientists have wrestled with is how to compare storm events from different eras. Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier? Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage in Florida, but also in Antigua and Barbuda Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency. However this new paper challenges that view. Instead of looking at economic damage, the authors looked at the amount of land that was totally destroyed by more than 240 storms between 1900 and 2018, based on insurance industry databases. As an example, the researchers examined Hurricane Irma that hit Florida in 2017. Around 1.1 million people were living inside the 10,000 sq km closest to the storm's landfall. Hurricane Dorian sparked an emergency in Florida in September With the wealth per capita estimated to be $194,000, the scientists concluded that the overall wealth in this 10,000 sq km region was $215bn. As the storm caused $50bn worth of damage, this was 23% of the wealth in the region. Taking 23% of the 10,000 sq km gave an area of total destruction of 2,300 sq km. By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons in terms of damage over the decades. Hurricanes are one of the most destructive weather events on the planet The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century. And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures. ""Our data reveal an emergent positive trend in damage which we attribute to a detectable change in extreme storms due to global warming,"" they write. This video can not be played What is global warming? The scientists involved believe their new method is solid and gives a more accurate picture of what is happening with the worst storms. ""The new method of looking at the frequencies is really robust,"" said Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the study. ""The increase in frequency is not only in my own dataset but is also present in other datasets, so it is extremely robust, and I think that will help it become more accepted.""

High winds also hit Puerto Rico Meanwhile in Cuba, many residents in the country's eastern regions have been evacuated and housed in shelters or safer buildings on higher ground. Marco strengthened to a hurricane on Sunday, with sustained winds of up to 75mph (120km/h), and is moving north between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Laura is predicted to head northwest towards Houston, America's fourth-largest city.

They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing.

Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world.
They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing.

Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty,"City centres could become ""ghost towns"" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage workers to go back to the office, the head of the CBI says. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said allowing staff to work from home had helped keep firms afloat during the pandemic. But as offices stood empty, thousands of local businesses that relied on the passing trade were suffering, she said. It comes as a BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. Writing in the Daily Mail,,externalDame Carolyn said the UK's offices were ""vital drivers"" of the economy, supporting thousands of local firms, from dry cleaners to sandwich bars. ""The costs of office closure are becoming clearer by the day. Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. ""This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities,"" she said. No plan for a return to the office for millions Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan She said getting people back into offices and workplaces should be ""as important"" as the return to school, and directly appealed to Boris Johnson to ""do more to build confidence"". This could include using ""effective test and trace"" systems or a campaign to encourage commuters back on to public transport. In July, the government dropped its formal advice that people should work from home if possible. At the time, Boris Johnson told people to ""start to go back to work now if you can"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Dear customers, I face ruin, please come back' However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. Dame Carolyn acknowledged home working had worked well for many and was likely to remain ""an option"". But she warned of ""serious downsides"" including a lack of opportunities to train young people and foster better work and productivity in certain types of business. The impact on local businesses has also been stark. Sandwich chain Pret a Manger - which relies on a lunchtime work crowd - said in June it was shutting 30 outlets and cutting 1,000 jobs amid a slump in demand. It has also cut its staff's hours. ""It's time for the UK to bring its workplaces back to life or we will look back with regret at the jobs lost, training missed and communities harmed,"" Dame Carolyn said. Some businesses catering to office workers have stayed afloat by adapting the way they operate. Rich Bool, who works for the mobile coffee franchise Cafe2U in Chippenham told the BBC's Wake Up To Money that when offices closed he had to find new ways of approaching his customers. ""Some of that has been actually going to residential streets, where our normal clients ... are at home, working, and asked me to call and deliver to them"". According to Mr Bool, this attracted curious neighbours, who were also working at home and needed a break from the laptop. ""We almost created the new water cooler moment on the pavement,"" he said. Sam Barber, a partner at Workshop, which offers co-working spaces in the centre of Winchester, says she has seen a significant increase in enquiries from people who no longer want to commute to London. She told Wake Up to Money she sees a role for her company in bringing people back into the city centre. ""If we know that we can get people out of their offices, their bedrooms, wherever it is they're working, and into a flexible working space a couple of days a week ...then they're going to be shopping in local shops, they're going to be going to the local coffee shops.""

But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing.

Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

Pence warns Americans 'won't be safe' if Biden wins,"This video can not be played Pence: Stakes in this election never higher US Vice-President Mike Pence has warned that violence will spread in American cities if Joe Biden wins the White House in November. ""The hard truth is you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" said President Donald Trump's deputy in a keynote speech to the Republican convention. Mr Pence depicted the vote as a choice between law-and-order and lawlessness. He spoke amid nightly protests over the police shooting of a black man in Wisconsin on Sunday. ""The American people know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with African-American neighbours to improve the quality of life in our cities and towns,"" said Mr Pence. He blasted Mr Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, for saying there is an ""implicit bias"" against minorities and ""systemic racism"" in the US. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" Mr Pence said: ""Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities."" The third night of the Republican convention adopted a theme of ""Land of Heroes"", and the vice-president spoke from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, where the city was defended against the British in the War of 1812, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. For three and a half years, Mike Pence has been Donald Trump's most loyal sidekick - extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Pence's mission was to pitch for the president's re-election by touting his accomplishments and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. Mr Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance - talking up the president's record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. In a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: ""The choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right - and wrong - with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Hours before Mr Pence began speaking, the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer postponed games after some players refused to take part in protest over the Kenosha shooting. Mr Pence's remarks came after three people were shot, two fatally, during a third night of unrest on Tuesday over the police shooting three days earlier of Jacob Blake, 29, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Police officer named in Jacob Blake shooting The vice-president did not refer to the incident, which has inflamed protests against police brutality that have erupted across the nation over the past three months. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would send federal law enforcement to Kenosha by agreement with the state's governor. The US Department of Justice said a federal civil rights investigation had been opened into the shooting of Mr Blake. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, said earlier on Wednesday they had spoken to Mr Blake's family. Mr Blake, who was shot multiple times in the back from close range, is currently paralysed from the waist down. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do Mr Biden said in a video posted by his campaign: ""Put yourself in the shoes of every black father and black mother in this country, and ask: Is this what we want America to be? Is this the country we should be?"" The Democrat added: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest. It's needless violence."" Hammering home a recurring theme of the Republican convention, Mr Pence depicted Mr Biden, known as a political moderate over a decades-long career in Washington, as ""nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left"". The vice-president argued that the Democrat would ""set America on a path of socialism and decline"". The president joined Mr Pence with a surprise appearance at the conclusion of his speech The Democrats, too, at their convention last week warned in doom-laden tones what would happen if Mr Trump won another four years in the White House. Mr Pence has endured recent speculation that he might be dumped by Mr Trump from the Republican ticket in favour of some other running mate. But his position looked impregnable as he accepted his vice-presidential nomination on Wednesday night with glowing praise of his boss. In 2016, Mr Pence - a former Indiana governor and conservative Christian - was Mr Trump's political bridge to evangelical voters, a vital bloc with the Republican electoral base. The rare times Mike Pence made headlines Trump challenges Biden to drug test before debate Wednesday night's law-and-order message at the Republican convention was reinforced by other speakers, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. She said: ""From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. ""People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can't - good, hard-working Americans - are left to fend for themselves."" This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' Burgess Owens, an African-American former NFL player now running for Congress in Utah, said: ""This November, we stand at a crossroads. ""Mobs torch our cities while popular members of Congress promote the same socialism that my father fought against in World War II.""

Rolls-Royce reports record loss as travel slumps,"Engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, has reported record losses after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand for air travel to slump. The firm announced a pre-tax loss of Â£5.4bn for the first half of this year. Chief executive Warren East told the BBC he did not expect demand to recover to late-2019 levels for five years. On Wednesday,it confirmed the closure of factories in Nottinghamshire and Lancashire, as part of plans to cut 3,000 jobs across the UK. The move is part of a previously announced cost-cutting exercise that will see the company slash its global workforce by a fifth, following the drastic fall in air travel because of the coronavirus outbreak. Rolls-Royce is in the middle of its biggest restructuring in its history, which will reduce the number of sites it has worldwide from 11 to six. Wide-body engine assembly and testing, which is currently carried out at three global sites, will be consolidated at its main site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 50,000 people around the world, about half of them in the UK. Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that so far this year, 4,500 people worldwide had left the company. He said Rolls-Royce had originally expected to deliver up to 500 jet engines this year, but would now manage only half that. Rolls-Royce said it intended to sell its Spanish unit ITP Aero and other assets to raise at least Â£2bn. Rolls-Royce makes money not from the sale of engines, but from their use. When planes stop flying - as they have done during the pandemic - its revenues slow to a trickle. It has responded with a swingeing cost-cutting programme, with 9,000 jobs going. Despite these self-help measures, Rolls-Royce still made a Â£1.7bn operating loss in the first half of the year. But the big hit came from changes it has been forced to make to its currency hedging programme, which it has in place to protect it against swings in the value of the US dollar. The slump in airline flying means it can no longer expect such a large stream of US dollar revenues, so it has closed off some of its hedge trades early. The cost is Â£2.5bn. When you add in other restructuring costs, the total loss for the six months is Â£5.4bn, The big question now is when - and how - Rolls-Royce will shore up its balance sheet by raising money. It has earmarked Â£2bn worth of assets for sale - including Spain's ITP Aero - but that is unlikely to be enough. The next step is expected to be a rights issue, where existing shareholders pay for more shares at a discount to the market price. That could bring in around Â£2bn, about half the company's current stock market value. Some analysts think Rolls-Royce will eventually need more - and that a government intervention cannot be ruled out. Rolls-Royce said: ""In light of ongoing uncertainty in the civil aviation sector, we are continuing to assess additional options to strengthen our balance sheet to enable us to emerge from the pandemic well placed to capitalise on the long-term opportunities in all our markets."" These options could include selling off more divisions, refinancing or even tapping investors for money through a rights issue, but no decisions have been taken as yet. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mr East had faced ""a torrid time"" at Rolls-Royce, with problems including design glitches on the Trent 1000 engine. But she said managing the current Covid-19 crisis would be ""his biggest challenge yet"". She added that there were now ""further issues for the business to manage"" after Rolls-Royce said earlier this month that routine inspections of another engine type, the XWB-84, had uncovered cracks in compressor blades in a ""small number"" of examples. Rolls-Royce said at the time that it did not expect the issue to create ""significant customer disruption or material annual cost"". In its statement on Thursday, Rolls-Royce added that chief financial officer Stephen Daintith had resigned, but would remain in his role for now to support an orderly transition. Mr Daintith will be joining online grocery firm Ocado as its chief financial officer in November.

That's it for our live coverage for today. If you're just catching up with the headlines, here's a taste of what's been going on around the UK. Cases of coronavirus in the UK are on the rise We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly. Thank you for following our coverage
of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world.
They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors.

The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering.

be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday morning.,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST. People on low incomes who cannot work from homewill be able to claim Â£13 a day, up to Â£182, if they have to self-isolate under coronavirus restrictions, the government says. However, payments to those who test positive, those in their household and other eligible people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers will only apply in parts of England with high virus rates. City centres could become ""ghost towns"" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage workers back to the office, the head of business lobby group the CBI says. Allowing staff to work from home helped keep firms afloat during lockdown, butthousands of local businesses that rely on passing trade are suffering, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn writes in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the badly-hit aviation market,has reported record losses. Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, if there is a surge in Covid-19 cases this winter, vaccination specialists warn. It comes as BBC analysis of data from English local authorities found thetake-up among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declinedin recent years. In Wales,health officials are reassuring the publicit's safe to attend GP surgeries for jabs. A mother whose 16-year-old daughter has twice had an ankle operation postponed says the pandemicshould not be used as an excusefor pushing back operations. Aisling McCrory says her daughter, Dearbhaile, is in pain every day. She remains on crutches and wears a medical boot, despite several operations on the joint she fractured six years ago. Health trusts say services have been ""significantly disrupted"" by the pandemic. A mini-boom since the property market reopened in different parts of the UK has led to properties selling much faster since the height of lockdown, research suggests. In the 90 days to mid-August, a three-bedroom home hastypically sold in 24 days, 12 days quicker than the same period a year ago, property portal Zoopla said.

Cases of coronavirus in the UK are on the rise We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly. Thank you for following our coverage
of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world.
They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing. Read morehere.  Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective.

"'Catastrophic' Hurricane Laura hits Louisiana coastThe category four storm is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" surge as it moves inland in the US.US & Canada","This video can not be played Hurricane Laura left a trail of destruction in Louisiana and Texas At least six people have been killed as Hurricane Laura battered the US state of Louisiana. Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant. But the feared 20ft (6m) storm surge was avoided as the hurricane, the state's biggest, tracked further east. Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status. It has since crossed into Arkansas. At 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Thursdaythe National Hurricane Center said the storm had weakened to maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h),external, but was still bringing heavy rainfall. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state ""did not sustain and suffer the absolute, catastrophic damage that we thought was likely,"" but stressed they had still suffered ""a tremendous amount of damage"" and warned people to remain vigilant.

President Donald Trump was briefed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in Washington and said he would go to the area at the weekend. He said he had been prepared to postpone his speech at the Republican National Convention later on Thursday to travel to the region but added: ""We got a bit lucky. It was very big and very powerful but it passed quickly.""  The president will visit the states affected at the weekend. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier swept across the Caribbean, killing 24 people. At least six people are known to have died after the storm crashed into the US, Gov Edwards told reporters. Of those, four were killed by falling trees. One man drowned in a boat that sank and another died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in his home, authorities said. Residents were told to stay indoors as a ""chemical fire"" was tackled near Lake Charles There was more structural damage from winds than anticipated, but the water damage was less than feared. Nearly 900,000 homes and businesses lost power as the storm hit the US. A barge had collided with a bridge in the city of Lake Charles, quite close to where a suspected ""chlorine chemical fire"" at an industrial plant was being attended by emergency services. More than half a million homes in Louisiana were reported to be without power Mr Edwards said people should stay off the roads where possible, as outer bands of the storm were still causing high water levels and winds. Some 1,500 people, including National Guard troops, are being deployed in rescue and clean-up missions. Vice-President Mike Pence, who joined Mr Trump at Fema, said: ""While this was a major storm with devastating impact it was not as bad as it could have been."" It was one of the strongest to ever hit the US Gulf Coast, striking as a category four with winds of up to 150mph (240km/h). Governor Edwards said it was even more powerful than Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people. Debbie Darscheid and her family surveying the damage at their house after Hurricane Laura passed through Lake Charles It made landfall shortly after midnight local time (05:00 GMT) near the district of Cameron, in Louisiana. It tracked north, just east of the Texas-Louisiana border. As yet, there have been no casualties confirmed in Texas.Governor Greg Abbott toured the area hit by the storm,externalwith the US Coast Guard on Thursday, and said the state was ""ready to help communities rebuild"". Lake Charles, a city of 78,000, and its surrounding areas were badly hit. Trees and electricity pylons have been ripped from the ground and vehicles overturned.

Ahead of the hurricane's arrival, more than 420,000 Texas residents were ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. The evacuations were complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. One person headed to a Texas shelter, Eric Daw, told Reuters: ""They say we are all supposed to socially distance now. But how am I supposed to socially distance in a shelter?"" A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

US hurricane âwill cause unsurvivable storm surgeâHurricane Laura is heading for Texas and Louisiana with wind speeds of up to 150 mph (240km/h).US & Canada,"More than half a million people have been told to get out of the path of Hurricane Laura Hurricane Laura is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" storm surge, extreme winds and floods as it hits the US, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. The category four storm is approaching Texas and Louisiana with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 miles per hour (240km/h). If it maintains those speeds it would be one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US south coast. Half a million residents have been told to leave the area. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT)the centre of the hurricane was 65 miles (105km) south east of Port Arthur,externalin Texas. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier hit the Caribbean, killing 24. Marco has already struck Louisiana, bringing strong winds and heavy rain on Monday. Initiallyit was feared that both storms would hit Louisiana as hurricanes within 48 hours of each other- an unprecedented event - but Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm. This video can not be played Hurricane Laura approaches Texas Laura, on the other hand, has strengthened rapidly from a category three, gaining 70% in power in just 24 hours, to a category four, maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). It is now close to becoming a category five storm, which would mean maximum sustained winds of 158mph (254km/h). Hurricane Katrina - which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people - was a category five storm before weakening to a category three when made landfall in the US. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging US President Donald Trumptold those potentially affected by the storm to ""listen to local officials"",externalas the storm was ""very dangerous and rapidly intensifying"". Evacuations are complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged families who could afford it to take refuge in hotels and motels to be distanced from others. Early on Wednesday the NHC said satellite images had shown that Laura had undergone a remarkable intensification to become a ""formidable hurricane"". In a series of tweets, it said Laura was expected to bring ""life-threatening hazards"" and an ""unsurvivable storm surge"" to parts of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Well-built homes could incur major damage, trees could be snapped or uprooted and electricity and water would be unavailable for days or even weeks, it said. ""Hurricane force winds and widespread damaging wind gusts will also spread well inland into portions of eastern Texas and western Louisiana early Thursday,"" the NHC added. Allow Twitter content?

Storm surges of more than 20ft (6m) are possible. In an update at 14:00 local time, the NHC reported 3.2ft of inundation already on parts of the Louisiana coast. ""To think that there would be a wall of water over two storeys high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott. ""The word 'unsurvivable' is not one that we like to use, and it's one that I've never used before,"" he added. Governor Abbott urged people in the path of the storm to ""take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate"". ""The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm's way and protect themselves,"" he said. Laura is expected to reach landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border between midnight and 02:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The National Weather Service has also issueda tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi,external. A man boards up a Louisiana store as the state braces itself for Hurricane Laura More than 420,000 Texas residents have been ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. Port Arthur, Texas, is home to the nation's largest oil refinery, and workers have been taken off at least 310 offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing oil production by 84% for a second day in a row, officials said. Marco and Laura brought high winds and rough seas to the Caribbean, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a baby and an eight-year-old child in Haiti. Heavy rains have also battered parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. President Trump declared a state of disaster in the territory on Saturday. Laura has brought rough seas and high winds to the Caribbean, including here in Havana, Cuba In Cuba, authorities have evacuated at least 160,000 people from several coastal regions, while thousands have been evacuated in the Dominican Republic. In Jamaica, there were reports of landslides and flooded roads. Have you left the area? What is the situation like where you are? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Pent-up demand 'leading to quicker home sales',"Pent-up demand has led to properties taking less time to sell since the height of lockdown, according to research. In the 90 days to mid-August, a three-bedroom home has typically sold in 24 days, property portal Zoopla said. This is 12 days quicker than the same period a year ago. All types of property have been selling faster, its research suggested. People have been reconsidering what they want from a home. One-bedroom flats are now taking the longest to sell at 34 days, although they are also selling much faster than historical norms. The number of property sales in the UK remains low this year owing to the halt put on the housing market at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak. However, there has been a mini-boom since the market reopened in different parts of the UK. Sales agreed on the portal were 76% higher than the five-year average, Zoopla said. ""Buyer appetite has been widely attributed to pent-up demand resulting from lockdown, but it also reflects the impact on the nation as it collectively reassesses what it wants and needs from a home,"" its report said. ""Quarantine has galvanised many homeowners and renters into reconsidering their housing requirements, resulting in demand for more space and changing work and commuting patterns."" That has led to greater demand for larger homes when buyers - often those without the need for a mortgage - can afford it. Eviction ban to be extended by four weeks Fighting to survive the property boom Demand had also been given ""extra impetus"" in London and the south-east England as a result of thetemporary stamp duty holiday, according to Richard Donnell, research and insight director at Zoopla. Rival property portal Rightmove recently said that landlords and owners should show off gardens in marketing photos as house-hunters who have been forced to spend so much more time at home this year increasingly put a  value on space. Pictures of the kitchen had previously been considered key to attracting the attention of browsers. Have you bought a house in the last three months?

"Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday morning.UKDiesel train derailment sparks huge firePeople were evacuated from homes and one person says fuel can be smelled from ""well over a mile away"".Wales","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST. People on low incomes who cannot work from homewill be able to claim Â£13 a day, up to Â£182, if they have to self-isolate under coronavirus restrictions, the government says. However, payments to those who test positive, those in their household and other eligible people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers will only apply in parts of England with high virus rates. City centres could become ""ghost towns"" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage workers back to the office, the head of business lobby group the CBI says. Allowing staff to work from home helped keep firms afloat during lockdown, butthousands of local businesses that rely on passing trade are suffering, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn writes in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the badly-hit aviation market,has reported record losses. Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, if there is a surge in Covid-19 cases this winter, vaccination specialists warn. It comes as BBC analysis of data from English local authorities found thetake-up among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declinedin recent years. In Wales,health officials are reassuring the publicit's safe to attend GP surgeries for jabs. A mother whose 16-year-old daughter has twice had an ankle operation postponed says the pandemicshould not be used as an excusefor pushing back operations. Aisling McCrory says her daughter, Dearbhaile, is in pain every day. She remains on crutches and wears a medical boot, despite several operations on the joint she fractured six years ago. Health trusts say services have been ""significantly disrupted"" by the pandemic. A mini-boom since the property market reopened in different parts of the UK has led to properties selling much faster since the height of lockdown, research suggests. In the 90 days to mid-August, a three-bedroom home hastypically sold in 24 days, 12 days quicker than the same period a year ago, property portal Zoopla said.

"Diesel train derailment sparks huge firePeople were evacuated from homes and one person says fuel can be smelled from ""well over a mile away"".Wales","This video can not be played Investigations begin into railway diesel spill at Llangennech A freight train carrying diesel has derailed and burst into flames, with fuel spilling into a nearby river. About 300 people were evacuated from their homes in Llangennech, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, during the ""major incident"" on Wednesday night. Natural Resources Wales said it was not safe to try and contain a diesel spill which had gone into the River Loughor. A driver and engineer, onboard the train, were not injured and are being supported, owners DB Cargo UK said. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver had noticed something was wrong with the train, which was travelling from Milford Haven. It then derailed and the fire started. The blaze, which was still burning Thursday evening, was reported at about 23:20 BST on Wednesday and police said it had been declared a ""major incident"" due to the ""initial risk of harm"" to people nearby. People living within 800m of the fire described seeing ""plumes of smoke"" and seeing flames from the tracks, when they were evacuated from their homes. They have since been allowed back. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it was carrying out a preliminary examination and gathering evidence. Louise Perkins says she saw a ""massive fire and black smoke"" British Transport Police and Natural Resources Wales said their priorities, once they are able to access the site, were the fire itself and making the scene safe, as well as the environmental issues resulting from the spill. Bill Kelly, from Network Rail, said damage to the infrastructure was significant and would be further assessed by teams ""when it is safe for us to do so"". ""In terms of services this will obviously impact the central Wales line... I don't have timescales just yet on when we're likely to get them running again,"" he added. ""We will be able to continue running freight services using diversionary routes."" Ioan Williams, from Natural Resources Wales, said ""a significant volume of diesel has been spilled... we can confirm there is diesel in the River Loughor itself."" Puma Energy confirmed the third party-operated train was carrying its fuel from Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, to Theale, near Reading, when three tanks caught fire. ""Our immediate priority is to work with the emergency services, Network Rail, environmental agencies and the train operator to ensure public safety is maintained and any possible environmental impacts are mitigated,"" a spokesman said. Puma Energy has not yet confirmed how much fuel the train was carrying, or how much caught fire. The site of the derailment is close to the Loughor Estuary, which is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation. The tankers are being monitored and cooled, the fire service say But Aneurin Cox, duty incident manager for Natural Resources Wales, said it was ""not currently safe"" for workers to get close enough to try and contain the spill while the fire was burning. ""Once it's safe to do so, we will work with our partners to fully assess the environmental impact and advise Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin,"" he said. ""We will also be keeping local angling and cockling groups informed of the latest situation."" The cockle beds in the Burry Inlet - worked by 35 licensed pickers - have been closed following the diesel spill. Robert Griffiths, secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association, said he had been contacted by fisheries officers following a meeting of a number of agencies which monitor the beds. Mr Griffiths said the extent of any diesel pollution was still being assessed and it was hoped the closure would last only a few days. Louise Perkins, who lives close to the railway line, said she grabbed some stuff and rushed from her home with her children, aged seven, 12 and 19, in the middle of the night. The 38-year-old was up late watching TV when she heard an enormous bang: ""There was this massive fire and black smoke. ""As we left it was just fire - you could see like balls of it puffing up, and the smell... the smell of diesel. ""It was just everywhere, and there were just black, black clouds of smoke in the air."" Emergency services had dealt with a ""fast-moving"" and ""large scale"" situation, police say Ms Perkins said she was ""quite worried"" when police explained ""it could explode"". ""At that point my children were up and and they got really distressed,"" she said. Her 19-year-old son went to his friend's house while her two younger children went to their grandmother's. ""They were worried - 'oh, what if our house catches fire, what about all the stuff?'"" she explained. ""I told them not to panic. But my youngest was really upset, she was just heartbroken, she was crying."" The fire started after a number of tanks of the train derailed One Twitter user said,externalthey could smell burning fuel from ""well over a mile away"". Councillor Gwyneth Thomas, a former A&E nurse, was at the scene to offer help if needed and said how ""hugely impressed"" she was by ""how calm"" the emergency service personnel were. ""Some carried young children and others took their dogs with them,"" she recalled. ""It's very fortunate that the accident didn't happen closer to Llangennech [railway] station where there are more homes, and evacuation of residents would have been more difficult."" Sandra Thomas says she was watching TV in bed when police came knocking at her door Sandra Thomas has lived on Pontarddulais Road since 1972 and said nothing like this had ever happened before and the fire went up ""like a bomb"". ""I was terrified - I'm shaking all over,"" she said, adding police knocked on her door while she was watching TV in bed. She was sent to the community centre, but was allowed to return home on Thursday morning. But Ms Thomas became concerned when she looked out of her window at 08:00 to see a large black plume of smoke. ""I don't feel 100% safe in case it sparks off again and the rest of the tankers go up,"" she added. Llangennech is near the Carmarthenshire-Swansea county border, in south-west Wales Speaking at a press conference just before midday, Supt Andy Morgan, of BTP, said: ""While this is an ongoing incident that may go on for some time, we are hugely thankful that no-one has been injured or anything more serious than that has happened here."" When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed. Multiple emergency services and agencies attended The fire has also resulted in delays on passenger trains between Llanelli and Llandrindod Wells in Powys,Transport for Wales said,external. All lines between the two stations have been closed and TfW said it expected disruption on all routes throughout Thursday. Buses will be put on for services affected by the fire. From the Loughor estuary along to the Burry inlet, is an important habitat for wading birds and wildfowl The River Loughor's estuary, along with the Burry Inlet to the west, is designated as a site of special scientific interest Its habitat of tidal mudflats, saltmarsh - the largest continuous area in Wales - and rockpools offer important wildlife habitat Species of wading birds and wildfowl include oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, little egret, widgeon, dunlin, plover and teal The estuary is known for its fishing grounds, for the likes of flounder, bass and mullet Further west, the Burry Inlet's cockle beds are well known, with the industry the third largest in Britain In that same area is the WWT Llanelli wetland centre, a popular place for spotting wading birds and wildfowl and the 450 acres of grounds.

When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed. Multiple emergency services and agencies attended The fire has also resulted in delays on passenger trains between Llanelli and Llandrindod Wells in Powys,Transport for Wales said,external. All lines between the two stations have been closed and TfW said it expected disruption on all routes throughout Thursday. Buses will be put on for services affected by the fire. From the Loughor estuary along to the Burry inlet, is an important habitat for wading birds and wildfowl The River Loughor's estuary, along with the Burry Inlet to the west, is designated as a site of special scientific interest Its habitat of tidal mudflats, saltmarsh - the largest continuous area in Wales - and rockpools offer important wildlife habitat Species of wading birds and wildfowl include oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, little egret, widgeon, dunlin, plover and teal The estuary is known for its fishing grounds, for the likes of flounder, bass and mullet Further west, the Burry Inlet's cockle beds are well known, with the industry the third largest in Britain In that same area is the WWT Llanelli wetland centre, a popular place for spotting wading birds and wildfowl and the 450 acres of grounds.

That's it for our live coverage for today. If you're just catching up with the headlines, here's a taste of what's been going on around the UK. Cases of coronavirus in the UK are on the rise We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly. Thank you for following our coverage
of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world.
They include: The Welsh government has added Singapore and Cuba to its safe travel list, meaning travellers returning to Wales from either destination will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days. In line with the UK government,travellers returning to Wales from Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Jamaica will face quarantine from 0400 on Saturday 29 August, after a spike in infections saw them removed from the UK's established travel corridors, Health Secretary for Wales Vaughan Gething said in a statement.  As Parisians prepare for
the mandatory wearing of masks from Friday, France has reached a new record in
the number of daily infections since lockdown ended in early May. An additional
6,111 people were registered as infected with Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, public
health body DGS says. Forty-eight people died over the past two days. Prime Minister Jean
Castex has admitted there is an ""undeniable resurgence of the
epidemic"", with a national rate of 39 positive cases per 100,000 people,
four times the rate of a month ago. Mandatory face coverings in some
areas - along with an increase in testing - have been introduced to try and stem the
spread of the virus. UK travellers heading to Greece do not currently have to quarantine on return People planning trips abroad face uncertainty, with the ongoing prospect of new countries being added to the UK's quarantine list, often at short notice. Travellers in Switzerland, Czech Republic and Jamaica are the latest holidaymakers to face unexpected quarantine - anyone arriving in the UK from there after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Croatia, Austria, France and Spain have all found themselves on the UK quarantine list over the course of the last six weeks. So which countries are now subject to UK quarantine measures, what's the criteria for adding or removing countries from the list, and which holiday destinations can you still travel to - at present - without being locked down in your own home for two weeks afterwards? We have all the answers for youhere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of daily UK cases of coronavirus has risen to 1,522 in the past 24 hours - the highest tally since mid-June. But this rise needs to be seen in context. While any increase in cases is worrying, we are now
testing more people than we did two months ago. And it follows that the more you look for the virus, the more you will find it. The increase in cases since early July - when the
average rate was half what it is now - cannot be accounted for alone by more
testing, but it is certainly a factor. The other thing to remember is where we have come from. At the peak of the pandemic, we were not able to conduct mass testing, so we don't know exactly how many cases there were. But the best estimates suggest there were around 100,000 new infections every day at the end of March. It is unrealistic to expect cases to fall to zero. What's important now is that we keep beating down the
virus â and limit any increases. That requires identifying hotspots and keeping a lid on
them. All the indications are that the areas that have had extra restrictions
imposed on them in recent weeks have seen a declining number of cases. The
national rise - certainly at this point - is not as alarming as it seems. But
there can be no room for complacency. Hollie Chapman and Wilf Scolding, who play Alice and Christopher Carter, were amongst the first actors back in the studio The cast of BBC Radio 4's The Archers have returned to the recording studio, heralding an end to the series of monologues which some listeners deemed ""dreary"". Over the summer, the long-running rural soap featured characters talking to themselves or holding one-way phone conversations, as Covid-19 forced the cast to record scripts at home. When the episodes debuted in May, some listeners enjoyed the insights into the characters' inner lives but others took umbrage at Ambridge - with one former editor of the show describing it as ""tedious"". The complaints prompted an apology from Radio 4's controller, Mohit Bakaya. ""The challenges were tricky for The Archers; I accept totally that some people have not enjoyed the monologues and I'm sorry about that,""he told Radio 4's Feedback programme last week. ""We're going to start moving back to The Archers we all know and love and I hope that those people, if there are any who have drifted away, will come back to find The Archers... in fine form."" Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices. Good ventilation matters in five ways. David Shukman, BBC News science editor,looks at how the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer. German citizens are being urged not to
travel to countries and regions where the risk of contracting the coronavirus
is high. ""It has turned out that a disproportionately high number of travellers
returning (from high-risk areas) tested positive,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said after a meeting with regional ministers on new quarantine rules. From October, a new digital system will
replace paper documents handed out on flights to better track returnees and monitor
their quarantine obligations. Those who fail to follow the rules could face
substantial fines. Travellers returning from non-essential
travel to high-risk countries may also find they are unable to claim compensation
for lost income during self-isolation. Mandatory testing at airports will continue,
Mrs Merkel said, but the 14-day quarantine rule could be shortened if a
negative test is provided within five days of landing. Majorca is a popular tourist destination Holiday company Jet2 has announced it has cancelled all flights to the Balearic Islands this summer. The low-cost airline and package operator said it had taken the ""difficult decision"" to suspend all flights and holidays to Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca because of ""ongoing uncertainty"" around the pandemic and current UK government advice. UK travellers visiting Spain or any of the Spanish Islands must currently self-isolate for 14 days upon return, after a spike in coronavirus infections. Jet2 said customers would be offered a full refund, a credit note or the option to rebook - with Jet2 promising almost 100,000 additional seats to destinations in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. The company said it remained committed to working with the Balearic Islands, and bookings for summer 2021 were ""looking strong"". Sandwich chain Pret a Manger has announced it will cut 2,800 roles from its shops. Last month, the high street stalwart said it would close 30 stores as part of plans to restructure the business in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite ""clear signs of recovery"" since lockdown measures were eased, Pret said trade across its shops remained around 60% down when compared with last year. Chief executive officer Pano Christou said he was ""gutted"" to be losing so many colleagues. ""The pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret,"" he said, adding that the company had altered working patterns to protect as many jobs as they could. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to review all these changes now that trade is improving again, and I'm encouraged by the improvements we're seeing every week,"" he added. From 08:00 on Friday (06:00 GMT), anyone out in public in the French capital will be required to wear a face covering. This will include people on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and a variety of other mobility vehicles, Paris's mayor has announced. Individual streets and areas in Paris already had rules on wearing face coverings, but the new rules extend to the city's inner ring of Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne. France has seen a surge of Covid-19 cases across the country and  Prime Minister Jean Castex has promised to do everything to avoid another widespread lockdown, including increased testing. Read morehere.  Cuba has been added to the UK's list of countries with whom it shares travel corridors, meaning UK tourists holidaying in Cuba will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days when they return. It follows the UK's decision to add Portugal to the safe travel list last weekend. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps once again reminded UK citizens that they should only travel if they were prepared to unexpectedly quarantine on return. He tweeted that quarantine was ""a legal requirement"" and could result in a fine and a criminal record if it was ignored by travellers. The UK government has announced it is to remove the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Jamaica from the list of travel corridors. A tweet from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said those arriving in the UK from any of the three specified destinations after 0400 on Saturday would need to self-isolate for 14 days. He added that data showed the three countries need to be removed from the list of safe destinations ""to keep infection rates down"".  Allow Twitter content?

By Richard Warry, Assistant Editor, BBC Health Temperature checks and masks are becoming routine for shoppers The U-turn by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on
Covid-19 testing guidelines has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. The agency no longer recommends testing for most people without
symptoms, even if they have been in close contact with an infected person.
Previously it said tests were appropriate for anybody who had reason to believe
they had been exposed. Experts warn that extensive testing is vital to contract tracing
efforts, and controlling the spread of the virus. Some studies suggest that
about half of all transmission is from people who have yet to develop
symptoms. However, the new guidance is no different to that in place in the UK.
Under the NHS test and trace scheme, people who have been in contact with an
infected person are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. A test is only deemed
necessary if they develop symptoms. The rationale is that a single test will
not definitely prove you are clear of the virus if you are in the early stages
of infection, so it is better to wait until there is hard evidence that you are
falling ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested asymptomatic
people may be tested later in the year if new rapid turn-around tests come on
stream. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says tests should
be considered for people âwho have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed
caseâ. However, it accepts this might not always be feasible, and that in low
prevalence settings, it could lead to a higher rate of false positive results,
and may not be cost effective. The UK has recorded a further 1,522 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours,external-  the highest number since the middle of June, according to figures published by the government. It marks an increase of nearly 500 cases in one day, up from 1,048 on Wednesday. But the rise comes amid an increase in testing, possibly accounting for greater case numbers. A further 12 people have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, taking the death toll in the UK to 41,477. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been a total of 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent When schools around the world were closed by the coronavirus
pandemic, it meant families relying on accessing lessons online. But an international report from Unicef shows that for one in
three of the worldâs school children, there was no access to any kind of
distance learning. Henrietta Fore, executive director
of the UNâs childrenâs agency, says this has become  a âglobal education
emergencyâ with the long-term exclusion from education likely to damage
âeconomies and societies for decades to comeâ. The most acute problem has been in sub-Saharan Africa, where about
half of children - about 120 million pupils - have been out of reach of school. When schools closed, so did access to any kind of lessons - and the
report warns the poorest families are most likely to have missed out. About 1.5 billion children around the world saw schools closed by
Covid-19, and now an estimated 463 million have been left without any education to
replace it - either because they had no internet access or because their schools had no
way of providing online or distance learning. Anja Nielsen, of Unicef UK, says even before the pandemic the
digital divide in access to educational technology was already a âmonumental
inequityâ. This has now got worse, she says, and much greater efforts must be made
to âensure that all pupils are able to access learning - within and outside the
school wallsâ. In the US, there's no federal mandate on people wearing masks in airports and on aeroplanes. Instead, it's left up to the airlines to set and enforce their own rules. Although an airline's gate agents can refuse to allow people to board if they're not wearing a mask, once those passengers are on the plane, there's little cabin crew can do beyond threatening to place them on a list banning them from future travel with that carrier. US airline Delta has placed about 240 people on one such ""no-fly list"" for refusing to comply with the company's mandatory mask policy, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees today. ""Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,"" he said in the memo seen by Reuters news agency. One prominent figure to end up on Delta's list was Robert OâNeill, a Navy Seal who was involved in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. He posted a selfie last Wednesday while on board a flight to Newark, New Jersey, in which he wasn't wearing a mask. One of Glasgow's biggest nightclub operators is demanding urgent help to save jobs in the night-time economy. Donald Macleod, who owns the Garage and Cathouse in the Scottish city, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon should ""let us know if you hate pubs and clubs"", as he called for more funding ahead of the winding down of the jobs retention scheme. ""There has been no help coming from the Scottish government to the night-time economy,"" he said, adding that it had ""unfairly"" championed ""elite"" organisations like theatres. The Scottish government said nightclubs posed a risk because they involved prolonged close contact and it supported the extension of the furlough scheme, which is run by the government in Westminster.

Flu vaccination rates prompt complacency warningExperts fear the winter flu season could coincide with a rise in Covid-19 infections.,"Flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable have been falling in the UK Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, experts warn, as data reveals the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme. Last month, the governmentannounced plans to doublethe number of people who receive the influenza jab. But BBC analysis has found the take-up rate among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declined. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not want a flu outbreak ""at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". The government wants to increase the number of people vaccinated from 15 million to 30 million amid fears coronavirus cases will rise again in the autumn. Local authorities in England saw an average 45% of people with serious health conditions under 65 take up the offer of a free vaccine last winter, data shows. That represents a drop from 50% in 2015. The UK government has an ambition to vaccinate 55% of people in vulnerable groups, which includes people with multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes or chronic asthma. The World Health Organization,external(WHO) has previously said countries should vaccinate 75% of people in ""vulnerable"" categories. Public Health England,externalsays the jab -  which in recent years has been freely available to over 65s, those with long running health conditions and pregnant women, among others - is the most effective way to reduce pressures on intensive care units. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government was expanding its flu vaccination programme this year because ""we don't want a flu outbreak at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". ""We have bought more flu vaccine than ever before,"" he said. ""In fact we have changed the law so that more people can administer the jab. We want pharmacists, nurses and GPs to be able to administer the jab."" Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson suffers from the long-term effects of Covid-19 The prospect of a surge in flu cases over winter is also of concern to many people still suffering from what has been dubbed ""long Covid"". That is where coronavirus patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue and breathlessness long after two weeks. Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson, a digital culture and communications student at the University of Liverpool, is one of many long-term Covid sufferers to join a growing online community. The 27-year-old, from Washington in the United States, used to be a keen runner - but now has to take a steroid inhaler and struggles to walk up stairs at her university halls. She said: ""I think getting the flu vaccine is vital now more than ever with the possible co-mingling of Covid and flu. ""I would think about it in the same way as wearing a mask when you go out. It's about mutual respect for people. ""It's more than just your own health - we have to think about everyone in our society."" Dr Tonia Thomas, project manager at the Vaccine Knowledge Trust, which is part of the University of Oxford, said: ""People think the flu is not that bad, that is even for people who are in the risk groups. ""They are leading healthy lives in terms of day-to-day living. I have spoken to patients who say they forgot they are in a risk group. ""It is only when they contract an infection that they realise their body responds differently to other people's."" The uptake rate among over-65s has remained consistent in recent years, however. Last winter, 73% took up the offer. By BBC Health Correspondent Smitha Mundasad Health officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine gets one this year - with around 30 million people being offered them in the UK's largest ever flu immunisation programme. But how will it work? And will things be worse this year? Continue reading here. Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during this year - as a big flu season combined with a fresh surge of coronavirus cases could overwhelm hospitals. Between September 2019 and February this year, almost 8,000 people died from flu in England alone. But the number has varied. In 2017 and 2018, more than 22,000 people died from the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters During the 2019-20 flu season, 3.16 million people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition were vaccinated, 130,000 more than there were five years before. But taking into account factors such as population growth, the proportion of vulnerable people receiving the jab has fallen. Figures from the last winter flu season show local authorities in England averaged just 45%. In Scotland it was 43%, Northern Ireland 52% and Wales 44%. London and the east of England are suffering from particularly low uptake rates among vulnerable patients and in schools. Only 29% of people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition took up the jab in Hammersmith and Fulham last winter. While the government is aiming for a ""universal"" uptake of the flu vaccine among health workers, it has also remained historically low in some parts of the NHS and, in particular, mental health care providers. At West London NHS Trust, which looks after mental health patients in Hammersmith and Ealing, some 1,471 of its 2,880 front-line staff took the jab last winter. ""Our current position remains unacceptably low,"" said Stephanie Bridger, director of nursing and patient experience. ""This year - in the context of Covid-19 - we are redoubling our efforts to promote the critical importance of having the flu vaccination as early as possible."" Professor Heidi Larson says ""apathy"" is the main barrier Prof Heidi Larson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world-leading expert on attitudes towards immunisation and a director of the International Vaccine Confidence Project. While many fear the jab or nasal spray can cause illness, she believes most underestimate the severity of flu. ""I find there is almost a complacency around the vaccine in the UK,"" she said. ""It doesn't have the same aggressive 'anti' sentiment we see against some of the childhood vaccines."" Early surveys carried out by the Vaccine Confidence Project show that, in Europe, there is growing support for the flu vaccine as people are concerned about a second Covid-19 wave. However, Prof Larson said many did not take the vaccine for legitimate reasons, particularly as the nasal spray given to children contains porcine gelatine. It is not suitable for vegetarians and, last year, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was not permitted in Islam except under exceptional health circumstances. ""There are also people that say it doesn't work enough, it's not effective enough,"" Prof Larson added. ""Some years it really isn't that effective against all strains. ""But I would certainly urge people to take it anyway as you wouldn't want the strains that it does protect against. ""It's also so important to limit the stress on the system. ""Two or three years ago the Red Cross had to come in to handle a bad flu season on its own."" Prof Wendy Barclay says health bosses have failed to make an effective case Previous government flu campaigns have also failed to address the ""myth"" that the vaccine can cause illness, according to leading virologist Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious diseases at Imperial College London. She believes this puts many parents off allowing their children to take the nasal spray. In the capital, only 50% of eligible schoolchildren had the free vaccine last winter. Prof Barclay said: ""My issue with Public Health England is if they don't make the message strong enough - so parents think: 'It's only the flu, my kids will be fine'."" Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the UK had some of the best flu vaccine uptake rates across Europe. She said: ""Flu vaccine uptake rates in Europe and the flu vaccination programme will be supported with a major new public facing marketing campaign to encourage take up amongst eligible groups for the free flu vaccine. ""With Covid-19 still likely to be circulating during flu season, it is more important than ever to have the flu vaccination and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer of vaccination to help relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives.""

US hurricane âwill cause unsurvivable storm surgeâHurricane Laura is heading for Texas and Louisiana with wind speeds of up to 150 mph (240km/h).,"More than half a million people have been told to get out of the path of Hurricane Laura Hurricane Laura is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" storm surge, extreme winds and floods as it hits the US, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. The category four storm is approaching Texas and Louisiana with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 miles per hour (240km/h). If it maintains those speeds it would be one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US south coast. Half a million residents have been told to leave the area. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT)the centre of the hurricane was 65 miles (105km) south east of Port Arthur,externalin Texas. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier hit the Caribbean, killing 24. Marco has already struck Louisiana, bringing strong winds and heavy rain on Monday. Initiallyit was feared that both storms would hit Louisiana as hurricanes within 48 hours of each other- an unprecedented event - but Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm. This video can not be played Hurricane Laura approaches Texas Laura, on the other hand, has strengthened rapidly from a category three, gaining 70% in power in just 24 hours, to a category four, maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). It is now close to becoming a category five storm, which would mean maximum sustained winds of 158mph (254km/h). Hurricane Katrina - which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people - was a category five storm before weakening to a category three when made landfall in the US. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging US President Donald Trumptold those potentially affected by the storm to ""listen to local officials"",externalas the storm was ""very dangerous and rapidly intensifying"". Evacuations are complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged families who could afford it to take refuge in hotels and motels to be distanced from others. Early on Wednesday the NHC said satellite images had shown that Laura had undergone a remarkable intensification to become a ""formidable hurricane"". In a series of tweets, it said Laura was expected to bring ""life-threatening hazards"" and an ""unsurvivable storm surge"" to parts of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Well-built homes could incur major damage, trees could be snapped or uprooted and electricity and water would be unavailable for days or even weeks, it said. ""Hurricane force winds and widespread damaging wind gusts will also spread well inland into portions of eastern Texas and western Louisiana early Thursday,"" the NHC added. Allow Twitter content?

""To think that there would be a wall of water over two storeys high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott. ""The word 'unsurvivable' is not one that we like to use, and it's one that I've never used before,"" he added. Governor Abbott urged people in the path of the storm to ""take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate"". ""The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm's way and protect themselves,"" he said. Laura is expected to reach landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border between midnight and 02:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The National Weather Service has also issueda tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi,external. A man boards up a Louisiana store as the state braces itself for Hurricane Laura More than 420,000 Texas residents have been ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. Port Arthur, Texas, is home to the nation's largest oil refinery, and workers have been taken off at least 310 offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing oil production by 84% for a second day in a row, officials said. Marco and Laura brought high winds and rough seas to the Caribbean, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a baby and an eight-year-old child in Haiti. Heavy rains have also battered parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. President Trump declared a state of disaster in the territory on Saturday.

Huge fire after diesel train derails,"This video can not be played Investigations begin into railway diesel spill at Llangennech A freight train carrying diesel has derailed and burst into flames, with fuel spilling into a nearby river. About 300 people were evacuated from their homes in Llangennech, near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, during the ""major incident"" on Wednesday night. Natural Resources Wales said it was not safe to try and contain a diesel spill which had gone into the River Loughor. A driver and engineer, onboard the train, were not injured and are being supported, owners DB Cargo UK said. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver had noticed something was wrong with the train, which was travelling from Milford Haven. It then derailed and the fire started. The blaze, which was still burning Thursday evening, was reported at about 23:20 BST on Wednesday and police said it had been declared a ""major incident"" due to the ""initial risk of harm"" to people nearby. People living within 800m of the fire described seeing ""plumes of smoke"" and seeing flames from the tracks, when they were evacuated from their homes. They have since been allowed back. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it was carrying out a preliminary examination and gathering evidence. Louise Perkins says she saw a ""massive fire and black smoke"" British Transport Police and Natural Resources Wales said their priorities, once they are able to access the site, were the fire itself and making the scene safe, as well as the environmental issues resulting from the spill. Bill Kelly, from Network Rail, said damage to the infrastructure was significant and would be further assessed by teams ""when it is safe for us to do so"". ""In terms of services this will obviously impact the central Wales line... I don't have timescales just yet on when we're likely to get them running again,"" he added. ""We will be able to continue running freight services using diversionary routes."" Ioan Williams, from Natural Resources Wales, said ""a significant volume of diesel has been spilled... we can confirm there is diesel in the River Loughor itself."" Puma Energy confirmed the third party-operated train was carrying its fuel from Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, to Theale, near Reading, when three tanks caught fire. ""Our immediate priority is to work with the emergency services, Network Rail, environmental agencies and the train operator to ensure public safety is maintained and any possible environmental impacts are mitigated,"" a spokesman said. Puma Energy has not yet confirmed how much fuel the train was carrying, or how much caught fire. The site of the derailment is close to the Loughor Estuary, which is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation. The tankers are being monitored and cooled, the fire service say But Aneurin Cox, duty incident manager for Natural Resources Wales, said it was ""not currently safe"" for workers to get close enough to try and contain the spill while the fire was burning. ""Once it's safe to do so, we will work with our partners to fully assess the environmental impact and advise Network Rail when the clean-up of the site can begin,"" he said. ""We will also be keeping local angling and cockling groups informed of the latest situation."" The cockle beds in the Burry Inlet - worked by 35 licensed pickers - have been closed following the diesel spill. Robert Griffiths, secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association, said he had been contacted by fisheries officers following a meeting of a number of agencies which monitor the beds. Mr Griffiths said the extent of any diesel pollution was still being assessed and it was hoped the closure would last only a few days. Louise Perkins, who lives close to the railway line, said she grabbed some stuff and rushed from her home with her children, aged seven, 12 and 19, in the middle of the night. The 38-year-old was up late watching TV when she heard an enormous bang: ""There was this massive fire and black smoke. ""As we left it was just fire - you could see like balls of it puffing up, and the smell... the smell of diesel. ""It was just everywhere, and there were just black, black clouds of smoke in the air."" Emergency services had dealt with a ""fast-moving"" and ""large scale"" situation, police say Ms Perkins said she was ""quite worried"" when police explained ""it could explode"". ""At that point my children were up and and they got really distressed,"" she said. Her 19-year-old son went to his friend's house while her two younger children went to their grandmother's. ""They were worried - 'oh, what if our house catches fire, what about all the stuff?'"" she explained. ""I told them not to panic. But my youngest was really upset, she was just heartbroken, she was crying."" The fire started after a number of tanks of the train derailed One Twitter user said,externalthey could smell burning fuel from ""well over a mile away"". Councillor Gwyneth Thomas, a former A&E nurse, was at the scene to offer help if needed and said how ""hugely impressed"" she was by ""how calm"" the emergency service personnel were. ""Some carried young children and others took their dogs with them,"" she recalled. ""It's very fortunate that the accident didn't happen closer to Llangennech [railway] station where there are more homes, and evacuation of residents would have been more difficult."" Sandra Thomas says she was watching TV in bed when police came knocking at her door Sandra Thomas has lived on Pontarddulais Road since 1972 and said nothing like this had ever happened before and the fire went up ""like a bomb"". ""I was terrified - I'm shaking all over,"" she said, adding police knocked on her door while she was watching TV in bed. She was sent to the community centre, but was allowed to return home on Thursday morning. But Ms Thomas became concerned when she looked out of her window at 08:00 to see a large black plume of smoke. ""I don't feel 100% safe in case it sparks off again and the rest of the tankers go up,"" she added. Llangennech is near the Carmarthenshire-Swansea county border, in south-west Wales Speaking at a press conference just before midday, Supt Andy Morgan, of BTP, said: ""While this is an ongoing incident that may go on for some time, we are hugely thankful that no-one has been injured or anything more serious than that has happened here."" When the blaze broke out, 14 pumps, a foam tender and specialist hazardous material officers were sent to the scene, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Richard Felton said. Firefighters worked through the night and morning to bring the fire under control The three tankers that caught fire were being monitored and cooled, he added. Network Rail has not yet been given permission to clear the site, according to Wales and Borders route director, but his teams are ""ready and on standby"". ""Our main priority will be to ensure there is a minimal environmental impact,"" Mr Kelly added. The site of the derailment is near the Loughor Estuary Supt Ross Evans, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""The evacuation no doubt caused a significant amount of disruption for those evacuated in the middle of the night and I would like to personally thank residents for their response, as well as our frontline officers who swiftly moved hundreds of residents out of their homes,"" he added. Those evacuated had been asked to meet at Bryn School and Llangennech Community Centre, police added. Even from a distance, the strong smell of diesel hangs in the air and this morning the fire seemed to kick off again and thick black smoke began rising from the crash site. I can see the hoses in action where the train is on the tracks, but the view is blocked somewhat by the trees. The fire has since been damped down again and the smoke has turned white again. Gary Jones, a councillor for Llangennech, said the fire ""seemed to die down and then there seemed to be fresh explosions"". ""The height of it was incredible,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. The A4138 was closed for more than 13 hours between Troserch Road to junction 48 of the M4 at Hendy before reopening at Thursday lunchtime. The B4297 between Station Road and the A4138 remains closed. Multiple emergency services and agencies attended The fire has also resulted in delays on passenger trains between Llanelli and Llandrindod Wells in Powys,Transport for Wales said,external.

"Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay emptyLocal businesses and jobs will suffer if workers do not return to the office, says the head of the CBI.Business","City centres could become ""ghost towns"" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage workers to go back to the office, the head of the CBI says. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said allowing staff to work from home had helped keep firms afloat during the pandemic. But as offices stood empty, thousands of local businesses that relied on the passing trade were suffering, she said. It comes as a BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. Writing in the Daily Mail,,externalDame Carolyn said the UK's offices were ""vital drivers"" of the economy, supporting thousands of local firms, from dry cleaners to sandwich bars. ""The costs of office closure are becoming clearer by the day. Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. ""This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities,"" she said. No plan for a return to the office for millions Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan She said getting people back into offices and workplaces should be ""as important"" as the return to school, and directly appealed to Boris Johnson to ""do more to build confidence"". This could include using ""effective test and trace"" systems or a campaign to encourage commuters back on to public transport. In July, the government dropped its formal advice that people should work from home if possible. At the time, Boris Johnson told people to ""start to go back to work now if you can"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Dear customers, I face ruin, please come back' However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. Dame Carolyn acknowledged home working had worked well for many and was likely to remain ""an option"". But she warned of ""serious downsides"" including a lack of opportunities to train young people and foster better work and productivity in certain types of business. The impact on local businesses has also been stark. Sandwich chain Pret a Manger - which relies on a lunchtime work crowd - said in June it was shutting 30 outlets and cutting 1,000 jobs amid a slump in demand. It has also cut its staff's hours. ""It's time for the UK to bring its workplaces back to life or we will look back with regret at the jobs lost, training missed and communities harmed,"" Dame Carolyn said. Some businesses catering to office workers have stayed afloat by adapting the way they operate. Rich Bool, who works for the mobile coffee franchise Cafe2U in Chippenham told the BBC's Wake Up To Money that when offices closed he had to find new ways of approaching his customers. ""Some of that has been actually going to residential streets, where our normal clients ... are at home, working, and asked me to call and deliver to them"". According to Mr Bool, this attracted curious neighbours, who were also working at home and needed a break from the laptop. ""We almost created the new water cooler moment on the pavement,"" he said. Sam Barber, a partner at Workshop, which offers co-working spaces in the centre of Winchester, says she has seen a significant increase in enquiries from people who no longer want to commute to London. She told Wake Up to Money she sees a role for her company in bringing people back into the city centre. ""If we know that we can get people out of their offices, their bedrooms, wherever it is they're working, and into a flexible working space a couple of days a week ...then they're going to be shopping in local shops, they're going to be going to the local coffee shops.""

Trump challenges Biden to drug test before debate,"Mr Trump and Mr Biden will have three live TV debates US President Donald Trump has called for himself and Democratic challenger Joe Biden to submit to drug tests before their first debate next month. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner he had noticed a sudden improvement in Mr Biden's performance in the Democratic TV debates. The president offered no evidence his rival might be on drugs other than to say: ""I'm pretty good at this stuff."" Mr Biden and Mr Trump will have three debates before the 3 November election. Back in 2016, Mr Trump suggested his then-Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had been ""getting pumped up"" before their debates and challenged her to take a drug test ahead of their final live TV encounter. The Clinton camp brushed aside his challenge. On Wednesday, the president - who is set to deliver his keynote address to the ongoing Republican party convention on Thursday - made a similar claim, arguing that Mr Biden's debating ability had improved markedly in the final debate. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... Mr Trump said the former US vice-president ""wasn't even coherent"" during some of the 11 live TV debates he competed in against a crowded field of contenders during the Democratic primary season. By the time of the last debate on 15 March, the field had been whittled down to just Mr Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner,external: ""I don't know how he [Mr Biden] could have been so incompetent in his debate performances and then all of a sudden be OK against Bernie."" This video can not be played Joe Biden earlier this month: 'Why the hell would I take a cognitive test?' He added: ""It wasn't that he was Winston Churchill because he wasn't, but it was a normal, boring debate. ""You know, nothing amazing happened. And we are going to call for a drug test because there's no way - you can't do that."" Mr Trump said of the debates: ""Well, it is a prizefight. It's no different from the gladiators, except we have to use our brain and our mouth. And our body to stand. I want all standing - they want to sit down."" The three presidential debates will take place in Cleveland, Ohio, on 29 September; in Miami, Florida, on 15 October; and Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 October. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Trump asked for extra debates to be scheduled with Mr Biden, but the Commission on Presidential Debates declined. He then asked for the first debate to be held earlier for the benefit of early voters, again to no avail.

Coronavirus strikes endangered Andamans tribe,"Coronavirus has struck a remote tribe in India's Andamans archipelago. Ten members of the Greater Andamanese have tested positive over the past month, a health official told the BBC. Four of them living on a remote island were found to be infected last week, and six others who lived in a city tested positive a month ago. The Greater Andamanese are believed to have a population of just over 50, and mostly live on one of the 37 islands in the coral reef-fringed archipelago. The eastern archipelago of Andamans and Nicobar has recorded 2,985 Covid-19 cases and 41 deaths since its first infection was detected in early June. The first Covid-19 cases among the endangered Greater Andamanese tribe living on Strait Island near the capital Port Blair were detected last week when all its 53 members were tested for the infection, senior health official Dr Avijit Roy told the BBC. Health and emergency workers rode the choppy sea water in boats to the island last week to test the tribe in one day. ""They were all very cooperative,"" Dr Roy said. Two of the infected members of the tribe have been admitted to hospital, while the remaining two have been quarantined in a care centre. Dr Roy said six other members of the tribe who had ""been living and working in the city for a long time"" had been found to be infected with the virus last month. All of them have recovered from the disease. Many of the tribe's members travel between Port Blair and their secluded island, and may have contracted the infection in the process, he said. A few tribe members even do petty jobs in the city. Dr Roy said that making sure the pandemic does not spread among the archipelago's other indigenous tribes was now a main priority. ""We are keeping a close watch on movements and mass testing some of the tribes,"" he said. The Andamans is home to five vulnerable tribes: the Jarawas, North Sentinelese, Great Andamanese, Onge and Shompen. The Jarawas and the North Sentinelese haven't integrated with the mainstream population yet. The North Sentinelese are hostile to outsiders, and no-one is allowed on their island.  In 2018, a US citizen John Allen Chau, wasshot dead with bows and arrowsas he attempted to land there. To see the Jarawas, many tourists take a two-hour bus ride that cuts through the Jarawa reserves According to London-based Survival International,  which works for tribal peoples' rights, the Greater Andamanese numbered more than 5,000 when the British colonised the islands in the 1850s. Suffering from the long term impact of the diseases introduced by the occupation, their numbers dwindled. ""It is extremely alarming that members of the Great Andamanese tribe tested positive for Covid-19. They will be all too aware of the devastating impact of epidemics that have decimated their people,"" Sophie Grigg, senior researcher for the group, said. In 2010, Boa Senior, the last speaker of one of the Great Andamanese languages died at the age of about 85. The islands are often called an ""anthropologist's dream"" and are one of the most linguistically diverse areas of the world. Meanwhile, the 476-odd members of the nomadic Jarawa tribe, who live in a vast forest reserve between the south and middle Andamans, have been already moved and isolated to the farthest part of the jungle after the outbreak of the contagion, officials said. The reason is that officials want to minimise any risk of contact between the tribe members who have little immunity and people travelling for essential and emergency work through the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR) which cuts through the forest reserve. The trunk road, built in the 1970s, is the only road connecting 400 villages from Baratang to Diglipur. Andamans is home to five ""particularly vulnerable"" tribes including the Jarawas and North Sentinelese A team of health workers and doctors is being sent to test more than 115 members of the Ongi tribe who live on one island, Dr Roy said. Members of the Shompen tribe will also be tested. Emergency and health workers sailing to the islands where the indigenous tribespeople live had to clear rapid Covid-19 tests before sailing, and were quarantined for a week on their return. Dr Roy said Covid-19 cases have been detected on10 islands in the archipelago so far. The Andamans has two hospitals, three health centres and 10 care centres for treating Covid-19 patients. They also have one of the highest testing rates in India. Tribes in Brazil and Peru have been hit by Covid-19. More than 280 indigenous people have died with coronavirus across Brazil's Amazon region. US man's death puts spotlight on 'tribal tourism' Who was US man killed in remote islands?

Celtic in earliest Champions League exit since 2005,"Tokmac Nguen scored the winner for Ferencvaros Celtic suffered their earliest Champions League exit in 15 years after falling to a shock defeat at the hands of Ferencvaros in Glasgow. It seemed Neil Lennon's side had recovered from David Siger's early goal for the Hungarian champions when Ryan Christie's deflected strike levelled the one-legged tie. However, Tokmac Nguen's breakaway goal snatched victory for Ferencvaros and ensured Celtic's worst performance in the competition since Artmedia Bratislava knocked them out in 2005. The Scottish champions now drop into the Europa League third qualifying round, the draw for which takes place on Tuesday. Celtic 'only have themselves to blame' Podcast: 'Exit will cost Celtic dear' Reaction & as it happened Questions will likely be asked of Celtic and Lennon, just as they were before kick-off when it emerged leading striker Odsonne Edouard was injured and Christie would be deployed in his place. The manager insisted that fellow forwards Albian Ajeti and Patryk Klimala were only fit enough for the bench. Nevertheless, the hosts looked to have plenty of attacking threat as James Forrest forced an early parry from goalkeeper Denes Dibusz. Ferencvaros head coach Sergei Rebrov had sacrificed striker Franck Boli from their 2-0 win over Djurgardens in the previous round, but his side were not intent on sitting back and replacement Siger made an instant impact. Hatem Abd Elhamed was posted missing as Nguen, who scored a double against the Swedes, broke quickly and fed midfielder Somalia to win a corner. When it reached Siger, the midfielder was allowed too much to time to pick out the far corner from 18 yards. Ferencvaros' lack of match fitness began to tell as they defended ever deeper and Celtic peppered their goal with shots but they were efforts that failed to seriously trouble the visiting keeper. Half-time allowed the Hungarians some respite, but the flow of possession continued after the break and a lovely spell of passing around the edge of the visitors' box ended with Christie's side-footed effort clipping a defender's head and soaring over goalkeeper Dibusz. Dibusz turned a Ntcham volley off the underside of the crossbar and then a low Christie drive wide as Celtic turned the screw. But then came the goal that proved their downfall. Nguen outstripped Elhamed to a long ball out of defence, outmuscled the full-back, and slipped a finish past goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas from a narrow angle. On this evidence, Celtic rely too heavily on Edouard and paid for the French striker's absence. Lennon's experiment of using Christie up front instead of Klimala or Ajeti failed to pay dividends against a side who were only playing their third fixture of the season. Christie did his bit by scoring, but too many other chances were squandered. Ferencvaros have shown in recent European fixtures they are hard to beat away from home - they are now eight unbeaten - but Celtic have lost at home to a side who probably lack the quality to progress much further in the Champions League. Tokmac Nguen (left) has scored three goals in two Champions League qualifiers Celtic manager Neil Lennon:""It was easier than I thought it was going to be. We didn't take our chances and we had plenty of them. The second goal is really poor, really poor decision making, and it's individual mistakes that have cost us again. It's not fine going out at this stage of the competition, because we're better than that."" Ferencvaros head coach Sergei Rebrov:""We have beat one of the best teams we have faced in qualification last year and this year. They have quality players, but I think we deserved this. Most of the time we defended, but football is about scoring goals, not about the possession of the ball."" Celtic are left to reflect on another bruising failure to reach the lucrative Champions League group stage and will look to pick themselves up for Sunday's game at home to Motherwell as they continue their quest to win a 10th consecutive domestic league title.

Schools 'not aware' they can order free tamponsCharities say the scheme should be promoted after less than 40% of schools order free products.UK,"Charities say many schools and colleges are not aware they can order free period products through a government scheme, amid concerns Covid-19 has left more pupils struggling to access and afford tampons and pads. Just under 40% of state schools and colleges have placed orders since it was launched in England in January. The government says the opt-in scheme has operated throughout the pandemic. But campaigners say it should be promoted moreas schools return. Gemma Abbott, from the Free Periods group, said ""many schools and students [are] still not aware"" of the scheme, which aims to help prevent children in colleges, primary and secondary schools missing lessons if they don't have access to products at home. ""The government also needs to take some responsibility for the fact that more than 60% of eligible schools and colleges have yet to sign up to the scheme,"" she said - adding that Free Periods has ""hardly heard anything"" from the Department for Education (DfE) since the initiative's launch. Does my child have to return to school? 'Am I sweating or have I leaked?' Periods, pills & sport Period poverty rises in lockdown, charities say ""If DfE really is committed to ensuring that 'no young person's education is disrupted by their period', as they said back in January, then they need to make much more effort to ensure that schools and colleges know about the scheme, that they place orders for products and that they distribute those products efficiently and sensitively to students who need them."" She added that the government had suggested that the ""opt-in"" nature of the scheme would be reconsidered if there was insufficient uptake. ""If these stats have not improved quite drastically by October half-term, this surely needs to be considered,"" she said. Institutions that opt in can order from a range of items online, via email or over the phone usingan allocated budget for 2020. The DfE said it expects uptake ""to return to pre-lockdown levels"" when children go back to lessons - and that some schools did continue to operate the scheme during lockdown. Benfield School in Newcastle is one of those. It stayed open for keyworker children, but staff delivered products to the homes of pupils who were eligible for free school meals. Benfield School in Newcastle asked its students for their insights on tackling period poverty However, assistant head teacher Sarah Wardle said with schools facing so much turmoil, tackling period poverty may not be a priority or a possibility for others. She thinks making it mandatory for schools to use the scheme - and to educate about periods more broadly - would increase uptake. ""It might be that it needs to come to that so that staff sit up and say 'we need to do something about this',"" she said, adding she expects demand to rise in September. ""Some of our students' parents might have just been earning enough in terms of them not being able to access free school meals. I think one of the issues when we come back is that those people who were just on the cusp might have lost their jobs, might not be working, and there will be a need."" The scheme is demand-led, so uptake is monitored and used to determine spending. Staff at Benfield School in Newcastle have raised the issue of period poverty at parents' evenings Phs Group, which supplies the products for the government's scheme and runs the online portal for orders, said it expects uptake to ""rise considerably"" in September. Warren Edmondson, managing director of phs Direct, called the scheme is a ""major achievement"" in tackling period poverty, but added: ""The onus is now on schools and colleges to claim their free products and orders must be received by the end of the autumn term."" Amika George, who started the campaign to get free period products into schools as a teenager, said the government needs to do more to promote it, particularly as the pandemic has been a ""disaster"" for those who were already struggling to afford products. Amika George ""Household incomes have been squeezed and with so many jobs feeling fragile, children are not even asking their parents for money for pads,"" she said, adding that young people may have lost part-time jobs to buy their own. She wants the government to contact schools and offer help if they are not ordering through the scheme. According to research by charity Plan International, three in 10 girls in the UK have experienced issues either affording or accessing period products during the pandemic, while one in five said their periods have been harder to manage due to the lack of available toilet roll. The charity's Katie Morrison said that while coronavirus is one factor affecting uptake, some schools may not see period poverty as a relevant issue or priority for their pupils. ""Others may want to engage, but don't know how to go about it,"" she said. The charity has released guidance for schools going back in September, which advises on how to deliver free product schemes and to facilitate discussions about what pupils need. The England schememirrors one already rolled out in Scotlandwhich launched last year, following a pilot scheme that gave free tampons and towels to low-income households in Aberdeen. Wales introduced funding for free period products in schools from April 2019 and committed more than Â£3.3m in January this year to tackle period poverty and support period dignity in 2020/21. A spokeswoman for the Welsh government added that before schools and colleges were closed in March, officials directed all local authorities and further education colleges to provide students with three months' supply of products where needed. Onelocal authority in Northern Ireland offers free productsin public places. WILL COVID-19 CHANGE THE WORLD OF WORK FOR GOOD?:Is working from home a long-term solution?

"Chief civil servant sacked after exams rowThe Department for Education's permanent secretary will leave as the PM calls for ""fresh leadership"".UK Politics","The chief civil servant at the Department for Education has been sacked following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. A government statement said Boris Johnson ""concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". But the civil service union accused No 10 of ""discarding"" its members to ""keep scrutiny from the government's door"". Mr Slater is thefifth permanent secretary to leave his post in six months. The news comes a day after the head of exam regulator Ofqual, Sally Collier, also resigned from her role. Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam fiasco Ofqual chief steps down after exams chaos Why have there been so many U-turns? Thousands of A-level studentssaw their results downgraded earlier this monthdue to an algorithm designed to moderate them. It led to a huge backlash and a u-turn by government ahead of the publication of GCSE results, reverting the grades back to those awarded by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faced calls to resign, but No 10 said it had full confidence in him. Mr Slater has been the permanent secretary at the DfE for four years and was due to step down in Spring 2021. He will now be replaced by Susan Acland-Hood, who was brought into the department on a temporary contract last weekto lead on its exam response. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill thanked Mr Slater for his 35 years as a public servant and the government said a permanent replacement would be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mr Williamson also thanked Mr Slater for his ""commitment to public service"", adding: ""Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time."" The education secretary said he and his new permanent secretary's ""immediate focus remains on making sure every child returns to the classroom full-time at the start of term"". The general secretary of the FDA union, Dave Penman, criticised the decision to sack Mr Slater. He said: ""If it wasn't clear before, then it certainly is now - this administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment's hesitation to shield ministers from any kind of accountability."" He accused the government of ""scapegoating"" civil servants and claimed trust between ministers and civil servants was ""at an all-time low"". The Labour Party also condemned the move, saying civil servants had ""time and time again taken the fall for the incompetence and failures of ministers"". Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. ""Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable, qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack."" Former head of the Home Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, who has worked as a Labour advisor, called the sacking ""a disgrace"", telling Times Radio that senior civil servants were ""carrying the can for the failure of ministers"". So, what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy. And now, both a senior civil servant and the head of Ofqual have now departed, while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is now emerging. In February, the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court, claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss, but have nonetheless left their jobs. The most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved, the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure, and it was confirmed last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving too. So, not-so-permanent secretaries seems to be a feature of this administration. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service. In a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is they might be sacrificed for short-term news management, rather than as the result of any strategic master plan. And there is a risk that this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles in the future.

Low-paid people who self-isolate to get Â£13 a day,"The payment will only be available for people who claim benefits Workers on low incomes in parts of England where there are high rates of coronavirus will be able to claim up to Â£182 if they have to self-isolate. From Tuesday, those who claim Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit and cannot work from home will be able to get the money  - equal to Â£13 a day. The benefit will be trialled in parts of north-west England first. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the payment ""goes nowhere near far enough"", adding people need ""full pay"". Employed or self-employed people who test positive for the virus are required to isolate for 10 days, so those eligible for the extra money will get Â£130. But members of the household of someone who has tested positive, who must self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to up to Â£182, assuming they also qualify for the payment. Anyone else who is told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers and meets the qualification criteria will also be entitled to Â£13 a day -about the same as statutory sick pay,external- for however long they must self-isolate. The payment, announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, applies to benefit claimants who live in areas where there are high numbers of coronavirus cases. It comes as the government saida further 12 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,external, taking the total number of virus-related deaths to 41,477. There were a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of 09:00 BST on Thursday, up from 1,048 cases a day earlier. The overall number of people to have tested positive is now 330,368. The scheme will be trialled in Blackburn and other parts of north-west England The England-wide scheme will begin with a trial in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham, wherethere have been tighter lockdown measures after a rise in cases. If the payment is successful it will be ""quickly"" rolled out to other areas where there are lots of cases, the Department of Health said. 'No socialising' rules in parts of North West Commuter towns see sharp rise in benefit claims According to data published earlier this month,nearly 5.5 million people across the UK are now claiming benefits - an 81% increase since March. ""Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks,"" said Mr Hancock. He said the payments had been introduced after feedback from England's contact tracing programme, NHS Test and Trace, and would mean people ""don't lose out by doing the right thing"". ""The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus,"" said Mr Hancock The health secretary told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". Latest figures,externalfor the week to 19 August suggest 72% of people who tested positive were reached by NHS Test and Trace. Those people provided details of more than 24,000 close contacts and just over 75% of those were reached. Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 The data also showed turnaround times for coronavirus tests has increased, with the average wait for results now more than 24 hours for those done at mobile units and testing centres. The government said the rising number of tests being done had created a backlog, which the service was working hard to catch up on. England's NHS Test and Trace service is now three months old - plenty of time to get established and to be judged on. So how is it doing? The key goal was to achieve reach 80% of people who test positive and 80% of their contacts. It has consistently fallen short of that - but only just. Another target is to ensure test results are processed quickly. The fact those waits are getting longer is concerning. The initial design of the service also looks questionable with too much emphasis on the national contact tracing unit rather than local teams. That is now in the process of being rectified with councils establishing their own dedicated tracing teams. But, at the end of the day, the true test of the service - and the wider government's response for that matter - is whether the virus is contained. There have been some signs of an increase in infections in recent weeks - although part of that is likely to be down to extra testing as the more the look the more you find. And if you look at our near neighbours, such as France and Spain, the UK seems to be doing well. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is things could certainly be worse. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had been ""calling for weeks"" for the government to provide financial support for those asked to self-isolate. ""I am pleased they have at last acknowledged this issue but am sorry to say this move goes nowhere near far enough."" ""The health secretary has already said that he couldn't live on Statutory Sick Pay at Â£95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?"" He added that it would not provide the support many workers in Greater Manchester needed to co-operate with NHS Test and Trace and called for the government to enable people ""to self-isolate on full pay"". Mohammed Iqbal, Labour leader of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while financial support was welcome, Â£13 a day was ""a slap in the face"". ""I've spoken to people who have tested positive who I have persuaded to stay home and the kick back from them is to say... 'who is going to put food on the table for my wife and children?', and that is a question we have been pushing back to government for a few weeks now,"" he said. 'This food bank is a lifesaver to me' People will need to provide evidence - including, for example, proof of a positive test, a message from NHS Test and Trace and a bank statement - and the money will be provided within 48 hours, the government said. Mr Hancock said the aim was to get money to people quickly - at the start of their isolation ""rather than afterwards"". The government said checks will be undertaken to make sure people who apply are unable to work from home. The payment will not reduce any other benefits that a person may already receive. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government had encouraged UK ministers to put support in place - but that more detail was needed about how it would be introduced. ""It seems to me to make sense for [payments] to be administered through existing welfare or benefits systems, and obviously we are seeking to understand what the financial consequential position is for the Scottish government,"" she said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Universal Credit payments have been increased by Â£20 a week for the period between April 2020 and March 2021 due to the pandemic, but Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected calls from campaigners to also scrap the benefits cap for the same duration. The benefit cap limits how much any one household can receive in benefits. In other news: Police in England and Wales have seen a 31% rise in assaults on emergency services workers in the four weeks to 2 August, compared to the same period last year. Martin Hewitt chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council said he was ""disgusted"" by the increase at a time when emergency services were on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic The number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England fell slightly in the week to 19 August, down to 6,115 from 6,656 the week before. But it is still the second highest weekly figure since mid-June No new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.

'Scared' patients urged to get flu jabs,"People are being urged to be up to date with their vaccinations Health bosses are hoping to reassure ""scared"" patients it is safe to go to GP surgeries to get vaccinations and flu jabs amid the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdown led to a rolling programme of vaccinations for conditions likes pneumonia and shingles halting. Now people are being urged to get the jabs they missed, as well as flu vaccines when they become available next month. There aresome fearswinter may lead to more Covid-19 cases. Vulnerable groups are being warned they could put themselves at greater risk if they fall ill with conditions such as flu and get coronavirus. ""Vaccinations are some of the most important things that you can do to prevent against those preventable diseases,"" said Teresa Owen, executive director of public health for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. ""They are so important and we want people to optimise their health and, hopefully, we'll reduce the risk of having two conditions at the same time."" Nurse Colette Hughes said vaccination clinics will look different due to extra safety measures Anyone aged 70 to 79 can have a vaccination against shingles, while a vaccine is also available for older people against pneumonia. Young people heading off to university are also being urged to make sure they have all the available vaccinations aimed at preventing meningitis. Meanwhile,Wales' largest ever flu campaignwill allow more people to obtain a vaccination from this autumn. The Welsh Government has set a flu vaccination target of 55% of people under the age of 65 who are in a clinical risk group. How bad will winter really be? How close are we to finding a treatment? Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? But the latest figures from 2019 show none of the 22 Welsh local authorities hit that target. Ms Owen hopes things will be different this year. ""I think there's more awareness of vaccinations this year,"" she said. ""And we certainly want to build on that by making it very easy for people to get their vaccinations."" Special treatment areas have been set up for vaccinations at Panton Surgery in Holywell The Panton Surgery in Holywell, Flintshire, is one practice where staff are keen to reassure the public it is safe for them to receive their vaccinations. Following the lockdown halting of vaccinations for conditions likes pneumonia and shingles, it is now trying to deal with a backlog of up to 200 patients. People are now being urged to come forward and get the jabs they missed. ""People are scared,"" said Colette Hughes, an advanced nurse practitioner. But, she added, everything had been done to reassure patients and to keep them and staff safe. ""It is safe and it is encouraged [to attend] but it will look different,"" she said. Appointments will mean that numbers will be limited at any one time, and as well as social distancing, patients will be asked to wear masks while they are at the centre. They will be expected to leave the building as quickly as they can once they have completed a 10 minute wait to ensure there are no side effects from their vaccination. ""When we do our flu clinics, you'll no longer come into our room,"" said Ms Hughes. ""We'll set up stations in the waiting area with screens for confidentiality and dignity. ""So, it will all look just slightly different but it's there to protect us as staff, the patients that are coming in and it's worked so far."" Patients Beryl McLaren and Roger Vacey have just received their vaccinations Patient Beryl McLaren, aged in her 70s, admits she had her concerns when she was contacted and asked to attend for a vaccination against pneumonia. ""They seemed to have got it organised quite well,"" she said. ""Being an older person, in the vulnerable group, I tend to take more care and anything I can do to protect myself, I will do."" Roger Vacey attended the clinic to get a shingles vaccine. Now 71, he's also had the flu jab every year since he became eligible for it at the age of 65. ""You've probably got to get all the vaccinations you can,"" he said. ""If it helps to protect you, then all the better, isn't it?"" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Christchurch gunman given life without parole,"The victims of the Christchurch massacre A white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand will serve life in jail without parole - the first person in the country's history to receive the sentence. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 29, admitted to the murder of 51 people, attempted murder of another 40 people and one charge of terrorism. The judge called Tarrant's actions ""inhuman"", saying he ""showed no mercy"". The attack last March, which was livestreamed, shocked the world. Tarrant's sentencing also marks the first terrorism conviction in New Zealand's history. ""Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,"" said Judge Cameron Mander in a Christchurch court on Thursday. On imposing a sentence of life without parole, Justice Mander said: ""If not here, then when?"" A sentence without parole means the offender will not be given the opportunity to leave prison after serving only a portion of their total sentence. Justice Mander said such life sentences without parole were reserved only for the ""very worst murders"". New Zealand does not have the death penalty as part of its justice system. Justice Mander had harsh words for Tarrant in his sentencing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, upon hearing of Tarrant's sentencing, said it meant he would have ""no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again"". ""Today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist,"" she said. The shootings prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners. On the last day of a four-day sentencing hearing, Justice Mander spent almost an hour reminding Tarrant of each person he killed and injured. He added that despite the gunman's guilty pleas, the gunman appeared ""neither contrite nor ashamed"". Tarrant, who said through a lawyer in court that he did not oppose the prosecution's application for a life without parole sentence, did not react to the sentence. He had earlier also refused the right to speak at his sentencing. The sentencing hearing began on Monday, with a large part of the first three days dedicated to hearing victim impact statements. Tarrant appeared largely emotionless over the past three days, as almost 90 victims - some grieving, others defiant - confronted him. This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, speaks in court Sara Qasem, whose father Abdelfattah Qasem died at the Al Noor Mosque, spoke of the last moments of his death, saying: ""I wonder if he was in pain, if he was frightened, and what his final thoughts were. And I wish more than anything in the world that I could have been there to hold his hand and tell him it would all be OK."" She struggled to hold back her tears, before looking at Tarrant and saying ""these tears are not for you"". Ahmed Wali Khan, who lost his uncle in the attacks, told the BBC that the Muslim community in Christchurch welcomed the verdict. ""Everyone was quite happy that justice has been served,"" he said, adding that the community had been ""waiting for this decision for a very long time"". Taj Kamran, an Afghan refugee who was shot several times in the leg and still requires walking aids, said he would ""be able to sleep"" after the verdict, though it would not return those who were lost. ""No punishment is going to bring our loved ones back and our sadness will continue for the rest of our lives,"" he told the AFP news agency. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Irfan Yunianto, a doctoral student from Indonesia who survived the shootings, said he was relieved that the gunman had finally been sentenced. ""I was at the shooting location. Many of my friends died. I also saw with my own eyes how my friends were trying to save the victims,"" he said. ""I accept the court decision with good grace,"" he added. ""Following this trial has been really hard, but I still watched it online. After the verdict was reached I felt so relieved because the court finally delivered its final verdict."" Tarrant received the maximum possible sentence in New Zealand, which does not have the death penalty. ""We are not in a country where we can expect the death penalty. But they have served justice, giving the maximum prison time without parole,"" said Hina Amir, 34, who was outside Al Noor mosque when Tarrant began his attack. The gunman opened fire on two mosques in the city on 15 March last year. He first targeted worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque. Less than 30 seconds later, he returned to his car to pick up another weapon and then re-entered the mosque and resumed firing on those inside. The entire incident was broadcast on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot two people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. Two police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, he told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his attack and he wished he had done so. During this week's sentencing, the court heard that the gunman planned to target another mosque but was detained by officers on the way. The 29-year-old white supremacist has been described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as an ""extremist, right-wing terrorist"". He was born in the Australian state of New South Wales to a father who was a garbage collector and a mother who was a teacher. After the death of his father in 2010, he quit his job and travelled through parts of Asia and Europe. His grandmother told news outlet 9News that she believed these travels changed him, saying: ""It's only since he travelled overseas I think that boy has changed - completely to the boy we knew"". Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and started planning his attacks against the Muslim community. He was active on fringe online forums and posted a 74-page ""manifesto"" online prior to his attack. The attack prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme. Mosque witness 'prayed for bullets to end' The people killed as they prayed Ms Ardern has said that ""much more"" needs to be done to stop radicalisation in the country. ""The challenge for us will be ensuring in our everyday actions, and every opportunity where we see bullying, harassment, racism, discrimination, calling it out as a nation,"" she said on the first anniversary of the attacks.

'This food bank is a lifesaver to me',"University student Francis Gichuru also volunteers. ""I like helping other people,"" he says Tens of thousands of people rely on food banks each week for basic provisions, but lockdown forced many to close just as they were needed most. One centre in Northampton remained open against the odds. BBC News spoke to its users and volunteers. It's just gone 10:00 BST and outside one of the units at Weston Favell Shopping Centre, a queue is starting to form. In its previous life as a Next store, that was nothing unusual, but now people are lining up not for fashion bargains but that most basic of essentials: food. Twice a week, an army of masked volunteers meet here, sorting, packing and handing out tins, packets, bags and cartons to grateful recipients. Lockdown saw demand at Weston Favell Centre Foodbank treble, prompting its move from a nearby church to this vacant retail unit on Northampton's eastern edge. Food bank user Susan Austin described the service as a ""Godsend"". ""I'm on Universal Credit and I can't go to work, so this is really important to me. I'd be in the mortuary without it,"" she said. ""I don't get paid until the first of the month, which seems years away. ""I'm here because I simply have no food."" Kiera: ""Everything I get from here, I use"" During lockdown, mother-of-two Kiera found herself on a low income, looking after her disabled partner and struggling to make ends meet. ""This is vital to me; a lifesaver,"" she said. ""I'm on Universal Credit. Everything I get from here, I use. It all makes a big difference when you've not got the money to spend. ""I couldn't afford school uniforms last year and the food bank staff took me to Tesco and helped me."" ""You get lots of soup - I love soup. It's healthy as well. You get the odd packet meal; quick and easy. With a bit of research, you'd be amazed how versatile a tin of tomatoes can be."" Kiera is not alone. Food bank user Michael Harrison is supporting his wife and son Michael Harrison has been visiting the food bank with his son Kenneth for a month now. ""When you're out of work, the low income just about covers the bills,"" he said. ""Trying to find work when you haven't been out of the house is hard. But this makes a lot of difference. ""It takes the stress out of putting food on the table. I can just buy meat myself. The alternative is hunger."" The Trussell Trust reported an 89% increase in emergency parcels through April Last month, the UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, reported an 89% increase in emergency food parcels for the month of April. Food banks in the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) reported a 175% increaseâ¯in need during the same period. BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? ""We are in a different world"": food bank manager Anne Woodley But this lifeline is just emerging from a crisis of its own. Lockdown saw demand rocket but supplies collapse. ""At first, it was hard to get the donations in as we couldn't get to the supermarkets - we felt like criminals,"" said food bank manager Anne Woodley. ""Until they waived the restrictions it was really difficult. ""Prior to that, it was a crisis service: three days' food, just tins. We have now moved into a different world where people are living off food banks.""

""I remember one week where we ran out of food at the end of a Wednesday session. We just about had enough food for that day, and then thought 'what are we going to do for Friday?'"" The food bank went from handing out 120 parcels at the height of the crisis to a more manageable 80 a week, Mrs Woodley said. Back in January, it was 40 a week. Evie Stephens: ""For some people it's a real lifeline"" Volunteer Evie Stephens worked for a charity until she was placed on furlough three months ago. ""I decided to fill my time with something good for the community,"" she said. ""It's been lovely to see the impact on our clients. For some people it's a real lifeline, but the food is just one part of what we give - you see at first-hand the difference it makes. ""It was a bit strange at first, walking around with mask and gloves on, but we are doing the best we can to make everyone safe.""

""If someone finds themselves in difficulties, such as paying bills, sometimes it's food you think of last. ""Initially when lockdown happened it was chaotic. We were inundated with donations and needed to store it all, but on the other side of the coin clients came in because they panicked. The supermarkets were struggling to provide bulk stock and we were relying on the generosity of the public. ""We had to adapt pretty quickly."" Colleague Jayne Redding, a former street church volunteer, said clients came from all walks of life, with many suddenly affected by the Covid-19 downturn. ""We get single people, huge families, people with ageing parents who are shielding and those who are laid off because of Covid,"" she said. ""Sometimes they're embarrassed and worried, but we signpost them to the right place. ""I'm quite an emotional person and it can make me sad, but we can plug this one gap for them.

"Low-paid people who self-isolate to get Â£13 a dayIn England, people on low incomes self-isolating in areas where coronavirus cases are high will get help.UK","The payment will only be available for people who claim benefits Workers on low incomes in parts of England where there are high rates of coronavirus will be able to claim up to Â£182 if they have to self-isolate. From Tuesday, those who claim Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit and cannot work from home will be able to get the money  - equal to Â£13 a day. The benefit will be trialled in parts of north-west England first. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the payment ""goes nowhere near far enough"", adding people need ""full pay"". Employed or self-employed people who test positive for the virus are required to isolate for 10 days, so those eligible for the extra money will get Â£130. But members of the household of someone who has tested positive, who must self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to up to Â£182, assuming they also qualify for the payment. Anyone else who is told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers and meets the qualification criteria will also be entitled to Â£13 a day -about the same as statutory sick pay,external- for however long they must self-isolate. The payment, announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, applies to benefit claimants who live in areas where there are high numbers of coronavirus cases. It comes as the government saida further 12 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,external, taking the total number of virus-related deaths to 41,477. There were a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of 09:00 BST on Thursday, up from 1,048 cases a day earlier. The overall number of people to have tested positive is now 330,368. The scheme will be trialled in Blackburn and other parts of north-west England The England-wide scheme will begin with a trial in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham, wherethere have been tighter lockdown measures after a rise in cases. If the payment is successful it will be ""quickly"" rolled out to other areas where there are lots of cases, the Department of Health said. 'No socialising' rules in parts of North West Commuter towns see sharp rise in benefit claims According to data published earlier this month,nearly 5.5 million people across the UK are now claiming benefits - an 81% increase since March. ""Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks,"" said Mr Hancock. He said the payments had been introduced after feedback from England's contact tracing programme, NHS Test and Trace, and would mean people ""don't lose out by doing the right thing"". ""The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus,"" said Mr Hancock The health secretary told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace was now reaching ""almost 80%"" of contacts and the extra support will help ""get the last few percentages"". Latest figures,externalfor the week to 19 August suggest 72% of people who tested positive were reached by NHS Test and Trace. Those people provided details of more than 24,000 close contacts and just over 75% of those were reached. Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 The data also showed turnaround times for coronavirus tests has increased, with the average wait for results now more than 24 hours for those done at mobile units and testing centres. The government said the rising number of tests being done had created a backlog, which the service was working hard to catch up on. England's NHS Test and Trace service is now three months old - plenty of time to get established and to be judged on. So how is it doing? The key goal was to achieve reach 80% of people who test positive and 80% of their contacts. It has consistently fallen short of that - but only just. Another target is to ensure test results are processed quickly. The fact those waits are getting longer is concerning. The initial design of the service also looks questionable with too much emphasis on the national contact tracing unit rather than local teams. That is now in the process of being rectified with councils establishing their own dedicated tracing teams. But, at the end of the day, the true test of the service - and the wider government's response for that matter - is whether the virus is contained. There have been some signs of an increase in infections in recent weeks - although part of that is likely to be down to extra testing as the more the look the more you find. And if you look at our near neighbours, such as France and Spain, the UK seems to be doing well. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is things could certainly be worse. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had been ""calling for weeks"" for the government to provide financial support for those asked to self-isolate. ""I am pleased they have at last acknowledged this issue but am sorry to say this move goes nowhere near far enough."" ""The health secretary has already said that he couldn't live on Statutory Sick Pay at Â£95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?"" He added that it would not provide the support many workers in Greater Manchester needed to co-operate with NHS Test and Trace and called for the government to enable people ""to self-isolate on full pay"". Mohammed Iqbal, Labour leader of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while financial support was welcome, Â£13 a day was ""a slap in the face"". ""I've spoken to people who have tested positive who I have persuaded to stay home and the kick back from them is to say... 'who is going to put food on the table for my wife and children?', and that is a question we have been pushing back to government for a few weeks now,"" he said. 'This food bank is a lifesaver to me' People will need to provide evidence - including, for example, proof of a positive test, a message from NHS Test and Trace and a bank statement - and the money will be provided within 48 hours, the government said. Mr Hancock said the aim was to get money to people quickly - at the start of their isolation ""rather than afterwards"". The government said checks will be undertaken to make sure people who apply are unable to work from home. The payment will not reduce any other benefits that a person may already receive. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government had encouraged UK ministers to put support in place - but that more detail was needed about how it would be introduced. ""It seems to me to make sense for [payments] to be administered through existing welfare or benefits systems, and obviously we are seeking to understand what the financial consequential position is for the Scottish government,"" she said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Universal Credit payments have been increased by Â£20 a week for the period between April 2020 and March 2021 due to the pandemic, but Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has rejected calls from campaigners to also scrap the benefits cap for the same duration. The benefit cap limits how much any one household can receive in benefits. In other news: Police in England and Wales have seen a 31% rise in assaults on emergency services workers in the four weeks to 2 August, compared to the same period last year. Martin Hewitt chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council said he was ""disgusted"" by the increase at a time when emergency services were on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic The number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England fell slightly in the week to 19 August, down to 6,115 from 6,656 the week before. But it is still the second highest weekly figure since mid-June No new coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. It comes after the first deaths following a positive test in the nation for six weeks wereannounced on Wednesday The take up of the flu jab among people in vulnerable groups has declined, according to BBC analysis, despite plans to double the number of people who receive it.

Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Washington DC Weâve been in Johnstown, Pennsylvania - what has become the heart of Trump country. For generations, this historic steel town reliably voted for Democrats - but that all changed with President Trumpâs surprise victory here in 2016. Jackie Kulback, a local Republican official, said before Trump, the Republican party âwas really good at losing.â But now, theyâve had to add extra hours to the local party headquarters to accommodate the surge in voter interest and enthusiasm. Construction company owner James Vasilko says ""there's no way"" Joe Biden will win And that same surge is also dramatically reshaping the stateâs political landscape. In the last year alone, election officials here said more than 47,000 voters have changed their registration from Democrat to Republican - a permanent sign of support for Trump. And though the president may be behind in national polls, his support here appears to be undimmed. âIt used to be the building unions, the working man, were all Democrats,â said James Vasilko, a proud Republican who owns a local construction company. âNow, the working guys realise what President Trump has done for all of us.â Campaigning is fierce in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than a 1% margin Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by an incredibly narrow margin - less than one percent. And though Pennsylvania is former Vice-President Joe Bidenâs home state, this small rust belt city is brimming with confidence about Trumpâs chances in November. Mr Vasilko said, âI do not think there's any possible way that the Biden/Harris ticket can win.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played For three and a half years, Vice-President Mike Pence has been Donald Trumpâs most loyal sidekick â extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Penceâs mission was to pitch for the presidentâs re-election by touting his accomplishments, attacking his Democratic opponent and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. âHeâs certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly heâs kept his word,â he said. Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance â talking up the presidentâs record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. Pence tried to cast this âtime of testing,â as he put it, in the best light. âWe are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again,â he said. Pence drew a sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who he said would âset America on a path of socialism and declineâ. âYou wonât be safe in Joe Bidenâs America,â Pence added, in case his point wasnât clear. And in a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: âThe choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right â and wrong â with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Mr Trump mingled with supporters after Pence spoke President Trump, who is not slated to speak until he gives his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination, has just taken the stage. After he arrives with First Lady Melania Trump to the sound of ""Hail to the Chief"", country star Trace Atkins begins singing the US national anthem. The First and Second couples then mingled with supporters from behind a short divider and took selfies. The live feed of the event showed very few people wearing masks, and Pence fist-bumping with some people in the crowd. In a word: no. That's despite a claim from Vice-President Pence this evening. Pence said that Joe Biden ""has pledged to defund the police"". Adovcates of ""defunding"" want police departments' budgets to be slashed and the funds diverted to social programmes. But in an interview with CBS News in June, Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential nominee) said: ""I don't support defunding the policeâ. Instead, Mr Biden is backing police reform.
He has said: ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms"". He has pledged to devote $300m to community policing. Vice-President Mike Pence was one of the few speakers tonight to address the pandemic. He praised President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the end of January after the first coronavirus case was reported in the US. ""That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilisation since World War 2,"" he told supporters. While Pence went on to tout a partnership with private industry to ""reinvent testing"", critics say any time that travel ban bought was quickly wasted because of a series of errors and inaction. In this video, we explored the lost six weeks that allowed the virus to spread across the country. This video can not be played Pence has demanded law and order in his speech from Baltimore. ""Let me be clear: the violence must stop - whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,"" he says, referring to the protests that have erupted just this past week in Kenosha in the wake ofanother police killing of a black man. ""Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans
strike each other down. ""We will have law and order on the streets of America. ""We're not going to defund police. Not now. Not ever,"" he adds. Here's what Joe Biden had to say about the protests in an interview earlier today: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary. But burning down communities is not protest, it's needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. ""That's wrong,"" he added. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent If the past is the prologue to the future then
four more years of President Trump will be four more years of âAmerica firstâ;
four more years of the weakening of the international order; and four more
years of incoherence and bluster in US foreign policy. Beyond the meandering tweet storms, nothing has emerged that you could really call a Trump doctrine. Opposition to Americaâs âforever warsâ is popular at home and a second Trump
term could see US troops withdrawn from a number of trouble spots. Pressure on US
allies in crude terms, to âpay their wayâ, will continue. But the question
remains: does this strengthen or weaken alliances upon which the US depends for
its preeminent place on the global stage? Policy towards Russia and, crucially, China may continue to lack any real guiding principle. 'Strategic rivalry' may
grow, but Washingtonâs overall position may become weaker. Trumpâs first
term has been good for the strong men and despots of global politics. There
seems no reason that this should change during his second.  According to Pence, Trump has ""stood up to our enemies and weâve stood with our allies"". Under Trump's leadership, he says, ""American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty."" Pence paints a contrast to Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, saying that Biden opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden, conducted under the Obama administration. This account has been disputed by Biden, who has insisted he expressed scepticism, but ultimately supported Obama's decision. Pence goes further - repeating a claim from the memoir of Obama-era secretary of defence Bob Gates, that Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". Pence is describing the president as a man that fights back in the face of critics. ""For the last four years, I
have watched this president endure unrelenting attacks and get up
every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people,"" he says. He notes that under Trump, territories under control of the terror group Isis - a group he points out once controlled ""a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania"" - were taken back. Trump ""sees America for what it
is; a nation that has done more good in this world than any other,"" he says. It is ""a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,
then heâs not your man,"" he says. The vice-president has stepped out at Fort McHenry to chants of ""four more years"" from a small crowd, spaced apart for social distancing. Flanked by over a dozen US flags, Pence speaks of his 'gratitude for the confidence the president has placed in me,' as he accepts the nomination for the Trump-Pence 2020 Republican ticket. A visibly emotional Karen Pence sits in the audience next to some of the Pence children, and the vice-president's mother is there as well. He jokes: 'Sometimes I actually think I'm her second favourite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket'. Vice-president Mike Pence takes to the stage at historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He begins by noting how the fort withstood a British onslaught 206 years ago, and criticising Democrats for ""attacking America"" at their party convention last week. There are a lot of high-profile Republicans speaking tonight, and many of them have referenced the 19th amendment in the United States - ratified 100 years ago, it granted women the right to vote. What do American voters think of this historic anniversary? The BBCâs Shrai Popat asked a number of women running for office. Texan Beth Van Duyne, a candidate for Congress, said: ""I think about how far we have come,"" Van Duyne said. ""It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year."" Read more about what some female candidates - both Republican and Democrat - think about what has been achieved and what is left to do. What kind of vice-president is Mike Pence? On the one hand, he does a lot of the typical tasks associated with
modern VPs like the advising, the communications, the weekly lunch with the
president and the foreign travel, says Joel Goldstein, a professor of law at St
Louis University who has written books about the vice-presidency. But on the other hand, Pence has the unique challenge of deputising for a
president who is like no other. That means he often finds himself
cleaning up a controversy, saying Donald Trump hasnât said what heâs said, and
rephrasing it. But whereas all VPs end up being salespeople for the president, Pence
has taken that to new levels, says Mr Goldstein. âHe says President Trump is
going to be the best friend the military has ever had, things like that. There
are no limits on the bounds of his praise for the president.â Perhaps Pence would act differently if he was serving under one of the
Bushes or another Republican president, he adds. Trump is a man who doesnât
like to be challenged. âHe wants to have people sit there in a public meeting singing his
praises, and Pence has been willing to do that. But when you do that, it
demeans the vice-president and also demeans the office.â Mike Pence: From Indiana to the White House Lara Trump made an eyebrow raising claim in her speech just now, when she said Mr Trump appointed the ""secretary of the United Nations"". ""It didnât surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed
the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history,"" she said. ""The
Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female
CIA Director..."" The UN general secretary is appointed by the UN General Assembly members, not the US president. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has confirmed that President Trump has just arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he is apparently accompanying his vice-president, Mike Pence, who is due to give a keynote speech there within the next 45 minutes. Lara Trump - Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to the president's re-election team - is up now. The mother-of-two has been married to Trump's second son, Eric Trump, since 2014. And since joining the Trump family, the 37-year-old has proven to be a loyal supporter of the elder Trump's political career. During the 2016 election, she led the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment tour, a role she has reprised the second time around. Lara Trump has established herself as a top spokesperson for the president, traveling around the country and holding ""MAGA mommy"" gatherings as part of the ""Women for Trump"" initiative. It's a crucial role: white suburban women were key to delivering the White House to Trump in 2016, and he'll need that support again. She has promised to keep a ""hopeful and inspirational and patriotic"" tone at tonight's event. We've also heard from Madison
Cawthorn, a congressional candidate from North Carolina, running for his first term this November. If he wins, the 25-year-old would be the youngest congressman elected in over 200 years. Cawthorn had his athletic dreams derailed after a car accident left him paralysed. Sitting in a wheelchair, the young Republican made a charismatic pitch for his own candidacy as he also gave his support to Trump. ""I was given a one percent chance of surviving. Thanks to the power of prayer, a loving community, and skilled doctors, I made it,"" he said. ""At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference,"" he says. ""In 2020, our country has a choice. We can give up on the American idea, or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect."" ""While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trumpâs leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew."" He capped his appearance by standing up, with the aid of a support, from his chair, in what will surely be a re-played moment from the convention. His is an important pitch: support from young people like Cawthorn is currently lacking for President Trump. A poll from the Harvard Kennedy School in April showed 18- to 29-year-olds supporting Democratic candidate Joe Biden by a margin of 23 points. Â© 2025 BBC.

Trump challenges Biden to drug test before debateThe president claims Mr Biden went from incoherent to articulate in a previous debate.,"Mr Trump and Mr Biden will have three live TV debates US President Donald Trump has called for himself and Democratic challenger Joe Biden to submit to drug tests before their first debate next month. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner he had noticed a sudden improvement in Mr Biden's performance in the Democratic TV debates. The president offered no evidence his rival might be on drugs other than to say: ""I'm pretty good at this stuff."" Mr Biden and Mr Trump will have three debates before the 3 November election. Back in 2016, Mr Trump suggested his then-Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had been ""getting pumped up"" before their debates and challenged her to take a drug test ahead of their final live TV encounter. The Clinton camp brushed aside his challenge. On Wednesday, the president - who is set to deliver his keynote address to the ongoing Republican party convention on Thursday - made a similar claim, arguing that Mr Biden's debating ability had improved markedly in the final debate. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... Mr Trump said the former US vice-president ""wasn't even coherent"" during some of the 11 live TV debates he competed in against a crowded field of contenders during the Democratic primary season. By the time of the last debate on 15 March, the field had been whittled down to just Mr Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner,external: ""I don't know how he [Mr Biden] could have been so incompetent in his debate performances and then all of a sudden be OK against Bernie."" This video can not be played Joe Biden earlier this month: 'Why the hell would I take a cognitive test?' He added: ""It wasn't that he was Winston Churchill because he wasn't, but it was a normal, boring debate. ""You know, nothing amazing happened. And we are going to call for a drug test because there's no way - you can't do that."" Mr Trump said of the debates: ""Well, it is a prizefight. It's no different from the gladiators, except we have to use our brain and our mouth. And our body to stand. I want all standing - they want to sit down."" The three presidential debates will take place in Cleveland, Ohio, on 29 September; in Miami, Florida, on 15 October; and Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 October. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Trump asked for extra debates to be scheduled with Mr Biden, but the Commission on Presidential Debates declined. He then asked for the first debate to be held earlier for the benefit of early voters, again to no avail. Both Mr Trump, 74, and Mr Biden, 77, have each traded gibes that the other is suffering from dementia. The Biden team is yet to respond to Mr Trump's remarks.

Some restaurants extend Eat Out scheme to SeptemberThey say they will use their own money to continue offering discounts when the government promotion ends.Business,"A Pizza Pilgrims restaurant in Belgravia Restaurants say they will continue to offer the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in September, funding it themselves, because it has been so successful. The government scheme offers customers 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 during August. But chains such as Pizza Pilgrims now say they will offer the discount next month too. The aim is to draw people nervous about coronavirus back to restaurants at a time when many are struggling. Some 84,000 restaurants, cafes and bars have signed up to the government's scheme, which runs on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. According to thelatest Treasury figures, diners used it more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks - equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out. Data shows only 27% of UK consumers feel safe eating at a restaurant Commercial landlord Grosvenor - which owns property across central London - said it would reduce rents for tenants that continue to offer diners half-price meals until the end of September. High end restaurants Comptoir and Roka, the Thomas Cubitt pub and Peggy Porschen cafÃ© are among those to sign up. ""Eat Out to Help Out has been a powerful tool in protecting jobs and local economies UK-wide and we are working hard to help the West End and our tenants recover,"" said Amelia Bright, executive director of Grosvenor's London estate. ""Continuing it will not only support cafes, restaurants and bars that we lease space to but also help welcome back more visitors and workers to Mayfair and Belgravia."" How does the scheme work? The highs and lows of the coronavirus discount scheme 'We've had 15,000 bookings' Eat Out to Help Out discount used 64m times in three weeks Others say they will offer different discounts inspired by the scheme. Spanish City, a steak and seafood restaurant in Whitley Bay, told the BBC it would offer a 25% discount on all food and non-alcoholic drinks on Monday to Wednesdays, with no cap on spending. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus. Boss Kate Nicholls welcomed the move by individual restaurants to extend the Eat Out scheme, saying it had been ""a huge success"". ""The hospitality sector is still fragile and faces other challenges, but prolonging the Eat Out scheme could help businesses back to stability and enable them to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,"" she said. A growing list of restaurant chains have had to announce closures in recent months includingPizza Express,Byron Burgerand Frankie & Benny's-owner the Restaurant Group. Spend for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% And on Wednesday, Mexican chain Wahaca said it was closing 10 of its 25 restaurants, and that it would ""try to save jobs"" wherever possible. Spanish City's operations director Rob Smith told the BBC the Eat Out scheme had boosted its sales, but he remains cautious. ""We're forecasting being down about 25-30% for the rest of the year, and we're having to catch up on the three months we lost out - it's still very nervous times for the industry.""

For generations, this historic steel town reliably voted for Democrats - but that all changed with President Trumpâs surprise victory here in 2016. Jackie Kulback, a local Republican official, said before Trump, the Republican party âwas really good at losing.â But now, theyâve had to add extra hours to the local party headquarters to accommodate the surge in voter interest and enthusiasm. Construction company owner James Vasilko says ""there's no way"" Joe Biden will win And that same surge is also dramatically reshaping the stateâs political landscape. In the last year alone, election officials here said more than 47,000 voters have changed their registration from Democrat to Republican - a permanent sign of support for Trump. And though the president may be behind in national polls, his support here appears to be undimmed. âIt used to be the building unions, the working man, were all Democrats,â said James Vasilko, a proud Republican who owns a local construction company. âNow, the working guys realise what President Trump has done for all of us.â Campaigning is fierce in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than a 1% margin Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by an incredibly narrow margin - less than one percent. And though Pennsylvania is former Vice-President Joe Bidenâs home state, this small rust belt city is brimming with confidence about Trumpâs chances in November. Mr Vasilko said, âI do not think there's any possible way that the Biden/Harris ticket can win.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played For three and a half years, Vice-President Mike Pence has been Donald Trumpâs most loyal sidekick â extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Penceâs mission was to pitch for the presidentâs re-election by touting his accomplishments, attacking his Democratic opponent and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. âHeâs certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly heâs kept his word,â he said. Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance â talking up the presidentâs record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. Pence tried to cast this âtime of testing,â as he put it, in the best light. âWe are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again,â he said. Pence drew a sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who he said would âset America on a path of socialism and declineâ. âYou wonât be safe in Joe Bidenâs America,â Pence added, in case his point wasnât clear. And in a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: âThe choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right â and wrong â with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Mr Trump mingled with supporters after Pence spoke President Trump, who is not slated to speak until he gives his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination, has just taken the stage. After he arrives with First Lady Melania Trump to the sound of ""Hail to the Chief"", country star Trace Atkins begins singing the US national anthem. The First and Second couples then mingled with supporters from behind a short divider and took selfies. The live feed of the event showed very few people wearing masks, and Pence fist-bumping with some people in the crowd. In a word: no. That's despite a claim from Vice-President Pence this evening. Pence said that Joe Biden ""has pledged to defund the police"". Adovcates of ""defunding"" want police departments' budgets to be slashed and the funds diverted to social programmes. But in an interview with CBS News in June, Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential nominee) said: ""I don't support defunding the policeâ. Instead, Mr Biden is backing police reform.
He has said: ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms"". He has pledged to devote $300m to community policing. Vice-President Mike Pence was one of the few speakers tonight to address the pandemic. He praised President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the end of January after the first coronavirus case was reported in the US. ""That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilisation since World War 2,"" he told supporters. While Pence went on to tout a partnership with private industry to ""reinvent testing"", critics say any time that travel ban bought was quickly wasted because of a series of errors and inaction. In this video, we explored the lost six weeks that allowed the virus to spread across the country. This video can not be played Pence has demanded law and order in his speech from Baltimore. ""Let me be clear: the violence must stop - whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,"" he says, referring to the protests that have erupted just this past week in Kenosha in the wake ofanother police killing of a black man. ""Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans
strike each other down. ""We will have law and order on the streets of America. ""We're not going to defund police. Not now. Not ever,"" he adds. Here's what Joe Biden had to say about the protests in an interview earlier today: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary. But burning down communities is not protest, it's needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. ""That's wrong,"" he added. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent If the past is the prologue to the future then
four more years of President Trump will be four more years of âAmerica firstâ;
four more years of the weakening of the international order; and four more
years of incoherence and bluster in US foreign policy. Beyond the meandering tweet storms, nothing has emerged that you could really call a Trump doctrine. Opposition to Americaâs âforever warsâ is popular at home and a second Trump
term could see US troops withdrawn from a number of trouble spots. Pressure on US
allies in crude terms, to âpay their wayâ, will continue. But the question
remains: does this strengthen or weaken alliances upon which the US depends for
its preeminent place on the global stage? Policy towards Russia and, crucially, China may continue to lack any real guiding principle. 'Strategic rivalry' may
grow, but Washingtonâs overall position may become weaker. Trumpâs first
term has been good for the strong men and despots of global politics. There
seems no reason that this should change during his second.  According to Pence, Trump has ""stood up to our enemies and weâve stood with our allies"". Under Trump's leadership, he says, ""American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty."" Pence paints a contrast to Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, saying that Biden opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden, conducted under the Obama administration. This account has been disputed by Biden, who has insisted he expressed scepticism, but ultimately supported Obama's decision. Pence goes further - repeating a claim from the memoir of Obama-era secretary of defence Bob Gates, that Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". Pence is describing the president as a man that fights back in the face of critics. ""For the last four years, I
have watched this president endure unrelenting attacks and get up
every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people,"" he says. He notes that under Trump, territories under control of the terror group Isis - a group he points out once controlled ""a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania"" - were taken back. Trump ""sees America for what it
is; a nation that has done more good in this world than any other,"" he says. It is ""a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,
then heâs not your man,"" he says. The vice-president has stepped out at Fort McHenry to chants of ""four more years"" from a small crowd, spaced apart for social distancing. Flanked by over a dozen US flags, Pence speaks of his 'gratitude for the confidence the president has placed in me,' as he accepts the nomination for the Trump-Pence 2020 Republican ticket. A visibly emotional Karen Pence sits in the audience next to some of the Pence children, and the vice-president's mother is there as well. He jokes: 'Sometimes I actually think I'm her second favourite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket'. Vice-president Mike Pence takes to the stage at historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He begins by noting how the fort withstood a British onslaught 206 years ago, and criticising Democrats for ""attacking America"" at their party convention last week. There are a lot of high-profile Republicans speaking tonight, and many of them have referenced the 19th amendment in the United States - ratified 100 years ago, it granted women the right to vote. What do American voters think of this historic anniversary? The BBCâs Shrai Popat asked a number of women running for office. Texan Beth Van Duyne, a candidate for Congress, said: ""I think about how far we have come,"" Van Duyne said. ""It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year."" Read more about what some female candidates - both Republican and Democrat - think about what has been achieved and what is left to do. What kind of vice-president is Mike Pence? On the one hand, he does a lot of the typical tasks associated with
modern VPs like the advising, the communications, the weekly lunch with the
president and the foreign travel, says Joel Goldstein, a professor of law at St
Louis University who has written books about the vice-presidency. But on the other hand, Pence has the unique challenge of deputising for a
president who is like no other. That means he often finds himself
cleaning up a controversy, saying Donald Trump hasnât said what heâs said, and
rephrasing it. But whereas all VPs end up being salespeople for the president, Pence
has taken that to new levels, says Mr Goldstein. âHe says President Trump is
going to be the best friend the military has ever had, things like that. There
are no limits on the bounds of his praise for the president.â Perhaps Pence would act differently if he was serving under one of the
Bushes or another Republican president, he adds. Trump is a man who doesnât
like to be challenged. âHe wants to have people sit there in a public meeting singing his
praises, and Pence has been willing to do that. But when you do that, it
demeans the vice-president and also demeans the office.â Mike Pence: From Indiana to the White House Lara Trump made an eyebrow raising claim in her speech just now, when she said Mr Trump appointed the ""secretary of the United Nations"". ""It didnât surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed
the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history,"" she said. ""The
Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female
CIA Director..."" The UN general secretary is appointed by the UN General Assembly members, not the US president. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has confirmed that President Trump has just arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he is apparently accompanying his vice-president, Mike Pence, who is due to give a keynote speech there within the next 45 minutes. Lara Trump - Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to the president's re-election team - is up now. The mother-of-two has been married to Trump's second son, Eric Trump, since 2014. And since joining the Trump family, the 37-year-old has proven to be a loyal supporter of the elder Trump's political career. During the 2016 election, she led the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment tour, a role she has reprised the second time around. Lara Trump has established herself as a top spokesperson for the president, traveling around the country and holding ""MAGA mommy"" gatherings as part of the ""Women for Trump"" initiative. It's a crucial role: white suburban women were key to delivering the White House to Trump in 2016, and he'll need that support again. She has promised to keep a ""hopeful and inspirational and patriotic"" tone at tonight's event. We've also heard from Madison
Cawthorn, a congressional candidate from North Carolina, running for his first term this November. If he wins, the 25-year-old would be the youngest congressman elected in over 200 years. Cawthorn had his athletic dreams derailed after a car accident left him paralysed. Sitting in a wheelchair, the young Republican made a charismatic pitch for his own candidacy as he also gave his support to Trump. ""I was given a one percent chance of surviving. Thanks to the power of prayer, a loving community, and skilled doctors, I made it,"" he said. ""At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference,"" he says. ""In 2020, our country has a choice. We can give up on the American idea, or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect."" ""While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trumpâs leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew."" He capped his appearance by standing up, with the aid of a support, from his chair, in what will surely be a re-played moment from the convention. His is an important pitch: support from young people like Cawthorn is currently lacking for President Trump. A poll from the Harvard Kennedy School in April showed 18- to 29-year-olds supporting Democratic candidate Joe Biden by a margin of 23 points. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pent-up demand 'leading to quicker home sales'Property deals are racing though compared to last year, as the market recovers after the lockdown freeze.BusinessFlu vaccination rates prompt complacency warningExperts fear the winter flu season could coincide with a rise in Covid-19 infections.UK","Pent-up demand has led to properties taking less time to sell since the height of lockdown, according to research. In the 90 days to mid-August, a three-bedroom home has typically sold in 24 days, property portal Zoopla said. This is 12 days quicker than the same period a year ago. All types of property have been selling faster, its research suggested. People have been reconsidering what they want from a home. One-bedroom flats are now taking the longest to sell at 34 days, although they are also selling much faster than historical norms. The number of property sales in the UK remains low this year owing to the halt put on the housing market at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak. However, there has been a mini-boom since the market reopened in different parts of the UK. Sales agreed on the portal were 76% higher than the five-year average, Zoopla said. ""Buyer appetite has been widely attributed to pent-up demand resulting from lockdown, but it also reflects the impact on the nation as it collectively reassesses what it wants and needs from a home,"" its report said.

Flu vaccination rates prompt complacency warningExperts fear the winter flu season could coincide with a rise in Covid-19 infections.UK,"Flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable have been falling in the UK Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, experts warn, as data reveals the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme. Last month, the governmentannounced plans to doublethe number of people who receive the influenza jab. But BBC analysis has found the take-up rate among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declined. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not want a flu outbreak ""at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". The government wants to increase the number of people vaccinated from 15 million to 30 million amid fears coronavirus cases will rise again in the autumn. Local authorities in England saw an average 45% of people with serious health conditions under 65 take up the offer of a free vaccine last winter, data shows. That represents a drop from 50% in 2015. The UK government has an ambition to vaccinate 55% of people in vulnerable groups, which includes people with multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes or chronic asthma. The World Health Organization,external(WHO) has previously said countries should vaccinate 75% of people in ""vulnerable"" categories. Public Health England,externalsays the jab -  which in recent years has been freely available to over 65s, those with long running health conditions and pregnant women, among others - is the most effective way to reduce pressures on intensive care units. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government was expanding its flu vaccination programme this year because ""we don't want a flu outbreak at the same time as dealing with coronavirus"". ""We have bought more flu vaccine than ever before,"" he said. ""In fact we have changed the law so that more people can administer the jab. We want pharmacists, nurses and GPs to be able to administer the jab."" Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson suffers from the long-term effects of Covid-19 The prospect of a surge in flu cases over winter is also of concern to many people still suffering from what has been dubbed ""long Covid"". That is where coronavirus patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue and breathlessness long after two weeks. Jeanne Jarvis-Gibson, a digital culture and communications student at the University of Liverpool, is one of many long-term Covid sufferers to join a growing online community. The 27-year-old, from Washington in the United States, used to be a keen runner - but now has to take a steroid inhaler and struggles to walk up stairs at her university halls. She said: ""I think getting the flu vaccine is vital now more than ever with the possible co-mingling of Covid and flu. ""I would think about it in the same way as wearing a mask when you go out. It's about mutual respect for people. ""It's more than just your own health - we have to think about everyone in our society."" Dr Tonia Thomas, project manager at the Vaccine Knowledge Trust, which is part of the University of Oxford, said: ""People think the flu is not that bad, that is even for people who are in the risk groups. ""They are leading healthy lives in terms of day-to-day living. I have spoken to patients who say they forgot they are in a risk group. ""It is only when they contract an infection that they realise their body responds differently to other people's."" The uptake rate among over-65s has remained consistent in recent years, however. Last winter, 73% took up the offer. By BBC Health Correspondent Smitha Mundasad Health officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine gets one this year - with around 30 million people being offered them in the UK's largest ever flu immunisation programme. But how will it work? And will things be worse this year? Continue reading here. Flu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during this year - as a big flu season combined with a fresh surge of coronavirus cases could overwhelm hospitals. Between September 2019 and February this year, almost 8,000 people died from flu in England alone. But the number has varied. In 2017 and 2018, more than 22,000 people died from the virus. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters During the 2019-20 flu season, 3.16 million people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition were vaccinated, 130,000 more than there were five years before. But taking into account factors such as population growth, the proportion of vulnerable people receiving the jab has fallen. Figures from the last winter flu season show local authorities in England averaged just 45%. In Scotland it was 43%, Northern Ireland 52% and Wales 44%. London and the east of England are suffering from particularly low uptake rates among vulnerable patients and in schools. Only 29% of people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition took up the jab in Hammersmith and Fulham last winter. While the government is aiming for a ""universal"" uptake of the flu vaccine among health workers, it has also remained historically low in some parts of the NHS and, in particular, mental health care providers. At West London NHS Trust, which looks after mental health patients in Hammersmith and Ealing, some 1,471 of its 2,880 front-line staff took the jab last winter. ""Our current position remains unacceptably low,"" said Stephanie Bridger, director of nursing and patient experience. ""This year - in the context of Covid-19 - we are redoubling our efforts to promote the critical importance of having the flu vaccination as early as possible."" Professor Heidi Larson says ""apathy"" is the main barrier Prof Heidi Larson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world-leading expert on attitudes towards immunisation and a director of the International Vaccine Confidence Project. While many fear the jab or nasal spray can cause illness, she believes most underestimate the severity of flu. ""I find there is almost a complacency around the vaccine in the UK,"" she said. ""It doesn't have the same aggressive 'anti' sentiment we see against some of the childhood vaccines."" Early surveys carried out by the Vaccine Confidence Project show that, in Europe, there is growing support for the flu vaccine as people are concerned about a second Covid-19 wave. However, Prof Larson said many did not take the vaccine for legitimate reasons, particularly as the nasal spray given to children contains porcine gelatine. It is not suitable for vegetarians and, last year, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was not permitted in Islam except under exceptional health circumstances. ""There are also people that say it doesn't work enough, it's not effective enough,"" Prof Larson added. ""Some years it really isn't that effective against all strains. ""But I would certainly urge people to take it anyway as you wouldn't want the strains that it does protect against. ""It's also so important to limit the stress on the system. ""Two or three years ago the Red Cross had to come in to handle a bad flu season on its own."" Prof Wendy Barclay says health bosses have failed to make an effective case Previous government flu campaigns have also failed to address the ""myth"" that the vaccine can cause illness, according to leading virologist Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious diseases at Imperial College London. She believes this puts many parents off allowing their children to take the nasal spray. In the capital, only 50% of eligible schoolchildren had the free vaccine last winter. Prof Barclay said: ""My issue with Public Health England is if they don't make the message strong enough - so parents think: 'It's only the flu, my kids will be fine'."" Meanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year,74% of staff,externalwere immunised. Paulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: ""It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the UK had some of the best flu vaccine uptake rates across Europe. She said: ""Flu vaccine uptake rates in Europe and the flu vaccination programme will be supported with a major new public facing marketing campaign to encourage take up amongst eligible groups for the free flu vaccine. ""With Covid-19 still likely to be circulating during flu season, it is more important than ever to have the flu vaccination and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer of vaccination to help relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives.""

"Chief civil servant sacked after exams rowThe Department for Education's permanent secretary will leave as the PM calls for ""fresh leadership"".UK PoliticsGirls Aloud's Harding diagnosed with breast cancerThe 38-year-old star says she is doing her best to stay positive after the ""devastating"" diagnosis.Entertainment & Arts","The chief civil servant at the Department for Education has been sacked following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. A government statement said Boris Johnson ""concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". But the civil service union accused No 10 of ""discarding"" its members to ""keep scrutiny from the government's door"". Mr Slater is thefifth permanent secretary to leave his post in six months. The news comes a day after the head of exam regulator Ofqual, Sally Collier, also resigned from her role. Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam fiasco Ofqual chief steps down after exams chaos Why have there been so many U-turns? Thousands of A-level studentssaw their results downgraded earlier this monthdue to an algorithm designed to moderate them. It led to a huge backlash and a u-turn by government ahead of the publication of GCSE results, reverting the grades back to those awarded by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faced calls to resign, but No 10 said it had full confidence in him. Mr Slater has been the permanent secretary at the DfE for four years and was due to step down in Spring 2021. He will now be replaced by Susan Acland-Hood, who was brought into the department on a temporary contract last weekto lead on its exam response. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill thanked Mr Slater for his 35 years as a public servant and the government said a permanent replacement would be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mr Williamson also thanked Mr Slater for his ""commitment to public service"", adding: ""Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time."" The education secretary said he and his new permanent secretary's ""immediate focus remains on making sure every child returns to the classroom full-time at the start of term"". The general secretary of the FDA union, Dave Penman, criticised the decision to sack Mr Slater. He said: ""If it wasn't clear before, then it certainly is now - this administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment's hesitation to shield ministers from any kind of accountability."" He accused the government of ""scapegoating"" civil servants and claimed trust between ministers and civil servants was ""at an all-time low"". The Labour Party also condemned the move, saying civil servants had ""time and time again taken the fall for the incompetence and failures of ministers"". Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. ""Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable, qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack."" Former head of the Home Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, who has worked as a Labour advisor, called the sacking ""a disgrace"", telling Times Radio that senior civil servants were ""carrying the can for the failure of ministers"". So, what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy. And now, both a senior civil servant and the head of Ofqual have now departed, while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is now emerging. In February, the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court, claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss, but have nonetheless left their jobs. The most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved, the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure, and it was confirmed last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving too. So, not-so-permanent secretaries seems to be a feature of this administration. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service. In a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is they might be sacrificed for short-term news management, rather than as the result of any strategic master plan. And there is a risk that this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles in the future.

She made it to the final and was voted into the group which became Girls Aloud, alongside Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl Tweedy. Girls Aloud L-R: Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Tweedy and Nadine Coyle The group went on to have several UK hits, including Sound of the Underground, The Promise, Love Machine, Jump and Call The Shots. Girls Aloud reunited in 2012 after a short hiatus, to release and tour a greatest hits album. They announced their split in 2013. Harding has since taken on several acting roles, including appearances in Run for Your Wife, and St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold. She appeared on the Channel 4 reality show The Jump in 2016, but was forced to pull out after suffering a knee injury. In 2017, she won Celebrity Big Brother. The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under 40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

Trump challenges Biden to drug test before debateThe president claims Mr Biden went from incoherent to articulate in a previous debate.US Election 2020,"Mr Trump and Mr Biden will have three live TV debates US President Donald Trump has called for himself and Democratic challenger Joe Biden to submit to drug tests before their first debate next month. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner he had noticed a sudden improvement in Mr Biden's performance in the Democratic TV debates. The president offered no evidence his rival might be on drugs other than to say: ""I'm pretty good at this stuff."" Mr Biden and Mr Trump will have three debates before the 3 November election. Back in 2016, Mr Trump suggested his then-Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had been ""getting pumped up"" before their debates and challenged her to take a drug test ahead of their final live TV encounter. The Clinton camp brushed aside his challenge. On Wednesday, the president - who is set to deliver his keynote address to the ongoing Republican party convention on Thursday - made a similar claim, arguing that Mr Biden's debating ability had improved markedly in the final debate. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... Mr Trump said the former US vice-president ""wasn't even coherent"" during some of the 11 live TV debates he competed in against a crowded field of contenders during the Democratic primary season. By the time of the last debate on 15 March, the field had been whittled down to just Mr Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr Trump told the Washington Examiner,external: ""I don't know how he [Mr Biden] could have been so incompetent in his debate performances and then all of a sudden be OK against Bernie."" This video can not be played Joe Biden earlier this month: 'Why the hell would I take a cognitive test?' He added: ""It wasn't that he was Winston Churchill because he wasn't, but it was a normal, boring debate. ""You know, nothing amazing happened. And we are going to call for a drug test because there's no way - you can't do that."" Mr Trump said of the debates: ""Well, it is a prizefight. It's no different from the gladiators, except we have to use our brain and our mouth. And our body to stand. I want all standing - they want to sit down."" The three presidential debates will take place in Cleveland, Ohio, on 29 September; in Miami, Florida, on 15 October; and Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 October. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Trump asked for extra debates to be scheduled with Mr Biden, but the Commission on Presidential Debates declined.

More reinforcements sent to quell Wisconsin unrest,"This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest More reinforcements are being sent to the US city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, following unrest sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police on Sunday as he leaned into his car and as his children watched. Protests since then have turned violent, with two people killed and one injured on Tuesday night. A 17-year-old youth has been arrested. Mr Blake is recovering in hospital and is conscious, his family say. But his lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting? Three facts that help explain anger in the US 'Black people have been through a lot this year' The protests over Mr Blake's shooting have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. Hours after Mr Blake was shot on Sunday, hundreds rallied outside Kenosha's police headquarters. As the protests went on, cars were set alight, armed robberies were reported and a night-time curfew was eventually put in place. Protesters said police and troops used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city again. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. On social media, footage showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire at them. Other videos show armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. At a news conference on Wednesday, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis confirmed that a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, had been arrested over the deaths of a 26- and 36-year-old during Tuesday's protests. The injured individual is also 26 years of age, and is expected to recover, he said. The teenager, named as Kyle Rittenhouse, has been held on suspicion of first-degree murder. Sheriff David Beth said that there had been calls for him to allow civilians to help with law enforcement - a process known as deputising. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' ""What happened last night was probably the perfect reason why I wouldn't,"" he said. The sheriff added that he was not certain but believed the individual involved in the two deaths belonged to a group that wanted to be deputised. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was sending ""federal law enforcement and the National Guard"" to Kenosha. ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he tweeted. Shortly following Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Evers, the Wisconsin governor, said he had authorised 500 National Guard troops to support law enforcement efforts.

Mayor Antaramian told reporters on Wednesday: ""I am here today basically to, number one, inform everyone that we are not planning on letting this violence continue. ""Number two, we are going to work together to resolve the racial issues in our community, and we are going to make that work."" A new curfew is to be implemented from 19:00-07:00 and last until Sunday. On Tuesday, Mr Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, said that her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but that if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Her sister said she was numb with pain. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said was ""sick"" that a black man had been shot by police once again. ""Justice must be done,"" Mr Biden said.

Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. On Wednesday night, the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team became the first to boycott a match in response to Mr Blake's shooting. They did not appear for game five of their NBA play-off series against the Orlando Magic. Prior to the game, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said: ""Myself, my players and our organisation are very disturbed by what happened in Kenosha."" He added: ""It is a great challenge to have an appreciation and a desire to want change, to want something different and better in Kenosha, Milwaukee and Wisconsin, and then to go out and play a game."" Bucks boycott NBA game after shooting Afterwards, the NBA announced the two remaining games scheduled for Wednesday had also been postponed. The Toronto Raptors, who won last year's NBA championship, were reportedly discussing boycotting an upcoming conference semi-final game as well. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that's not getting the job done."" What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting?
