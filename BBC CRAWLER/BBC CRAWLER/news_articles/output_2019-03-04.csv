Grayling under fire for Commons ferry absence,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has been accused by MPs of evading scrutiny over his department's Â£33m Brexit payout to Eurotunnel, after another minister took his place in the Commons. Health Secretary Matt Hancock responded to questions about Friday's settlement. He defended his appearance, saying the out-of-court payment had secured the ""unhindered"" supply of medicines if there was no Brexit deal this month. But Labour said Mr Grayling had become an ""international embarrassment"". Its transport spokesman, Andy McDonald, said the cabinet minister had shown his ""disregard for taxpayers"" by his absence and must be sacked immediately. Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case Live: MPs discuss Stronger Towns fund Ferry case adds to list of Grayling mishaps ""Once again the transport secretary is not in his place to answer a question directed at him,"" he said. ""Even in this golden age of ministerial incompetence, the transport secretary stands out from the crowd. ""He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, causing chaos and wasting billions of pounds yet he shows no contrition, no acknowledgement of his mistakes nor any resolve to learn and improve. ""The transport secretary has become an international embarrassment."" Asked where Mr Grayling was, Mr Hancock said he was busy seeking to improve the UK's transport network. The health secretary challenged the opposition to say they would not have sanctioned the settlement if they had known, without it, vital medicines might not be available. Mr Grayling has been under political pressure for a series of transport policy mishaps, leading his opponents to dub him ""failing Grayling"". In December, the Department for Transport contracted three suppliers to provide additional freight capacity on ferries for lorries but Eurotunnel said the contracts had been handed out in a ""secretive"" way. One of the companies awarded a ferry contract, Seaborne Freight, has already had its deal cancelled after the Irish company backing it pulled out. This followedBBC news finding out that Seaborne had no shipsand had never run a ferry service.

Trudeau crisis grows as minister resigns,"Liberal MP Jane Philpott (L) has resigned from PM Justin Trudeau's cabinet One of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's top ministers has quit saying she has lost confidence in the government's handling of a corruption inquiry. Treasury Board President Jane Philpott said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations."" Mr Trudeau said he was disappointed by the resignation, but understood it. He has denied political meddling to shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial. Opposition Conservatives last week called on the Liberal PM to resign. A number of opinion polls indicate Mr Trudeau's popularity is slipping in the run-up to a general election scheduled for October. The cabinet minister announced her decision to step down on Monday, posting her resignation letter detailing her ""serious concerns"" with ""evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin"". This video can not be played Mr Trudeau was heckled at various points as he gave an address, though it is unclear why ""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,"" she said in a statement. Her letter said it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue to serve in the cabinet. ""It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,"" she wrote. ""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised."" The former family physician has held key portfolios in Mr Trudeau's cabinet - health, indigenous services and, until this week, treasury board president - since being elected in 2015. She will remain on as a Liberal member of Parliament. In a short statement, Mr Trudeau thanked Ms Philpott for ""her years of service and her dedication to Canadians"". And commenting on the growing political scandal at a rally in Toronto later, the prime minister said: ""Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am."" Three ways this story is a problem for Trudeau Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies. The firm and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in connection with about C$48m ($36m; Â£28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways. SNC-Lavalin says it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoing of former executives. The matter is proceeding to trial and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations. A conviction could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on Canadian federal contracts, which would be a major financial blow to the firm. A deepening crisis for Trudeau - what it means This is the third high-profile resignation following accusations Mr Trudeau and some of his top aides tried to shield SNC-Lavalin from a corruption trial. Former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet in February. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide, Gerald Butts, announced he would quit, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff had done anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the team's ""vital work"". He is expected to speak on Wednesday before the House of Commons Justice Committee, which is looking into the matter. Ms Wilson-Raybould has said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" late last year to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures. The Liberal government brought in the remediation agreement regime in 2018 as part of a massive budget bill following lobbying efforts by the company. Ms Wilson-Raybould says she resisted that pressure and believes she was shuffled out of the justice portfolio as a consequence. Mr Trudeau has maintained that any discussions he had with Ms Wilson-Raybould were lawful and appropriate and that his government was concerned that thousands of jobs were at stake if the company went to trial.

Macron calls for reforms to protect EU,"Emmanuel Macron has published an open letter to Europe in newspapers across the continent French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a series of reforms to ensure the future of the European Union. In an opinion piece published in newspapers across Europe,he calls for the creation of an agency to protect the bloc against cyber-attacks,external. Ahead of May's European elections, he advocates a ban on foreign powers financing European political parties. And he suggests the British people were not properly informed before voting to leave the EU. Mr Macron set out his proposals for a ""European renaissance"" in an open letter addressed directly to the ""citizens of Europe"", which was published in newspapers in all 28 EU member states. Macron urges EU to shun nationalism Macron pushes for 'true European army' In his letter, Mr Macron says the EU as an institution needs a major shake-up if it is to stop member states ""retreating into nationalism"" - a direct reference to Brexit. ""Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future?"" he asks, using the UK's withdrawal from the union as an example of the EU being in crisis. ""Who spoke to them about losing access to the EU market? Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the border?"" He describes the EU as ""not just an economic market"" but a ""project"", before going on to set out his ""roadmap for the EU"". In his open letter to Europe, Mr Macron proposes the creation of several new bodies that would oversee change within the EU. They are: European Agency for the Protection of Democracies, to protect against cyber attacks, the spread of fake news, and to ban foreign powers from funding European political parties European Council for Internal Security, which would comprise a Europe-wide border force agency and asylum office, and a European security council that would have ""the UK on board"" An EU minimum wage, which would be ""appropriate to each country"" and negotiated collectively on an annual basis, and a guarantee that EU citizens would get ""the same pay for the same work"" European Climate Bank, which would finance the EU's transition to his suggested environmental targets, ""zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025"" A European food safety force, to ""improve our food controls"" and protect them from the ""lobby threat"" with ""independent scientific assessment of substances hazardous to the environment and health"" A Conference for Europe, which Mr Macron wants the EU to set up by the end of this year, so that changes can be proposed and approved by representatives from EU institutions and member states By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris For months President Macron has been forced to concentrate on home affairs, thanks to the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) movement. But that crisis is waning. So now, with EU elections approaching in May, is the moment to fire an opening salvo in that campaign, and return to his big theme of European renewal. We have been here before. Before his election he campaigned under a blue European flag, and in his Sorbonne speech of September 2017 he promised a new era of Franco-German unity at the heart of an invigorated EU. The results have been, to say the least, disappointing. Now he is back with more of the vision thing, but this time observers detect a shift. Today the focus seems to be more on protection, defence and borders - rather than economic and social convergence; and more on intergovernmental cooperation, rather than federalism.  A nod perhaps to the power of his foes, and their ""populist"" rationale. First, Mr Macron says a new European Agency for the Protection of Democracies should be set up to provide each member state with experts who can protect their election processes from cyber-attacks, and manipulation from foreign powers. ""Our first freedom is democratic freedom,"" he writes. ""The freedom to chose our leaders as foreign powers seek to influence our votes at every election."" He then adds that ""we should also ban the funding of European political parties by foreign powers"". Hackers 'intercept EU diplomatic cables' Macronâs marvellous manoeuvres This is seen as a reference both toclaims of Russian links to elements of the Brexit campaign, and to the controversy overRussian financing of the far-right French political party, National Front. As well as this, the French president says, the EU should bring in rules ""banishing incitement to hatred and violence from the internet"". He also says the EU should write up a new treaty of defence and security, and set up a European security council, which would include the UK. In 2017, France said it had beentargeted by 24,000 cyber-attacks in a year- and warned that it could be hit by a campaign like the one thought to have targeted the 2016 US election. And the European Innovation Council, which already exists, should be given a larger budget ""on a par with the United States"" in order to support research into new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Using Brexit as an example, Mr Macron warns against letting EU member states ""retreat into nationalism"" Mr Macron then goes on to say that those who want to belong to the visa-free Schengen area should accept both stricter controls on outer borders, and a common asylum policy for migrants. At the moment, different Schengen member states are able to have wildly different policies on asylum and immigration. Germany, for instance, accepted about 1.2 million asylum seekers during the 2015-16 crisis, while Hungarypassed a law criminalising lawyers and activists who helped asylum seekers. ""We will need a common border force and a European asylum office, strict control obligations and European solidarity to which each country will contribute under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security,"" he writes. The French president then suggests bringing in new social security measures for EU citizens, including a new ""EU minimum wage"" that would be ""appropriate to each country, negotiated collectively every year"". He also says that the EU should have a ""social shield"" that would guarantee that workers doing the same job get the same pay. ""[Europe] needs to drive forward a project of convergence rather than competition,"" he adds. Mr Macron also proposes new EU-wide environmental targets - ""zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025"" - which would be financed by a new European Climate Bank. A new ""European food safety force"" would enforce the EU's food controls, while funding independent scientific research to combat the influence of corporate lobbies. ""We can't let nationalists with no solutions exploit people's anger,"" he concludes. ""We can't sleepwalk to a diminished Europe... European humanism demands action.""

Ten charts on knife crime,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

How Scotland tackled knife crime,"The number of murders in Scotland has more than halved over the last decade Home Secretary Sajid Javidhas condemned the ""senseless violence""that has seen a rise in the number of teenagers being stabbed to death across the UK. In London, a Violence Reduction Unit is now up and running in a bid to tackle the number of teenagers dying as a result of knife crime. It is based on a ground-breaking approach used in Scotland. Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) was set up to stem the tide of knife crime which saw Glasgow become Europe's murder capital. From its formation in 2005 the VRU proposed a fresh approach to tackling the problem. Its key message was that gang-related stabbings and slashings were not just a policing issue but a public health issue. The unit's motto was a simple one: ""Violence is preventable, not inevitable."" In 2004/05 there were 137 homicides (which include murder and culpable homicide figures) in Scotland -  in Glasgow, there were 40 cases alone, double the national rate. By 2016/17 the number had more than halved to 62. Last year this had reduced by a further three to 59. A sharp instrument was the main method of killing for 34 (58%) of those cases and all but one of them involved a knife. This homicide figure was the joint lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976. Over the years the VRU has worked closely with partners in the NHS, education and social work. It has stressed the importance of positive role models and its projects have been shaped by statistics. Home secretary: 'Knife crime can't go on' Can knife crime be stopped before it starts Knife crime deaths at highest level since WW2 London violent crime 'a public health issue' Former director John Carnochan once showed me a jagged graph of violent crime in Glasgow. It included many spikes but at one point it plummeted dramatically. Mr Carnochan explained: ""That was Valentine's Day."" Love may virtually halt violence once a year but other factors have helped Glasgow shed its unwanted reputation as No Mean City. BBC Scotland looks at five key aspects of the VRU's work. Singer Frankie Vaughan addresses gang members in Easterhouse Glasgow's gang culture was highlighted in the 1960s when singer Frankie Vaughan visited Easterhouse to speak to young people. He famously convinced rival leaders to shake hands and give up their weapons. Fast forward four decades and the then Strathclyde Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen House invited teenagers from some of the most deprived areas of the city to Glasgow Sheriff Court. The symbolism was powerful as Sir Stephen urged them to renounce violence or risk returning to the court for real. The VRU made bold statements to young people in simple, no nonsense terms. For example, chalk outlines of a body and a knife once appeared in 15 areas identified as gang trouble spots. Officers also proactively visited suspected gang members, targeted their meeting places and monitored their activity on early social networking sites, such as Bebo. The notorious MS-13 street gang was formed in LA by immigrants from El Salvador The VRU sought inspiration from across the Atlantic in its bid to make Glasgow's streets safer. Within two years of implementing Operation Ceasefire in 1995, Boston had reduced violent crime by about 50%. In 2009 the VRU launched the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV). It was designed to offer young people an alterative to gang membership, such as youth clubs, as well as the prospect of training and work. Former offenders were drafted in to share their experiences with the next generation. In 2011 police said the CIRV had resulted in a50% reduction in violent offendingby those taking part. Even among gang members who refused to participate, data indicated a 25% fall in the number of offences committed. Callum, from the east end of Glasgow, has been stabbed multiple times In 2008 six surgeons who had witnessed first-hand the devastating impact of knife crime formed Medics Against Violence (MAV). One of its early projects involved sending senior doctors into schools to share their harrowing experiences. MAV also produced a 15-minute film, called Your Choice, and devised lesson plans to help stimulate a debate. The organisation encouraged knife-crime victims to co-operate with the police as research showed many attacks went unreported. It has also informed national debates, such as the case for minimum alcohol pricing. Earlier this year Dr Christine Goodall, of MAV, saidmore than 80% of assault victimsin hospital emergency departments had been drinking, as had the people who had assaulted them. The VRU's holistic approach was illustrated at an anti-violence conference at the Scottish Police College. It included a session by Canadian parenting expert Mary Gordon which highlighted the importance of empathy. Sexting has become a major problem among young people The VRU launched a mentoring project in schools which is designed to combat the emerging threat of cyberbullying and encourage children to stay safe online. Former Chief Insp Graham Goulden, said the scale of the problem should not be underestimated in light of the ""sexually toxic environment"" children are growing up in. The Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) initiative teaches young people leadership skills to help them support their fellow pupils. The scheme, which was devised by US academic Jackson Katz, also coaches young people to challenge offensive behaviour. During workshops, pupils are asked questions such as: ""Is it sometimes ok to send a sexually explicit photo to another person?"" The debates that follow aim to make teenagers think more carefully about their actions and what is acceptable behaviour. Meanwhile, VRU deputy director Will Linden has credited a dramatic reduction in school exclusions in Scotland over the last decade as a key factor in keeping children out of trouble. Offenders must be free from drugs and alcohol to get onto the 12-month training programme aimed at turning their lives around One of the VRU's key objectives is to offer young people an alternative path. In 2010, Brigadier David Allfrey, a former commander of 51 Scottish Brigade in Stirling, ran an adventure and leadership training scheme with former gang members. And two years later he handed five men, aged 18 to 25,a role in the world-renowned Edinburgh Military Tattoo,external. The ex-offenders, from the east end of Glasgow and Kilmarnock's Onthank estate were stationed at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh for the duration of the event. During each performance they moved props around and performed. Brigadier Allfrey, the Tattoo's chief executive and producer, said: ""There is enormous human potential wrapped up in these young men."" The VRU was also influenced by LA-based Homeboy Industries, which offers gang members employment in its cafes. One such example isStreet & Arrow in Glasgow's West End, which launched in 2016. It offers modern street food served from an airstream truck and hires former offenders for 12-month blocks. Workers are paired with a mentor who can help them master everything from basic employment skills, like turning up on time, through to debt management and relationship issues.

Salisbury 'shows' Russia stockpiling weapons,"The Salisbury attack demonstrated that Russia continues to research, manufacture and stockpile chemical weapons, US state department officials have told BBC Newsnight. If true, Russia would be in violation of one of the major post-Cold War arms control treaties. This accusation opens the possibility that the entire system of treaties and inspections designed to prevent the use of such poisons could become defunct. Now the question of further US sanctions - in order to punish this alleged breach of the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention - is causing heated debate within Washington. In September 2017 the international watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsdeclared that Russia had successfully completed the destruction of its arsenal,externalof these toxic agents, and indeed the Kremlin has reminded us of this many times since Salisbury. But Western diplomats and intelligence officials allege that, on the contrary, the attack aimed at Sergei Skripal a year ago has exposed systematic attempts to cheat on the convention as well as deceive the international community. ""The use of an unscheduled nerve agent in Salisbury has made it extraordinarily clear that Russia only eliminated its declared chemical weapons stockpile,"" a US state department official told Newsnight. ""(It) is further evidence that Russia has not declared all its chemical weapons production facilities, its chemical weapons development facilities, and its chemical weapons stockpiles,"" they added. US Skripal sanctions hit Russian rouble The Salisbury poisoning: What happened next? 'I helped create Salisbury nerve agent' What are Novichok nerve agents? The UK says officers from the GRU, Russian military intelligence, smeared a liquid nerve agent on the door handle of Mr Skripal's house in Salisbury. The poison - one of a family developed in the former Soviet Union called Novichok - was, Western officials believe, of relatively recent production, forming part of a hidden or ""undeclared"" stock. Last August, under a 1991 US law, Washingtonbegan taking action against Russiafor Salisbury with restrictions on certain US exports. Moscow was given 90 days to comply with US requests including opening their chemical weapons facilities for inspection, but failed to do so by the November deadline. The Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Elimination Act now obliges the US government to take further measures against Russia - steps that could include everything from bans on oil imports and banking controls, to a complete halt to airline services between the two countries. The US has hesitated to impose such draconian sanctions, because ""we must carefully consider the impact that sanctions will have on US national security interests"", a state department official explained, adding ""since the second round also involves selecting measures from a larger list of possible sanctions, we must also weigh the relative value of each of the sanctions"". The US law though, critically, does not impose a deadline on the Trump administration for the imposition of such sanctions. Inevitably, there are some voices in Washington who do not want a major escalation of such measures against Russia at this time. Some others too do not want to highlight the failure of the Chemical Weapons Convention, feeling it still provides a useful instrument against countries trying to field such poisons.

Giraffe chain owner to close 27 restaurants,"The owner of Giraffe and Ed's Easy Diner is to close 27 restaurants putting hundreds of jobs at risk. The brands will enter a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) and close almost a third of their 87 restaurants. Boparan Restaurant Group (BRG) said sales had improved at the chains since they were acquired in 2016, but several sites remained unprofitable. Tom Crowley, chief executive of BRG, said: ""The CVA is the only option to protect the company."" He added: ""The combination of increasing costs and over-supply of restaurants in the sector and a softening of consumer demand have all contributed to the challenges both these brands face."" The proposal to enter a CVA will be put to a creditor vote, with advisers from KPMG overseeing the insolvency process. Restaurant insolvencies jump by 25% Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? BRG snapped up Giraffe from Tesco in 2016, before combining it with Ed's Easy Diner, which it had bought in a pre-pack administration the same year. The two brands form a combined entity, which in the most recently available accounts had annual turnover of Â£67.1m with underlying losses of Â£1.6m. The company owns 70 branches of the two chains, with 17 franchised restaurants unaffected by the CVA. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, said: ""This CVA seeks to address the cost of the company's leasehold obligations across a number of unprofitable sites, and if successful, will put the business on a surer financial footing."" Creditors will vote on the proposal on 21 March with at least 75% needed to approve it for the CVA to proceed. BRG also owns other brands, which are not involved in this CVA. These include fish and chip restaurant Harry Ramsden and the upmarket Cinnamon Collection. It is also the master franchisee for US brand Slim Chickens, which first opened in the UK last year. BRG is owned by ""chicken king"" Ranjit Boparan, who also owns the 2 Sister group, which supplies food to supermarkets such as Aldi, Asda, Co-op, KFC, Lidl, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Last year, rising costs and tougher competition led to several restaurant brands shutting branches, including Prezzo, Jamie's Italian, Byron, Carluccio's, Gaucho and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.

Police 'not told' of 1980s MP abuse claim,"Peter Morrison was the Tory MP for Chester until 1992 Claims of an MP's ""penchant for small boys"" were passed to security services but they did not investigate or report them to police, an inquiry has heard. A 1986 letter implicated the late Tory MP for Chester, Peter Morrison, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard. The inquiry is examining how various institutions responded to abuse claims, some made against prominent people. Its latest stage is considering whether political parties ""turned a blind eye"". Brian Altman, lead counsel for the inquiry, said some allegations had already been shown to be false. Despite this, it was ""both necessary and appropriate for this inquiry to investigate"" the role of Westminster during the three-week hearing, he said. Mr Altman said the inquiry would examine whether there were any attempted cover-ups. How does the inquiry work? The hearing on Monday revealed details of a 1986 letter by Sir Antony Duff, who was director-general of the security service at the time. Mr Altman said the letter reported information from a member of the Westminster establishment that Mr Morrison had a ""penchant for small boys"". The informant had heard the allegations from two sources and passed the information to the security service. Further documents obtained by the inquiry from the Cabinet Office and the security service refer to this correspondence. ""Those documents make it clear that neither the security service nor the Cabinet Office took steps to investigate this allegation, nor did they report them to the police,"" Mr Altman said. As part of its investigation, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) will examine the role of partywhips,external- who help organise party business and have the role of persuading MPs and peers to vote along party lines. It will investigate whether any whips became aware of allegations and  ""tried to turn such allegations to their advantage"" to keep party colleagues in line. Mr Altman said they will look at ""whether it is true that the Whips' offices of any party failed to report or, worse, assisted in suppressing allegations or evidence of child sexual abuse"". It will also look at whether the ""Westminster establishment sought to influence policing or prosecutors' decisions"". There will be evidence on ""whether there was a culture whereby people of public prominence were shielded from investigation and their wrongdoing tolerated at the expense of their victims"", added Mr Altman. The way political parties, ""in particular the leadership of these parties"", reacted to allegations of abuse made against their members will also be looked at. The case of Mr Morrison is one of the three case studies. Another one will examine how the Liberal Party (now known as the Liberal Democrats) responded to allegations made against late MP Cyril Smith. The third, most recent, case study will look at Green Party member David Challenor. He was jailed for 22 years last year after being convicted of sexual assault against a 10-year-old girl, the hearing was told. He was allowed to remain an active member of the party while he awaited trial, Mr Altman said. Professor Alexis Jay is chairing the inquiry They are ""extremely serious issues"", he added, telling the inquiry in central London: ""The gravity of these issues in this investigation, we suggest, lies in the fact that they related directly to the alleged conduct of elected representatives."" He said a question by Labour's Tom Watson in the House of Commons in 2012, in which he said there was ""clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10"", could be seen as the ""catalyst for the establishment of this inquiry"". While there have been critics opposed to the work of the inquiry, Mr Altman said it aims to address ""outstanding issues of public concern"". The most serious allegations, from a man called Carl Beech - known by the pseudonym Nick at the time he made the claims to protect his identity - are not being considered by the inquiry. Mr Beech is due to go on trial later this year, accused of fraud and perverting the course of justice. He denies the charges. The Westminster part of the inquiry is set to last for three weeks. It is one of 13 strands being considered by the IICSA, which was set up in 2015 amid allegations a paedophile ring once operated in Westminster. Professor Alexis Jay is chairing the inquiry, which covers England and Wales. Witnesses this month are set to include representatives of MI5, the Metropolitan Police and the Independent Office for Police Conduct. As part of his opening statement, Mr Altman listed a string of allegations against MPs - without concluding whether they were true or false. Before the hearing began, the son of the late Labour peer Lord Janner -who died before allegations of child sexual abuse made against him could be tried- accused the inquiry of being a ""witch hunt against dead politicians"". Daniel Janner, speaking outside the inquiry's headquarters, said it would ""unjustly trash"" the reputations of people like his father as well as Sir Edward Heath and Lord Brittan, adding they ""cannot answer back from the grave"". He described it as a ""massive, out-of-control waste of money"" which was ""contrary to the basic principles of British justice"". Allegations involving Lord Janner are to be dealt with during a separate strand of the inquiry. The inquiry says its Westminster investigation will cover: allegations of child sexual abuse committed by persons of public prominence associated with Westminster and how these came to light the findings of relevant investigations whether there is evidence of conspiracy, cover-up, interference or tolerance in relation to child sexual abuse committed by persons of public prominence associated with Westminster whether governmental, political and law enforcement institutions were aware and took appropriate steps whether there are adequate safeguarding and child protection policies in place within political parties, government departments and agencies One area of inquiry will be the activities of the Paedophile Information Exchange, a campaign group which pushed for sex with children to be legal. There are allegations it had access to Home Office funding.

Funeral crowds cheer World Cup winner Banks,"This video can not be played Goalkeepers Jack Butland, Joe Anyon, Kasper Schmeichel and Joe Hart acted as pallbearers World Cup final teammates of England goalkeeper Gordon Banks have attended his funeral, including hat-trick hero Sir Geoff Hurst whose eulogy described him as a ""superstar"". Hundreds of people lined the streets of Stoke-on-Trent as a cortege made its way around the city. The coffin was also driven to the home of Banks's former club Stoke City where hundreds more chanted and applauded. Jack and Sir Bobby Charlton were among mourners at a later church service. The brothers - who won the World Cup with Banks in 1966 - attended Stoke Minster where Wembley teammate Hurst paid tribute. Hurst said it was a ""very sad day"", describing his former teammate as the ""greatest goalkeeper we've had"". Applause greeted the arrival of the funeral cortege at Stoke City's bet365 Stadium The funeral started with a rendition of Abide with Me - a hymn synonymous with the FA Cup final. Monday's service was held on the 47th anniversary of Stoke City's 1972 League Cup final victory over Chelsea in which Banks played a leading role. Before the funeral, members of the public stood five or six-deep on pavements around Stoke-on-Trent, with people inside the bet365 Stadium chanting ""England's number one"" as Banks's achievements were displayed on a big screen. His coffin was carried by goalkeepers from his three ex-clubs, Stoke, Leicester City and Chesterfield. The pallbearers were Stoke and England goalkeeper Jack Butland; Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel; Chesterfield keeper Joe Anyon; and England and Burnley's Joe Hart. The service ended with a recording of the song My Way performed by Frank Sinatra. Veteran former goalkeepers (left to right) Pat Jennings, Ray Clemence and David Seaman were at the service Banks, who died on 12 February aged 81, started his career at Chesterfield before joining Leicester City in 1959 for Â£7,000. At Leicester, he established himself as England's number one, earning his first international cap in 1963 against Scotland. In eight years at Leicester, he was runner-up in two FA Cup finals and won the League Cup in 1964, before joining Stoke in 1967. Peter Shilton was at Leicester City at the same time as Banks, eventually taking over from him He stayed at the Potters until his retirement from professional football, winning the League Cup again in 1972, the club's only major honour. Fifa named him goalkeeper of the year six times and he earned 73 caps for England. He played in every game of the 1966 World Cup campaign, culminating in the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final at Wembley. Banks obituary - The career of a legend Daughter 'very proud' ahead of funeral Live updates from the funeral Hurst delivered a eulogy, describing Banks as ""a superstar on the field, [but] off the field he was an ordinary guy with no airs or graces"". He added: ""He was a joker, a funny man, for over 50 years, and every time we met during our careers or years after he would come up and joke."" Stoke City chairman Peter Coates told mourners: ""We regard him as our adopted, famous son.

Brexit Britain will be 'lost in space'One of the UK's most successful space entrepreneurs says Brexit will do immense harm to industry.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Planet satellites launch from the space station: The firm has some 150 operational spacecraft One of the UK's most successful space entrepreneurs has launched a withering attack on Brexit, labelling it ""galactic scale stupidity"". Will Marshall'sPlanet company,externaloperates the world's largest satellite imaging network, with 150 spacecraft able to fully picture Earth on a daily basis. He warns EU withdrawal will do immense harm to Britain's space industry. The UK will be ""lost in space"", he says. The UK Space Agency responded by saying home businesses had a positive outlook. The most recent survey of confidence across the sector found that three-quarters of organisations expected growth over the next three years, it added. Dr Marshall, a Nasa employee before founding Planet, airs his concernsin a blog posting,external. ""Post Brexit, no CEO would locate a space company [in the UK],"" he argues. ""Why put your European base outside the single market of the largest trading block in the world?! Or likely without access to the main government programmes? Company after company will avoid it,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Satellites show extent of volcano collapse Money released for 'UK sat-nav' study OneWeb launches pathfinder satellites Dr Marshall says the idea of a UK sat-nav system is ""pie in the sky"" Dr Marshall holds particular scorn for the UK government's actions on Galileo, the EU version of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Ministers have decided to walk away from the project because Brussels says a future Britain, as a ""third country"" outside the EU, cannot be involved in the system's most secure elements - this despite the UK having already invested Â£1.5bn in Galileo. London says it will build its own sat-nav system instead, but Dr Marshall calls this a ""pie in the sky"" plan that has significant economic and security implications. ""The costs would dwarf the entire UK space budget,"" he writes, and all for a redundant system that is ""likely years behind and second tier to that of its close allies!"" Planet's view of Brussels: The EU is an ever more dominant force in European space activity Dr Marshall's enterprise is headquartered in California, with a European base in Germany. Founded along with Robbie Schingler and Chris Boshuizen in 2010 - Planet has led a revolution in Earth observation that's based on the use of low-cost, shoe-box-sized satellites. Europe as a whole is racing to catch up, although the UK - it has to be said - has been better placed than most. Companies like Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd pioneered the use of commercial off-the-shelf components to reduce the cost of spacecraft manufacturing, and Clyde Space of Glasgow is now one of the go-to producers of just the type of satellites used by Planet. But the former Oxford and Leicester physicist worries that his home country is pulling itself out of a space ecosystem in which it has become embedded and on which so much of its capability depends. The UK puts about three-quarters of its civil space budget through the European Space Agency (Esa) and has become a significant player in the EU's growing space activities - not just in Galileo but in Brussels' other big project: the Copernicus/Sentinel Earth observation system. Esa is a separate legal entity to the EU and ministers say Britain will stay in it even as the country leaves the wider union. But Esa and the EU are becoming ever more aligned, with Brussels nowthe single biggest contributor to the agency's budget- â¬1.25bn out of a total of â¬5.72bn per annum. The EU uses Esa as its technical and procurement agent. Many commentators believe the growing influence of Brussels within Esa is leading to tension, and that this unease will only heighten when a big agency member-state like Britain exits the EU. Dr Marshall shares this concern and warns the UK's voice within Esa will become diminished as a result. Sulawesi tsunami aftermath: Planet's satellites picture the entire Earth once a day ""Furthermore, in conversations with senior officials at the UK government during my recent trip there, it became terrifyingly clear that space is an afterthought to the larger political issues of Brexit: there is no plan to mitigate these impacts,"" he writes. A spokesperson for the UK Space Agency (UKSA) said Dr Marshall's pessimism was not shared across industry and pointed tothe recent ""Size and Health"" survey,externalof British space businesses. This found that 73% of organisations expected income to grow over the next three years and 48% of those expected that growth to be more than 10% higher than in the previous three years. ""Space is a truly global endeavour and a key part of the government's modern Industrial Strategy, with over Â£100m committed for new space infrastructure and a further Â£92m to develop options for a UK global satellite navigation system,"" the spokesperson told BBC News. ""We have an excellent track record of working closely with the sector to drive growth, create jobs and collaborate with partners in Europe and the rest of the world. ""This will continue once we leave the EU. We are committed to close international partnerships on space and science programmes, and will remain a leading member of the European Space Agency, which is independent of the EU."" Last week, OneWeb, an international start-up that has chosen to base itself in London, launched the first six satellites in what it hopes will become a near-2,000-spacecraft constellation to deliver internet broadband to every corner of the globe.

"Animals soothed after mascara brush appealA charity which appealed for mascara brushes to groom and comfort baby animals receives hundreds from all over the world.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","This video can not be played The brushes mimics the grooming the baby animals would receive from their parents An Aberdeenshire charity which appealed for mascara brushes to groom and comfort young and injured animals has received hundreds of donations from all over the world. Baby rabbits and pigeons have been among the first to benefit from the scheme at New Arc Animal Rescue Centre, near Ellon. It replaces the grooming they would receive from parents. Mascara brushes have been donated from as far afield as Australia and America. Kevin Newell, who helps care for the animals at the rescue centre, told BBC Scotland of the successful appeal: ""We have been inundated - we have got more wands here than in Hogwarts. ""The mascara brushes are cleaned, and we get them ready for the baby season. They are usually orphaned. ""If using on a small rabbit it's fantastic as they are so fine, it removes mites and dust, and once that grooming process is in place it's a bonding thing. ""It's like parental care. It keeps them clean, happy and healthy."" He added: ""We have given these brushes a second life - and we will then get them recycled and made into another product.""

Stabbed teen 'bright and caring boy',"Officers said they were remaining ""open minded"" about why Yousef Makki was stabbed A teenager phoned home hours before he was fatally stabbed to say he would return for tea, his parents said. Yousef Makki, 17 and from Burnage, was stabbedin Gorse Bank Road, Hale Barns, near Altrincham, on Saturday. His ""devastated"" parents said: ""The next knock at the door [was] officers with the tragic news... it is every parent's worst nightmare."" Manchester Grammar School which he attended described Yousef as a ""dearly loved, incredibly bright pupil"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two boys, also aged 17, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. A spokeswoman said at 18:00 GMT on Monday that officers had been given an extra 24 hours in which to question them. In a statement, Yousef's parents said he was a ""loving and caring son and brother"" and ""loved by everyone"". ""We cannot believe that our son has gone,"" they said. ""Only recently had we talked about his promising life ahead of him and how he was looking forward to life."" His parents appealed for anyone with information to contact the police ""to help us find out what happened on Saturday evening"". Manchester Grammar School said there had been an ""outpouring of grief... at this tragic loss"". Flowers have been placed outside the school where Yousef was studying four A-levels and the school has had two minutes of silence in remembrance of the teenager who hoped to pursue a career in medicine. Neighbour Anne Heffernan said Yousef would always help her with her bags Dr Martin Boulton, high master at Manchester Grammar School, an independent school founded in 1515, said in a statement: ""It is impossible to make sense of such a senseless act, which has taken away a proud family's son, a dear friend and a young man of such promise."" A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for Yousef's funeral has already raised more than Â£14,000. Writing on the GoFundMe page, Kathy Hughes, who taught the teenager at primary school, said she had ""fond memories"" of him and he was a ""bright, caring and considerate boy"". Neighbours have also spoken of their shock at Yousef's death. Anne Heffernan said Yousef was a ""lovely lad"" who would always help her with her bags ""with me being old and a bit disabled"".

Ten charts on the rise of knife crime,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

Bulger father loses killer ID challenge,"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger The father of James Bulger has lost a legal challenge to try to change a lifelong anonymity order for one of his son's killers. Ralph Bulger wanted information about Jon Venables' new identity to be made public, after the murderer wasjailedfor possessing child abuse images. Venables and Robert Thompson, both 10, killed the two-year-old in 1993. Mr Bulger's lawyers argued information about Venables which was ""common knowledge"" should be made public. However, president of the family division Sir Andrew McFarlane refused to change the terms of the order, which was designed to protect the ""uniquely notorious"" Venables from ""being put to death"". Sir Andrew said: ""There is a strong possibility, if not a probability, that if his identity were known he would be pursued resulting in grave and possibly fatal consequences."" James was murdered after he was snatched from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. Under the order, dating back to 2001, Venables and Thompson were granted lifelong anonymity and given new identities when they were released on licence. James Bulger was two when he was snatched and killed in 1993 Mr Bulger, and James' uncle Jimmy, had argued certain details about Venables were easily accessible online. The court was told that included details of the killer's identities, former addresses up to 2017 and prisons where he had been detained. However, under the injunction anyone sharing those details could face prosecution for contempt of court. The Bulgers asked the court to vary the order so it did not cover that information. Sir Andrew rejected their request, saying: ""My decision is in no way a reflection on the applicants themselves, for whom there is a profoundest sympathy. ""The reality is that the case for varying the injunction has simply not been made."" The court order in relation to Venables was changed after he was convicted of offences in 2010 and February last year. He was jailed for three years and four months last year after admitting making indecent images of children and possessing a ""paedophile manual"". James' mother, Denise Fergus,did not support the legal battle. Speaking last year, she said: ""I've always said, I don't want them dead, because I don't want blood on my hands. I don't agree with killing someone. ""All I've ever wanted was justice for James and getting that justice would be them two going from young offenders to a proper prison and spend proper time in there."" Speaking outside court after the ruling, solicitor-advocate Robin Makin, for the Bulgers, said ""the authorities seem to be hell-bent on protecting [Venables] regardless of the risk to others"" and that was the ""primary driving force"" behind the application. Sir Andrew refused permission to appeal against the ruling but Mr Makin said the Bulgers may consider pursuing a challenge at the Court of Appeal.

Charles link to Russian offshore network,"Ruben Vardanyan when still head of Troika, at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2010 An investment bank led by an oligarch who collaborated with Prince Charles on charity work managed a network of offshore companies moving billions out of Russia. An international investigation has exposed how the network received money from companies linked to major fraud. The oligarch, Ruben Vardanyan, is the former boss of Moscow investment bank Troika Dialog. He says he was not involved in the bank's day to day operations. Money from the network was sent to the Prince's Charities Foundationto help restore Dumfries House, a stately home in Ayrshire. The prince's charities said they had subjected Mr Vardanyan's donations to robust due diligence and no red flags had been raised. The prince, the oligarch and the stately home Dumfries House The web of more than 70 offshore companies is exposed in a leak of 1.3 million confidential bank transactions to the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), a consortium of east European investigative journalists who shared information and documents with the BBC and the Guardian. Between 2009 and 2011 the Prince's Charities Foundation received three payments, adding up to $202,000 via a now-defunct bank in Lithuania. The leaked bank data show the last of the payments went to an account held by the Prince's Charities Foundation. The payments were from a company called Quantus Division Ltd, which is revealed today to have been part of a network of offshore companies that sent billions of dollars out of Russia. The network was managed by a Moscow investment bank, Troika Dialog, whose chief executive at the time was Mr Vardanyan. Mr Vardanyan says that as well as being Chief Executive, he was also a private client of Troika Dialog and any donations to the Prince's Charities Foundation were from his personal funds. Over the years, Mr Vardanyan enjoyed an ongoing charitable and business relationship with the Prince of Wales. In 2010, Mr Vardanyan attended an event celebrating Armenia and its culture at Windsor Castle where the Prince spoke about Dumfries House and his plans to restore it. Most of the leaked records are from the Lithuanian bank Ukio Bancas, shut down by the Lithuanian authorities in 2013. Between 2005 and 2011 more than â¬3.35bn was moved into a network of offshore companies managed by Troika Dialog and â¬3.5bn was moved out. The companies appear to have been used to move money anonymously. The Troika network of companies was set up as a service for clients, many of them members of Russia's elite, to move money around the world for both business and personal use. They used some of it to pay for everything from properties in the UK to luxury yachts, artwork and World Cup tickets. Ruben Vardanyan and his partners made $1bn between them in 2011 when they sold Troika to Sberbank, owned by the Russian state. A spokesperson for Sberbank said that the company did not participate the transactions uncovered in the investigation. Documents seen by the BBC suggest that companies in the network including Quantus Division Ltd made and received payments said to be for goods such as food, lighting, electronic goods, building materials and even sanitary ware. However, they were being purchased by companies with no offices, no employees and no trade, suggesting that in reality no such goods changed hands. Other bank records show tens of millions of dollars flowing into companies in the network from other companies linked to major crimes. They include one of the largest frauds to have been exposed in Russia, the $230m tax fraud discovered by Russian tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. In November 2009, nearly a year after reporting the fraud, Mr Magnitsky died in suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison. Leaked bank records from Ukio Bancas show companies that benefited from the tax fraud sent $123m through the Troika network. The BBC has seen no evidence that Mr Vardanyan was himself involved in any criminal activity. His lawyers told us he was not involved in the operations, management or activities of the wealth management arm of Troika Dialog Group, and that he has always acted in a transparent way. A spokesman for Clarence House said the Prince of Wales's charities operate independently of the prince himself in relation to all decisions around fundraising. A spokesman for The Prince of Wales' Charitable Foundation and The Dumfries House Trust told us: ""The charities apply robust due diligence processes.  In the case of the examples highlighted, no red flags arose during those processes.

The Prodigy's Keith Flint dies aged 49,"This video can not be played Prodigy singer Keith Flint dies age 49 The Prodigy singer Keith Flint has died aged 49. Instantly recognisable by his fluorescent spiked hair and known for high-octane performances, Flint sang lead vocals on both the band's number one singles, Breathe and Firestarter. He was found dead at his home in Dunmow, Essex, on Monday morning. The band, who were due to tour the US in May, confirmed his death in a statement, remembering Flint as a ""true pioneer, innovator and legend"". In a post on The Prodigy's official Instagram account, bandmate Liam Howlett added: ""I can't believe I'm saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend. ""I'm shell-shocked... angry, confused and heartbroken."" It emerged on Tuesday that Flint took part in a 5km park run in Chelmsford two days before his death. Organisers of the run said he posted a personal best time of 21 minutes 22 seconds and said they ""wished he could have been part of our parkrun community for longer than he was"".

Blunt tweeted about an awards show ""years ago"" when, he said, some artists declined to be pictured with him, adding: ""Keith Flint came over, gave me a hug, and said how thrilled he was for my success."" He wrote: ""Keith, I only met you once, but I shed a tear at the news of your death. In our business, there are no prizes for being kind, but if there was, that Grammy would be yours.""

Keith Flint and Gail Porter walked hand-in-hand at the London premiere of Mad Cows, at the Odeon West End cinema, Leicester Square in 1999 Born Keith Charles Flint on 17 September 1969, the singer had an unhappy childhood in Braintree, Essex, feuding with his parents, who split when he was young. A bright boy with dyslexia, he was disruptive in class, and was thrown out of school at the age of 15. Finding work as a roofer, he immersed himself in the acid house scene of the late 80s - meeting Howlett at an open-air rave in 1989. Impressed by Howlett's DJ skills, he approached him and asked for a personalised mixtape. Howlett obliged, scoring the word ""Prodigy"" on the cover in reference to his favourite synthesiser and putting a selection of his original songs on the B-side. Flint was so impressed that he encouraged Howlett to pursue music professionally, offering up his services as a dancer. ""I loved his music and, 'Boom!' I was in,""he told FHM magazine,external. ""I was never the brains behind the band - that was always Liam. But together we were a complete package. It was the outlet I was looking for."" Completed by Leeroy Thornhill, The Prodigy scored early hits with Everybody In The Place, Out Of Space and Charly - which sampled the dialogue from an old children's safety film: ""Always tell your mummy before you go off somewhere."" Their music matured on their second album, Music For The Jilted Generation, which introduced new band member MC Maxim and saw Howlett incorporate breakbeats, guitar loops and hip-hop samples on tracks such as No Good (Start The Dance) and Voodoo People. The album was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize - but the band truly went global when Flint grabbed the mic and unleashed the full fury of his voice on the abrasive, in-your-face rave-rock anthem Firestarter. The lyrics  - ""I'm the firestarter / Twisted firestarter""- were the first he'd written for the band. ""It didn't really have anything to do with starting fires,"" he told the BBC in 1996. ""It was when you're in front of 5,000 people and you can go out there - and just with the aid of the music and a visual performance, you can stir all them people up into a frenzy and that's almost like starting a massive fire, or a riot."" Firestarter's black-and-white video, featuring a headbanging Flint in an abandoned Tube station, was blacklisted by the BBC after it was shown on Top of the Pops and parents complained it had frightened their children (a truncated version was shown subsequently). Despite that, it knocked Take That's How Deep Is Your Love off the top of the charts, in 1996, selling more than 600,000 copies in the UK alone. Allow YouTube content?

Spurred by its success, the band's third album, Fat of The Land, went to number one in both the US and UK, selling several million copies worldwide. Flint stepped up as a frontman, giving The Prodigy a focal point for their live shows - including a notable headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997. Festival organiser Emily Eavis called it a ""huge, unforgettable moment,external"" - paying tribute to Flint on Twitter following his death - and revealed that The Prodigy had been booked for this year's event. Following the success of Fat of the Land, the band faltered. Howlett disowned the single Baby's Got A Temper, which included a controversial lyric about the ""date rape"" drug Rohypnol, while Flint recorded a largely forgotten solo album, Device #1, in 2003. While remaining part of the band, Flint did not feature on their 2004 album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, on which vocal duties were handled by Liam and Noel Gallagher and actress Juliette Lewis, among others. During this period, Flint said he had had depression and formed a worrying dependence on prescription drugs. ""I'd line up rows of pills and just take them and take them and I'd lose track of how many until I passed out,""he told The Times in 2009,external. The band supported Oasis at their Knebworth gigs in 1996 He decided to get clean after meeting Japanese DJ Mayumi Kai, giving up drugs, cigarettes and alcohol around the time of their marriage, in 2006. Three years later, The Prodigy regrouped and returned to their classic sound, on the album Invaders Must Die. The first single, Omen, was a major success, and the band returned to festival stages and stadiums around the world. Their most recent album, No Tourists, went to number one last November. Flint was also a keen motorcyclist andhad his own team- Team Traction Control - which has won four Isle Of Man TT races. He had recently wrapped up a tour with The Prodigy in Australia and was due to join them in the US in May. In a statement, Essex police said: ""We were called to concerns for the welfare of a man at an address in Brook Hill, North End, just after 08:10 on Monday, 4 March. ""We attended and, sadly, a 49-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed. ""The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner."" Flint did not have any children. Allow Twitter content?

Struggling towns to get post-Brexit funding,"A Â£1.6bn government fund has been launched to boost less well-off towns in England after Brexit. The pot is split into Â£1bn, divided in England using a needs-based formula, and Â£600m communities can bid for. More than half of the money, to be spread over seven years, will go to the north of England and the Midlands. Labour called it a bribe to influence MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal and critics say it does not cover cuts to local authority funding. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there will be additional announcements ""in due course"" for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. No Welsh cash in Â£1.6bn post-Brexit fund Council spending cuts, in seven charts 'Worst yet to come' in council cuts Brexit: All you need to know In January, MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. To win another vote, which Mrs May has promised will be on or before 12 March, she could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, told the PM last month to ""show us the money"" with ""transformative investment"" in areas that voted to leave. The Labour MP, who backed Mrs May's Brexit deal at the first vote, denied it amounted to ""transactional politics"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: âObviously, I wouldnât turn down any moneyâ¦ but my vote is not for saleâ But John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the fund ""smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the money will be targeted on coastal communities, market towns, and de-industrialised towns, which meets the demands of some Labour MPs, who say regeneration funding tends to go to big cities. The funding will go to specific projects like a new university campus or railway station, our correspondent added. Dismissing the claim that the funding aimed to entice Labour MPs, Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire insisted the cash would be made available even if the withdrawal agreement was rejected and denied the funding was a bribe. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country."" He said the money would ""supplement the work of councils"" and could be ""transformative"" and was there ""to see that towns grow"". However, Labour MP Alex Sobel, of the cross-party People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, said it was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with the cost of leaving the EU. He said the annual loss to local economies would be more than enough to wipe out any potential return from this scheme. Theresa May, pictured with her husband Philip, has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March Labour's Ruth Smeeth, the MP for Leave-supporting Stoke-on-Trent, described the amount of money as ""extraordinarily pathetic"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, she said: ""If you're talking about national renewal, this is less money than is being taken out of my economy by the introduction of [new welfare system] universal credit over the next four years."" Labour and Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell said the announcement was a ""huge disappointment"", tweeting: ""The entire allocation for the West Midlands over four years is less than the total value of cuts faced by Stoke-on-Trent City Council alone over the same period."" Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, has described the funding as ""a shameless little bung."" She told BBC Radio 5 Live that Â£90m had been lost from her local council over nine years of austerity and the money was ""bobbins"" and was ""shameless and embarrassing"". And Labour's Rhondda MP Chris Bryant tweeted: ""And not a penny for Wales. The trouble with bribes is they embody injustice."" Welsh councils facing real-terms cuts Austerity blamed for children in care rise A really simple guide to all things Brexit But the prime minister insisted: ""Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change - that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control. ""These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them."" She said prosperity had been ""unfairly spread"" for ""too long"". By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson A month ago John Mann - who voted to leave the EU - told the BBC there was a ""good dialogue"" going on with the government. And he was hopeful Mrs May would come back with ""something significant"" for his, and other, areas outside London. He and a group of Labour MPs from Leave areas were demanding the protection of employment rights after Brexit - and assurances poorer areas wouldn't lose out when EU regional funding ended. The cash on offer from the government is equivalent to less than 2% of English local authority spending. Theresa May says she is simply making good a promise she made in her first speech as prime minister to help ""ordinary working class families"". But the Labour leadership see this as a ""bribe"" to tempt some of their own MPs to break ranks and back Mrs May's deal. The former Conservative, now Independent, MP Anna Soubry claims it's an attempt to buy votes. But the government insists the true beneficiaries will be residents of coastal and industrial communities who feel left behind. The Â£1.6bn Stronger Towns Fund will be broken down into Â£600m, which communities in any part of England can bid for, and Â£1bn allocated using a needs-based formula to the following areas: North-west England:Â£281m North-east England:Â£105m Yorkshire and the Humber:Â£197m West Midlands:Â£212m East Midlands:Â£110m South-west England:Â£33m South-east England:Â£37m East England:Â£25m ""The formula allocations are based on a combination of productivity, income, skills, deprivation metrics and proportion of the population living in towns,"" a department spokesperson said. ""This targets funding at those places with economies that are performing relatively less well to the England average."" London is not included in the list, but towns within Greater London can bid for a share of the Â£600m pot, the department spokesperson added. The government said communities would be able to draw up job-boosting plans for their town, with the support and advice of their Local Enterprise Partnerships. It added that it would also seek to ensure towns in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would benefit from the new funding.

Aid worker says UK citizenship loss 'unfair',"This video can not be played Tauqir Sharif tells the BBC's Lucy Manning it is unfair to have his citizenship taken away A British-born aid worker in Syria has criticised the government's decision to strip him of his citizenship - but admitted that he previously fought in the country and carried an AK47 rifle. Tauqir Sharif, from east London, moved to Syria with his wife seven years ago. In 2017, the Home Office removed his British citizenship, saying it had seen secret intelligence and believed he had links to a group aligned with al-Qaeda. Mr Sharif denies the links and calls the decision ""unfair"" and ""racist"". He also said he carried the AK47 only to defend himself from bandits and armed groups. Responding to the row, the Home Office said any decision to deprive someone of their citizenship was based ""on all available evidence and not taken lightly"". US to leave 200 troops after Syria pullout Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Tauqir Sharif has been working in Syria as an aid worker for a charity he founded Mr Sharif, 31, from Walthamstow, had his citizenship removed by the then-home secretary Amber Rudd in 2017. As Mr Sharif is entitled to Pakistani nationality through his father, the UK government is allowed to deprive him of his British citizenship as he would not become stateless. Mr Sharif's wife is British, as are their five children who have all been born in Syria since they moved there. The couple have been unable to obtain passports for their children. A Home Office letter to Mr Sharif said he was deprived of his citizenship because ""it is assessed that you are a British/Pakistani dual national who has travelled to Syria and is aligned to an AQ (al-Qaeda) aligned groupâ¦ your return to the UK would present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom"". The letter added: ""My decision has been taken in part reliance on information which, in my opinion, should not be made public in the interest of national security."" Mr Sharif is appealing against the decision and had until recently been granted anonymity by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission - the semi-secret court which decides on national security immigration cases. He has chosen to waive his rights to anonymity in order to tell his story. Around 150 dual nationals have had their British citizenship removed by the Home Office to date. Recently, Shamima Begum - the London teenager who fled the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria but now wants to come home -had her British citizenship taken awayby the government. Mr Sharif works for an aid distribution charity in Idlib, an area of north-western Syria. There has been civil war in Syria for eight years. More than 360,000 people have died and more than 11 million people have been displaced or fled abroad. The war began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, who responded with deadly force. The violence has since escalated and many more groups - each with their own agenda - became involved. The chaos has allowed jihadist groups including Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda to flourish. In 2014, IS proclaimed a ""caliphate"" and once controlled 34,000 square miles of territory, imposing a brutal rule on nearly eight million people. Now, it has been all but eliminated. Why is there a war in Syria? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Syria country profile Idlib, where Mr Sharif works, is still controlled by a patchwork of jihadist factions. The strongest faction amongst them isHTS,an organisation which evolved from the Nusra Front - al-Qaeda's Syrian offshoot. Asked by the BBC whether he was aligned to a group linked to al-Qaeda, Mr Sharif said: ""Of course not. ""I mean I came out here to help the innocent, people that were being massacred by the Bashar regime. I am an aid worker. Mr Sharif set up a charity called Live Updates From Syria ""I'm saying 'OK, if there's evidence, put me in front of a jury and I will win'. I believe that 100%. But to say that there's secret evidence and it's too secret for us to share with you I think that's unfair."" Mr Sharif said a system in which the children of immigrants could be deprived of British citizenship, but other British subjects could not, was racist and unfair, and that he was speaking out to highlight the injustice, not because he was attempting to return to the UK. Mr Sharif's lawyer, Daniel Furner from Birnberg Peirce, said the Home Office should be clear about what evidence it had against his client. ""He's been driving ambulances, delivering aid. He's done nothing to warrant the deprivation of his citizenship."" Challenged that the government must have information suggesting otherwise, Mr Furner said: ""Well, tell us what it is. Give us some indication of what it is so that we can defend it. Because Mr Sharif doesn't accept that."" But others expressed more scepticism. Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the think tank Chatham House, said many people who had gone to fight in Syria did so under the pretext of doing charity work. She added: ""Certainly all the aid workers I know have never picked up guns in conflict."" Mr Sharif also said he was not ""apologetic"" about having to defend himself in Syria. ""You know I have on occasion had to defend myself and other Syrian people. I've been on distributions where we have been surrounded, nearly besieged in Aleppo."" And pressed on whether his admission that he had to defend himself meant he had fought and carried a weapon, Mr Sharif confirmed that was the case - but said that did not mean he was a fighter. He said that up until 2017 he had carried an AK47 rifle while delivering aid because of, he claims, the risk of kidnap and theft from bandits and armed groups. He also said he had previously been involved in firefights when convoys had come under attack. For some years he said he had been unable to afford armed security for his convoys but since 2017 he has had security guards to protect aid deliveries. Mr Sharif added that Syria remained dangerous and he still carried a handgun for protection. Condemning IS, Mr Sharif said: ""ISIS has tried to kill me. ISIS has tried to blackmail me. ""They even say that I'm not Muslim because I didn't join their caliphate and all of this kind of stuff. They are a bigger threat to Muslims [than to anyone else] and have killed so many Muslims here in Syria."" This video can not be played Tauqir Sharif left Newham in 2012 Mr Sharif's province, Idlib, is one of the last pockets of resistance to President Assad and is surrounded on three sides by regime forces and their Iranian and Russian allies. Should it fall, Mr Sharif and his family will face a dilemma. He said he did not expect to win his appeal to have his citizenship reinstated and, while he would like his children to be educated in Britain, it was more likely that the family would try to resettle in Turkey. Responding to Mr Sharif's criticism, a Home Office spokesman said the home secretary's priority was ""the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here"". ""In order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless. ""We do not comment on individual cases, but any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.""

Burns survivor is face of beauty campaign,"This video can not be played Catrin Pugh: 'I have never been able to open a magazine and seen someone I can relate to' A woman who suffered burns to 96% of her body in a crash in the French Alps is the face of a new beauty campaign. Catrin Pugh from Rossett, Wrexham, was given a one in 1,000 chance of survival and has had 200 operations since the 2013 crash near Alpe D'Huez. Catrin, now 25, is determined to help represent people who look different in the media, and is the face of Avon's new Perfect Nudes beauty range. She was inspired to change things while reading a magazine in hospital. Catrin before and after the accident, which happened when she was 19 Catrin Pugh has been advising Avon on diversity ""Every single page was about looking a certain way, all these things that were completely unattainable for me,"" she said. ""It does make life difficult because I look so different in a world where people are supposed to look a certain way... I don't meet the standard what that should be, there's this idea that beauty is one way."" Are CGI models taking over fashion? Hijab shampoo advert a 'game-changer' The 86-year-old skydiver turned model Catrin was amongmore than 50 passengers on the coachwhich was taking ski resort staff back to the UK when it crashed, killing the 63-year-old driver. She spenteight months in hospitaland underwent about four years of rehabilitation, and will continue to have checks and procedures for the rest of her life. Only the soles of her feet were not burnt. Only the soles of Catrin's feet were not burnt Catrin, an ambassador for the charity Changing Faces which supports people with a visible difference, began to advise the beauty company Avon on diversity. She said it has been ""empowering"". ""At the time [of the accident] I didn't feel like there were many role models at all,"" she said. And while Catrin says the situation has improved with regard to size, race and age - she says there is still not much representation for people with visible differences like scarring. Catrin says she still experiences some negativity, but she takes strength from how lucky she was to survive the accident. Catrin Pugh was given a one in 1,000 chance of survival after the crash ""I shouldn't be here... People aren't supposed to survive. Somehow, I made it through. ""I've come a very long way but it never really ends for the rest of my life. ""But I got the best of an awful situation, I shouldn't be here so every opportunity I get to do something, I celebrate that.""

Mayo, 60, is hosting a mid-morning show on digital station Scala Radio, which broadcast for the first time on Monday. Mayo opened his first show by quoting the late Alan Freeman and dedicating a track to ""old friend"" Jo Whiley.

Charles link to Russian offshore networkAn investment bank led by an oligarch with links to Prince Charles managed a network of offshore companies.Business,"Ruben Vardanyan when still head of Troika, at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2010 An investment bank led by an oligarch who collaborated with Prince Charles on charity work managed a network of offshore companies moving billions out of Russia. An international investigation has exposed how the network received money from companies linked to major fraud. The oligarch, Ruben Vardanyan, is the former boss of Moscow investment bank Troika Dialog. He says he was not involved in the bank's day to day operations. Money from the network was sent to the Prince's Charities Foundationto help restore Dumfries House, a stately home in Ayrshire. The prince's charities said they had subjected Mr Vardanyan's donations to robust due diligence and no red flags had been raised. The prince, the oligarch and the stately home Dumfries House The web of more than 70 offshore companies is exposed in a leak of 1.3 million confidential bank transactions to the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), a consortium of east European investigative journalists who shared information and documents with the BBC and the Guardian. Between 2009 and 2011 the Prince's Charities Foundation received three payments, adding up to $202,000 via a now-defunct bank in Lithuania. The leaked bank data show the last of the payments went to an account held by the Prince's Charities Foundation. The payments were from a company called Quantus Division Ltd, which is revealed today to have been part of a network of offshore companies that sent billions of dollars out of Russia. The network was managed by a Moscow investment bank, Troika Dialog, whose chief executive at the time was Mr Vardanyan. Mr Vardanyan says that as well as being Chief Executive, he was also a private client of Troika Dialog and any donations to the Prince's Charities Foundation were from his personal funds. Over the years, Mr Vardanyan enjoyed an ongoing charitable and business relationship with the Prince of Wales. In 2010, Mr Vardanyan attended an event celebrating Armenia and its culture at Windsor Castle where the Prince spoke about Dumfries House and his plans to restore it. Most of the leaked records are from the Lithuanian bank Ukio Bancas, shut down by the Lithuanian authorities in 2013. Between 2005 and 2011 more than â¬3.35bn was moved into a network of offshore companies managed by Troika Dialog and â¬3.5bn was moved out. The companies appear to have been used to move money anonymously. The Troika network of companies was set up as a service for clients, many of them members of Russia's elite, to move money around the world for both business and personal use. They used some of it to pay for everything from properties in the UK to luxury yachts, artwork and World Cup tickets. Ruben Vardanyan and his partners made $1bn between them in 2011 when they sold Troika to Sberbank, owned by the Russian state. A spokesperson for Sberbank said that the company did not participate the transactions uncovered in the investigation. Documents seen by the BBC suggest that companies in the network including Quantus Division Ltd made and received payments said to be for goods such as food, lighting, electronic goods, building materials and even sanitary ware. However, they were being purchased by companies with no offices, no employees and no trade, suggesting that in reality no such goods changed hands. Other bank records show tens of millions of dollars flowing into companies in the network from other companies linked to major crimes. They include one of the largest frauds to have been exposed in Russia, the $230m tax fraud discovered by Russian tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. In November 2009, nearly a year after reporting the fraud, Mr Magnitsky died in suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison. Leaked bank records from Ukio Bancas show companies that benefited from the tax fraud sent $123m through the Troika network. The BBC has seen no evidence that Mr Vardanyan was himself involved in any criminal activity. His lawyers told us he was not involved in the operations, management or activities of the wealth management arm of Troika Dialog Group, and that he has always acted in a transparent way. A spokesman for Clarence House said the Prince of Wales's charities operate independently of the prince himself in relation to all decisions around fundraising. A spokesman for The Prince of Wales' Charitable Foundation and The Dumfries House Trust told us: ""The charities apply robust due diligence processes.  In the case of the examples highlighted, no red flags arose during those processes.

Rescuers seek Alabama tornado victims,"This video can not be played Tornado damage in Alabama At least three children have died in eastern Alabama after two tornadoes caused extensive damage to buildings and roads, rescue officials say. At least 23 people are known to have died in Lee County, withthe youngest believed to have been six years old,external. There are fears that the death toll will rise as emergency crews dig through rubble. Dozens more are hurt. The sheriff of Lee County, Jay Jones, told local media that the devastation caused by the winds was ""incredible"". He said: ""It looks like someone has taken a giant knife and scraped the ground. There are slabs where homes formerly stood, debris everywhere... whole forested areas with trees are snapped and lying on the ground... a lot of devastation out there."" Lee County coroner Bill Harris said on Monday that at least three children - aged six, nine, and 10 - were among the dead. Taylor Thornton was named as one of the young victims. Her school, Lee-Scott Academy, announced the news on Monday and directed people to an online fundraising page to support her family with funeral expenses. ""She never met a stranger - everybody was a friend,"" her uncle James Thornton told Reuters news agency. ""She had a huge life at 10 years old. She had a footprint bigger than most people who are 70, 80, 90 years old."" Six-year-old AJ Hernandez Jr was alsoidentified by family members on social media,external, with his aunt calling him a ""precious little man"". Taylor Thornton was listed among the dead. ""I will miss your little smile and your sweet voice and face,"" Tina Melton wrote on Facebook. ""He was always eager to give hugs and loved his family."" Nearly 2,000 homes in the affected area are without power,externalfollowing the tornadoes. How a tornado is formed,external A state of emergency is in operation, with resources from across Alabama pouring into the affected area. Drones with infrared capability are being used in an attempt to find survivors. The area around Beauregard, about 60 miles (95km) east of Alabama's state capital Montgomery, appears to have borne the brunt. The tornadoes there struck at about 14:00 (20:00 GMT) on Sunday, carving a path at least a half a mile wide and at least a mile long. Footage of the aftermath shows snapped communications poles, roads littered with debris and wrecked houses. The National Weather Service (NWS) made a classification of at least EF-3 - meaning winds of up to 165mph. Local resident Scott Fillmer said: ""Everything just kind of went dark, when it was almost like night outside. And it's that old clichÃ© that it sounds like a freight train coming, well that's what it sounded like."" Residents of Smiths Station told local TV they had seen businesses destroyed there. A large bar called the Buck Wild Saloon had its roof torn off. Beauregard was one of the worst-hit areas A tornado as seen in Dothan in Alabama on Sunday Tornado warnings were also issued for Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. Footage showed smashed buildings and snapped trees in Talbotton, about 80 miles south of Atlanta. A sign from a flea market in Lee County was found 20 miles away in Hamilton, Georgia. All of the deaths reported so far have been in Lee County. Authorities say they are still working to identify the victims and the injured. ""We've never had a mass fatality situation, that I can remember, like this in my lifetime,""Lee County coroner Bill Harris said,external. Allow Twitter content?

Alabama meteorologist Eric Snitil tweeted thatthere had been more tornado deaths in Lee County in one day than in the whole US during 2018,external. Several tornadoes hit the region on Sunday including here at Warner Robins, Georgia Several people were reported hurt in Talbotton in Georgia, though none seriously. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey posted on Twitter to warn residents there could be more extreme weather to come. ""Our hearts go out to those who lost their lives in the storms that hit Lee County today,"" she wrote. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe... To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!"" Apple CEO Tim Cook, who was born in Mobile in the south-west of the state, said he was ""devastated"" by the news,external, saying Lee County was ""a place close to my heart"". This series has occurred earlier than the traditional peak season for tornadoes, which runs from April to June, when more than half of the year's tornadoes generally strike. Weather systems are more conducive in these months. Warm air flows north from the Gulf of Mexico at the same time as storm systems are propelled into the south and mid-west by a southward dip in the jet stream. These latest tornadoes appear to have caused the highest death toll since 35 people were killed in Arkansas and Mississippi in April 2014. A ""super outbreak"" of tornadoes across a swathe of the US in April 2011 killed more than 300 people. Are you in the area?

Brexit Britain will be 'lost in space',"Planet satellites launch from the space station: The firm has some 150 operational spacecraft One of the UK's most successful space entrepreneurs has launched a withering attack on Brexit, labelling it ""galactic scale stupidity"". Will Marshall'sPlanet company,externaloperates the world's largest satellite imaging network, with 150 spacecraft able to fully picture Earth on a daily basis. He warns EU withdrawal will do immense harm to Britain's space industry. The UK will be ""lost in space"", he says. The UK Space Agency responded by saying home businesses had a positive outlook. The most recent survey of confidence across the sector found that three-quarters of organisations expected growth over the next three years, it added. Dr Marshall, a Nasa employee before founding Planet, airs his concernsin a blog posting,external. ""Post Brexit, no CEO would locate a space company [in the UK],"" he argues. ""Why put your European base outside the single market of the largest trading block in the world?! Or likely without access to the main government programmes? Company after company will avoid it,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Satellites show extent of volcano collapse Money released for 'UK sat-nav' study OneWeb launches pathfinder satellites Dr Marshall says the idea of a UK sat-nav system is ""pie in the sky"" Dr Marshall holds particular scorn for the UK government's actions on Galileo, the EU version of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Ministers have decided to walk away from the project because Brussels says a future Britain, as a ""third country"" outside the EU, cannot be involved in the system's most secure elements - this despite the UK having already invested Â£1.5bn in Galileo. London says it will build its own sat-nav system instead, but Dr Marshall calls this a ""pie in the sky"" plan that has significant economic and security implications. ""The costs would dwarf the entire UK space budget,"" he writes, and all for a redundant system that is ""likely years behind and second tier to that of its close allies!"" Planet's view of Brussels: The EU is an ever more dominant force in European space activity Dr Marshall's enterprise is headquartered in California, with a European base in Germany. Founded along with Robbie Schingler and Chris Boshuizen in 2010 - Planet has led a revolution in Earth observation that's based on the use of low-cost, shoe-box-sized satellites. Europe as a whole is racing to catch up, although the UK - it has to be said - has been better placed than most. Companies like Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd pioneered the use of commercial off-the-shelf components to reduce the cost of spacecraft manufacturing, and Clyde Space of Glasgow is now one of the go-to producers of just the type of satellites used by Planet. But the former Oxford and Leicester physicist worries that his home country is pulling itself out of a space ecosystem in which it has become embedded and on which so much of its capability depends. The UK puts about three-quarters of its civil space budget through the European Space Agency (Esa) and has become a significant player in the EU's growing space activities - not just in Galileo but in Brussels' other big project: the Copernicus/Sentinel Earth observation system. Esa is a separate legal entity to the EU and ministers say Britain will stay in it even as the country leaves the wider union. But Esa and the EU are becoming ever more aligned, with Brussels nowthe single biggest contributor to the agency's budget- â¬1.25bn out of a total of â¬5.72bn per annum. The EU uses Esa as its technical and procurement agent. Many commentators believe the growing influence of Brussels within Esa is leading to tension, and that this unease will only heighten when a big agency member-state like Britain exits the EU. Dr Marshall shares this concern and warns the UK's voice within Esa will become diminished as a result. Sulawesi tsunami aftermath: Planet's satellites picture the entire Earth once a day ""Furthermore, in conversations with senior officials at the UK government during my recent trip there, it became terrifyingly clear that space is an afterthought to the larger political issues of Brexit: there is no plan to mitigate these impacts,"" he writes. A spokesperson for the UK Space Agency (UKSA) said Dr Marshall's pessimism was not shared across industry and pointed tothe recent ""Size and Health"" survey,externalof British space businesses. This found that 73% of organisations expected income to grow over the next three years and 48% of those expected that growth to be more than 10% higher than in the previous three years. ""Space is a truly global endeavour and a key part of the government's modern Industrial Strategy, with over Â£100m committed for new space infrastructure and a further Â£92m to develop options for a UK global satellite navigation system,"" the spokesperson told BBC News. ""We have an excellent track record of working closely with the sector to drive growth, create jobs and collaborate with partners in Europe and the rest of the world. ""This will continue once we leave the EU. We are committed to close international partnerships on space and science programmes, and will remain a leading member of the European Space Agency, which is independent of the EU."" Last week, OneWeb, an international start-up that has chosen to base itself in London, launched the first six satellites in what it hopes will become a near-2,000-spacecraft constellation to deliver internet broadband to every corner of the globe.

Missing girls found safe in US woodland,"The sheriff said Leia and Caroline Carrico were in good spirits when they were found Two sisters who wandered away from home and got lost in woodland for two days have been found safe and well. Leia Carrico, eight, and Caroline, five, from North California, spent 44 hours in a cold and rainy forest. The girls were found huddled under a bush, having survived drinking water from huckleberry leaves and eating cereal bars they had brought with them. They were ""in good spirits"", Humboldt Country Sheriff William Honsal said, adding their discovery was a ""miracle"". Caroline speaking with a firefighter shortly after being rescued The girls' mother, Misty Carrico, alerted authorities when she noticed her daughters were missing on Friday afternoon. The sisters had asked her if they could go for a walk around their home in Benbow, near the Eel River, but she had declined. After noticing her daughters were missing, Ms Carrico went looking for them with neighbours and friends, before calling the sheriff. Dozens of police and rescue officials, using helicopters and dogs, were involved in the search. They found the girls on Sunday morning, 1.4 miles (2.3km) from where they had set off, just hours before a rain storm was due to hit. Allow Twitter content?

The girls told rescuers that they had got lost following a deer trail and made the decision to stay put. They were reunited with their parents and assessed by paramedics, who said they were dehydrated and cold. Sheriff Honsal added that the girls had received some wilderness training from their youth club, 4-H, which may have helped them survive. ""It is so amazing to have such good news, to know they are safe,"" the sheriff said. ""We have so many of these kinds of efforts that end up in tears and tragedy.""

Applause greets Banks funeral cortege,"This video can not be played Goalkeepers Jack Butland, Joe Anyon, Kasper Schmeichel and Joe Hart acted as pallbearers World Cup final teammates of England goalkeeper Gordon Banks have attended his funeral, including hat-trick hero Sir Geoff Hurst whose eulogy described him as a ""superstar"". Hundreds of people lined the streets of Stoke-on-Trent as a cortege made its way around the city. The coffin was also driven to the home of Banks's former club Stoke City where hundreds more chanted and applauded. Jack and Sir Bobby Charlton were among mourners at a later church service. The brothers - who won the World Cup with Banks in 1966 - attended Stoke Minster where Wembley teammate Hurst paid tribute. Hurst said it was a ""very sad day"", describing his former teammate as the ""greatest goalkeeper we've had"". Applause greeted the arrival of the funeral cortege at Stoke City's bet365 Stadium The funeral started with a rendition of Abide with Me - a hymn synonymous with the FA Cup final. Monday's service was held on the 47th anniversary of Stoke City's 1972 League Cup final victory over Chelsea in which Banks played a leading role. Before the funeral, members of the public stood five or six-deep on pavements around Stoke-on-Trent, with people inside the bet365 Stadium chanting ""England's number one"" as Banks's achievements were displayed on a big screen. His coffin was carried by goalkeepers from his three ex-clubs, Stoke, Leicester City and Chesterfield. The pallbearers were Stoke and England goalkeeper Jack Butland; Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel; Chesterfield keeper Joe Anyon; and England and Burnley's Joe Hart. The service ended with a recording of the song My Way performed by Frank Sinatra. Veteran former goalkeepers (left to right) Pat Jennings, Ray Clemence and David Seaman were at the service Banks, who died on 12 February aged 81, started his career at Chesterfield before joining Leicester City in 1959 for Â£7,000. At Leicester, he established himself as England's number one, earning his first international cap in 1963 against Scotland. In eight years at Leicester, he was runner-up in two FA Cup finals and won the League Cup in 1964, before joining Stoke in 1967. Peter Shilton was at Leicester City at the same time as Banks, eventually taking over from him He stayed at the Potters until his retirement from professional football, winning the League Cup again in 1972, the club's only major honour. Fifa named him goalkeeper of the year six times and he earned 73 caps for England. He played in every game of the 1966 World Cup campaign, culminating in the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final at Wembley. Banks obituary - The career of a legend Daughter 'very proud' ahead of funeral Live updates from the funeral Hurst delivered a eulogy, describing Banks as ""a superstar on the field, [but] off the field he was an ordinary guy with no airs or graces"". He added: ""He was a joker, a funny man, for over 50 years, and every time we met during our careers or years after he would come up and joke.""

Outrage over singer's Instagram assault,"This is not the first time abuse against the singer has become a matter of national debate in South Africa South Africans have reacted angrily to a live video of a singer being beaten by what appears to be her boyfriend. Bongekile Simelane, known by the stage name Babes Wodumo, was talking to fans on Instagram Live in a bedroom when she was slapped repeatedly. Babes Wodumo is trending on Twitter in South Africa, as is the hashtag #StopWomenAbuse. Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said he was ""horrified"" and called on the singer to press charges. ""1. We're absolutley [sic] horrified by the actions of Musician Mapmpintsha @MampintshaNuz caught on video where he brutally abuses Internationally celebrated Artist @BABESWODUMO,""he tweeted,external, naming her boyfriend Mandla Maphumulo, also known as Mampintsha. ""We do not only condemn this senseless act but call on @BABESWODUMO to immediately press charges against him,"" he added. Mr Maphumulo has not commented on the video but in relation to similar accusations last year, he denied being an ""abuser"", reports Times Live. But he also added that he was ""no saint"". ""I may have overreacted in a couple of incidents during our relationship with her over certain things,"" he said. The singer, who featured on the Black Panther soundtrack, often collaborated with Mr Maphumulo, including onone of her most popular songs, Wololo,external. Violence against women is seen as a major problem in South Africa. A2016 study by Statistics SA,externalfound that 1 in 5 women report that they have experienced violence at the hands of a partner. This video can not be played Thembi Maphanga was doused in petrol and set alight by her partner The singer's sister, Nonduh Simelane, told entertainment news site The Juice that the 24-year-old Gqom singer was ""traumatised but doing okay and is resting"". She also dismissed suggestions on social media that the video was set up to highlight the plight of domestic violence. People watching the video expressed shock, with one saying ""wait what?!"" before later adding ""not this again"". Africa Live: the latest updates from across the continent Will I be next? South Africa women ask Opposition political parties have also come out to condemn the attack. The EFF in KwaZulu-Natal says it intends to open a case with police to investigate footage,according to Times Live.,external Meanwhile, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, Mmusi Maimane, said that he wanted to fight the man himself. He said on video,externalthat he ""must go into a boxing ring and let's pick on someone his own size and I'd like to take him on"". This is not the first time the relationship has become a matter of national debate. In May last year, she was asked in a radio interview if Mr Maphumulo was abusing her, which led to a discussion about the ethics of how the interview was conducted. It is one of a spate of attacks against women that has sparked outrage in the country over the last two years. The murder of 22-year-old Karabo Mokoena by her ex-boyfriend shocked the country in 2017, with women using the hashtag #MenAreTrash.

Hunt for pair over stabbing of girl,"Jodie Chesney was fatally attacked in a park near Romford, east London Police are searching for two suspects they believe were involved in the stabbing of 17-year-old Jodie Chesney in east London. Jodie died at the scene of the attack in St Neot's Road, Harold Hill, at about 21:30 GMT on Friday. The Metropolitan Police said Jodie had been playing music with five other teenagers in a park when two males walked up to the group and one stabbed her once in the back. They ran off towards Retford Road. Officers said the pair had been seen in the park about half an hour earlier but had not spoken to Jodie or her group of friends. People have been laying flowers near the entrance to the part throughout Sunday The force said Jodie's attacker was a black male in his late teens but gave no further details, and said there were no descriptions of the second suspect. Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams urged any witnesses who had not spoken to police yet to contact him. ""There has been excellent support from the local community and a number of people have shared information with police, but there will be other witnesses and people with information that may prove crucial. ""Although the description of the suspect is limited, I am certain that people will have seen the two males hanging around the park or running away from the scene - or will otherwise have noticed something suspicious. I need those people to call me."" Jodie was earlier described as a ""bundle of joy and such a good person"" by one classmate, with another telling BBC News: ""She was so beautiful - inside and out. ""She was kind, wouldn't hurt anyone and would do anything to make anyone happy."" The playground where Jodie was found is called Amy's Play Site Acting Det Ch Supt John Ross said: ""Yesterday a 17-year-old girl lost her life, and I want to express my deepest sympathies to [Jodie's] family and friends. ""Her death is a tragedy. I can reassure them and the whole community that we are doing everything possible to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible. ""It is days like these that really do highlight how we must continue to work tirelessly with our partners and the public to tackle knife crime."" People visited the area near the crime scene to lay flowers throughout the weekend Flowers were left at the scene, with one message reading ""RIP Angel"" Jodie's family have issued an appeal on social media for witnesses to the attack. Her grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""How have we come to this point where kids can't have a walk in a park without suffering an unprovoked attack? ""If anyone knows anything about this please contact the police with information. ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" Police sealed off the area, known locally as Amy's Park, and conducted forensic searches, but no arrests have yet been made. Forensic officers searched trees near the park on Sunday morning The teenager's death comes less than a week after 20-year-old ChÃ© Morrisonwas stabbed to death outside Ilford train station in east London.

Trevor Noah sorry for India-Pakistan joke,"Trevor Noah has come under fire for making jokes over tensions between India and Pakistan Comedian Trevor Noah has said he is sorry for making jokes about the sharp rise in tensions between India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir. He said a war between the two would be ""the most entertaining"", adding ""it would also be the longest war of all time - another dance number!"" The gag, in an episode of The Daily Show, caused most anger in India where thousands poured fury onto Twitter. India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. Both countries claim all of Kashmir, but each controls only part of it. The events of the past two weeks has seen an almost unprecedented escalation, which culminated in Pakistan shooting down an Indian fighter jet and capturing an Indian pilot - they later released him. Shelling over the de facto border dividing Kashmir continued over the weekend, resulting in civilian casualties on both sides. Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it India and Pakistan in 'uncharted waters' After Noah's Daily Show appearance last week, criticism built up online which saw the South African comedian condemned as ""racist"" and ""insensitive"".

Twitter is the social media platform where political controversy in India tends to play out - and so this is where offence escalated most. In addition, there isn't a well established tradition of political satire in India, so Noah's comedy was bound to have its detractors. A Facebook page called Humans of Hindutva became notorious in India for poking fun at political leaders and parties. It amassed a large following quickly - but was also seen as very controversial in India and felt compelled to pause its satire. Indian celebrities have also been castigated for taking a political stand - and sometimes, for not taking one.

A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to retaliate with air strikes last week.

"Car buyers overcharged ÃÂ£1,000 for loans","Some car buyers are being overcharged by more than Â£1,000 when they take out a loan to buy a car, the UK's financial watchdog has warned. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the industry practice of allowing dealers to set their own interest rates was costing consumers Â£300m a year. Dealers overcharge to boost their commission, the FCA concluded. But the Finance and Leasing Association said the watchdog's survey was ""based largely on out-of-date information"". The regulator launched its investigation into the car finance market in April 2017 after there was a rapid surge in consumer credit led by car dealership finance. At the time, it said it was concerned about a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest. In its final findings on motor finance,external, the FCA concluded that the widespread use of commission models, which allow brokers discretion to set the customer's interest rate and thus earn higher commission, can lead to conflicts of interest that are not controlled adequately by lenders. It said the practice can lead to customers paying significantly more for their motor finance. Do new car finance deals spell trouble? Car and house insurance faces price probe Car sales see biggest fall since 2008 Jonathan Davidson of the FCA said: ""We found that some motor dealers are overcharging unsuspecting customers over a thousand pounds in interest charges in order to obtain bigger commission payouts for themselves. ""We also have concerns that firms may be failing to meet their existing obligations in relation to pre-contract disclosure and explanations, and affordability assessments. ""This is simply not good enough and we expect firms to review their operations to address our concerns."" Four-fifths of new car finance deals are now what are known as Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP. Instead of buying a car outright, a PCP allows consumers to effectively rent a car over a three or four-year period. At the end of the period consumers can buy the car for its residual value (known as a ""balloon"" payment), hand the car back, or roll over the residual value into a new PCP on a new vehicle. But problems have arisen because lenders have allowed brokers to set interest rates on the PCP agreements. The FCA estimated that on a typical motor finance agreement of Â£10,000, higher broker commission can result in the customer paying around Â£1,100 more in interest charges over a four-year term of an agreement. The FCA said it was assessing the options for intervening in the market. Options include strengthening existing rules or other steps such as banning certain types of commission model or limiting broker discretion. In the meantime, the regulator said it would deal with individual firms where problems were identified, but it expects all lenders and brokers to review the way they do business to make sure they comply with the law and treat customers fairly. The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a UK trade body for asset finance, consumer finance and motor finance, said that the FCA's survey work was ""based largely on out-of-date information, and therefore does not reflect the very considerable progress the market has already made in moving away from such structures"". The FCA analysed contracts between lenders and dealers from 2013 to 2016 and examined lenders' data from January 2017 to July 2018. The FLA added: ""We look forward to working with the FCA as it modernises its regulations in line with market best practice.""

Virgin drops make-up demand for cabin crew,"Virgin Atlantic has removed its long-standing requirement that female cabin crew wear make-up while on duty. Female cabin crew, whose uniform features a tight, red skirt, will also now be offered trousers automatically, rather than only when requested. It said it was a ""significant change"". Newer airlines, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, typically have relatively relaxed rules on uniform, but many longer-established airlines give rules on what make-up must be worn. The airline's first uniforms were designed by Arabella Pollen, a 23-year-old designer at the time of its launch in 1984. She created Virgin Atlantic's ""Virgin Red"". The most recent redesign was by Vivienne Westwood in 2014. What dress codes really mean for cabin crew Virgin said cabin crew could now work without make-up, but were welcome to follow the palette of lipstick and foundation set out in its guidelines. Virgin Atlantic spokesman Mark Anderson said: ""Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work."" The airline industry has been among the most conservative when it comes to appearance standards, although it is gradually changing. British Airways dropped its no-trouser rule for women in 2016, although it still requires female crew to wear make-up.

Tornadoes kill at least 23 in Alabama,"This video can not be played Tornado damage in Alabama At least 23 people have been killed as tornadoes struck Lee County in eastern Alabama, authorities say. County Sheriff Jay Jones said there had been ""catastrophic"" damage and there were fears more bodies would be found. Dozens are thought to have been hurt. Rescue efforts have been halted until dawn due to the danger of searching in the dark. The most devastating tornadoes struck the area around Beauregard, carving a path at least half a mile (0.8km) wide. The National Weather Service (NWS) made a classification of at least EF-3 - meaning winds of up to 165mph (266km/h). How a tornado is formed,external It warned people to ""stay out of damaged areas so first responders could do their job"". The area around Beauregard, about 60 miles (95km) east of Alabama's state capital, Montgomery, appears to have borne the brunt. The tornadoes there struck at about 14:00 (20:00 GMT) on Sunday. Footage showed snapped poles, roads littered with debris and houses without roofs. Sheriff Jones said some homes had been reduced to slabs. Authorities fear the death toll could rise. Local resident Scott Fillmer said: ""Everything just kind of went dark, when it was almost like night outside. And it's that old clichÃ© that it sounds like a freight train coming, well that's what it sounded like."" Residents of Smiths Station told local TV they had seen businesses destroyed there. A large bar called the Buck Wild Saloon had had its roof torn off. Beauregard was one of the worst hit areas A tornado as seen in Dothan in Alabama on Sunday Sheriff Jones said: ""The challenge is the sheer volume of the debris where all the homes were located. It's the most I've seen that I can recall."" Tornado warnings were also issued for Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. Footage showed smashed buildings and snapped trees in Talbotton, about 80 miles south of Atlanta. Tornadoes were also reported in Walton County and Cairo in northern Florida. All of the deaths so far have been in Lee County. Authorities say they are still working to identify the victims and the injured. One of the dead in Beauregard was an eight year old, family members said. ""We've never had a mass fatality situation, that I can remember, like this in my lifetime,""Lee County coroner Bill Harris said,external. Allow Twitter content?

This series has occurred earlier than the traditional peak season for tornadoes, which runs from April to June, when more than half of the year's tornadoes generally strike. Weather systems are more conducive in these months. Warm air flows north from the Gulf of Mexico at the same time as storm systems are propelled into the south and mid-west by a southward dip in the jet stream. These latest tornadoes appear to have carried the deadliest toll since 35 people were killed in Arkansas and Mississippi in April 2014. A ""super outbreak"" of tornadoes across a swathe of the US in April 2011 killed more than 300 people.

Ted Baker boss quits amid 'forced hugs' row,"Ray Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988 The founder and chief executive of fashion chain Ted Baker, Ray Kelvin, has resigned following allegations of misconduct, including ""forced hugging"". Mr Kelvin had been on a voluntary leave of absence since December last year following the misconduct allegations. These, which Mr Kelvin denies, are being investigated by the company. In a statement, Mr Kelvin said the company had been his ""life and soul"" but ""the right thing to do is to step away from Ted"". He said the past few months had been ""deeply distressing"" but he would support the team wherever he could offer ""helpful advice"". Mr Kelvin, who owns 35% of the company, will not receive any severance pay, and any bonus payments he has earned for the past three years' performance will lapse. In December, employees launched anonline petition accusing him of inappropriatecomments and behaviour. Ted Baker boss ""made us hug and slow dance"" Ted Baker shares tumble after profit warning Ted Baker boss takes leave of absence The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin said that it was ""only right"" that Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate. Mr Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988.

'Knife tsar' needed to stop stabbings,"This video can not be played Knife crime: Stella Creasy names Londoners killed so far in 2019 The home secretary has said there is ""no single solution"" to tackling knife crime, following two more young deaths. Former police chief Lord Hogan-Howe had earlier called for a knife crime tsar to be appointed to ""get a grip"" on the rise in youth violence. But Sajid Javid said he wished there was a simple answer to stopping the violence ""but there are no shortcuts"". It comes after two 17-year-olds were killed in separate incidents in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Tributes have been paid to Jodie Chesney,who was killed in an east London parkas she played music with friends, and to Yousef Ghaleb Makki, who was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. Yousef's family said in a statement: ""Yousef had only phoned home hours earlier to say that he would be home for his tea, but the next knock at the door were officers with the tragic news. ""It is every parent's worst nightmare."" Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart And on Monday, five people were arrested aftera gang armed with kniveswalked into a sixth-form college in Lancashire and threatened students, with one student receiving a minor injury. In a Commons debate, Walthamstow's Labour MP Stella Creasy read out the names of 18 young people who have been killed in London in 2019, adding: ""This is an emergency that requires an emergency response."" Lord Hogan-Howe, who led the Metropolitan Police force from 2011 to 2017, said a 93% rise in the number of under-16s stabbed over five years - revealed by Channel 4's Dispatches - was a ""terrifying statistic"" and ""something has to change"". He said a tsar, rather than individual police forces, should be put in charge of how money is spent to tackle knife crime - especially when it comes to officer recruitment. ""I'd want to know, week after week, when are you recruiting them? When do they arrive? When do they get trained? And when do they hit the streets?"" he told the BBC. ""If it's not treated as a crisis, it will take another two years before we see action."" Tsars are unelected independent advisers to the government who help to shape policy on a range of issues from drug misuse to how to reinvigorate the high street. This video can not be played Labour's Louise Haigh: Knife crisis requires leadership The home secretary, who will meet police chiefs this week to discuss the issue of knife crime, condemned the ""senseless violence"", saying: ""Young people are being murdered across the country. It can't go on."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she recognised people's concern, but insisted there was ""no direct correlation"" between the rise in knife crime anda fall in police numbers. The Met's Assistant Commissioner, Graham McNulty, said tackling violent crime ""remains the Met's priority"", adding officers from the violent crime unit worked extended shifts over the weekend. He said: ""The increased police presence has made a difference with officers conducting over 2,500 stop and searches in the last three days alone."" Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Dealing with rising tide of knife crime How Scotland stemmed the tide Rising knife crime in England and Wales: Ten charts NHS data shows that the number of children aged 16 and under treated for stab wounds in England rose from 180 in 2012-13 to 347 in 2017-18. Two boys, both aged 17, have been arrested on suspicion of Yousef's murder and remain in police custody. Officers say Jodie's attacker was a male in his late teens who stabbed her in the back without saying a word. There are no descriptions of a second suspect. Jodie's family branded it a ""totally random and unprovoked attack"". Labour councillor Tele Lawal said the government must ""wake up"" The Labour councillor for Heaton, Tele Lawal, who attended Jodie's sixth form college, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""She was a scout, loved by the community. To have a person like her taken away - is that not a wake-up call for our government? ""It shocks us all. For me as a councillor, what more can we be doing?"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Three teenagers, Hazrat Umar, Abdullah Muhammad and Sidali Mohamed (l-r), were stabbed to death recently in Birmingham Before you try to solve any problem, you need to know what's causing it. The Home Office says the spike in knife crime, and serious violence more generally, is largely being driven by disputes over drugs. So, with the National Crime Agency, it's set up a co-ordination centre to focus efforts on disrupting supply and catching dealers. But it's also clear many stabbings are not linked to drugs - they're part of a tit-for-tat cycle of street violence between gangs which breeds fear among young people and prompts them to carry weapons. There's a consensus that fixing that requires a two-pronged approach. More visible and intrusive policing, such as stop-and-search, to suppress the problem, together with longer-term prevention work (known as the public health model) to identify and support those at risk of being drawn into violent gangs at an early stage. Where there's disagreement is whether cuts to policing and other public services have played a role in the surge in violence. For ministers, to acknowledge resources are a factor would mean admitting their policies contributed to the problem and providing funding to rectify it.

What's going on with knife crime?,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

Home secretary: 'Knife crime can't go on',"Yousef Makki was murdered in Hale Barns, a quiet suburb where many top-flight footballers live The home secretary has condemned the ""senseless violence"" that has seen a rise in the number of teenagers being fatally stabbed in England and Wales. Sajid Javid was speaking after the murders of a 17-year-old girl in east London and a boy, also aged 17, in Greater Manchester at the weekend. He will meet police chiefs on Wednesday to look at ways to combat violence. Figures show the number of children in England aged 16 and under being stabbed rose by 93% in the five years to 2018. Mr Javid said: ""We're taking action on many fronts... It is vital that we unite to stop this senseless violence. ""Young people are being murdered across the country, it can't go on."" Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Fatal stabbings at highest level since 1946 Rising knife crime in England and Wales Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Hogan Howe, said the government should appoint a leader, or tsar, to ""get a grip"" on the problem, and that person should be in charge of how money is spent - especially on recruitment - not individual forces. ""I'd want to know, week after week, when are you recruiting them? When do they they arrive? When do they get trained? And when do they hit the streets?"" he told the BBC. ""You want to know day-by-day what's going to get delivered. And I don't get that sense of grip."" On Saturday evening,Yousef Ghaleb Makki, from Burnage, was stabbed to deathin the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. Two boys, also aged 17, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. Yousef's death came a day afterJodie Chesney was killed in a knife attackin an east London park on Friday night. The teenager was stabbed in the back as she played music with five friends in a park, the Metropolitan Police said. Officers say Jodie's attacker was a black male in his late teens but gave no further details. There are no descriptions of a second suspect. Jodie's family branded it a ""totally random and unprovoked attack"". Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The killings follow the deaths ofthree other teenagers in knife attacks in Birmingham in two weeks, prompting West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson to brand the situation a""national emergency"". Hazrat Umar, 17, was killed in Bordesley Green on Monday; Abdullah Muhammad, 16, died in Small Heath the previous week, and seven days earlier Sidali Mohamed, 16, was stabbed outside a college in Highgate. What London can learn from Scotland on tackling knife crime Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit Meanwhile, figures from an investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches programme suggest the number of children and young people in England and Wales linked to murders and manslaughters using knives has risen by more than 75% over three years. The number of police-recorded offenders aged under 18 rose from 26 to 46 between 2016 and 2018, the programme found after analysing Freedom of Information request responses from 29 out of 43 police forces. NHS data also shows that the number of children aged 16 and under treated for stab wounds in England rose from 180 in 2012-13 to 347 in 2017-18. The playground where Jodie was found is called Amy's Play Site The Home Office said it set out a range of actions to tackle violent crime in October. They include a Â£200m youth endowment fund; consultation on a new legal duty to underpin a public health approach to tackling serious violence, and an independent review of drug misuse. It said an extra Â£970m in police funding is proposed for 2019-20 and added that the offensive weapons bill currently before Parliament will introduce new offences to tackle knife crime and acid attacks. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said a week of national action on knife crime took 9,000 knives from the streets and saw more than 1,000 arrests. She said the #knifefree campaign aimed to make the point ""that the overwhelming majority of young people do not carry knives"".

'I'm victim of police conspiracy to rape',"Mark Kennedy (left) in his police uniform and (right) in his undercover days, when he used the name Mark Stone A woman who found out her partner was a policeman paid to spy on her group of activists has said she is the victim of a ""conspiracy to rape"". Rosa and another woman have spoken of feeling betrayed after falling in love with men who turned out to be spies. An ongoing public inquiry into undercover policing has seen several women get apologies and compensation. Police said officers who had long-term sexual relationships with their targets ""abused their positions"". ""If you put all these things together, you have a team of officers conspiring to rape,"" said Rosa - not her real name - who told BBC Wales Investigates she discovered the man she thought was her long-term partner was a paid police spy. ""They know there was no informed consent. ""It's the whole gang of them, and there's no other way of terming it for me than a gang. ""You've got mentors, you've got handlers a whole backroom team of people monitoring - and directing it would seem - their relationships, their activities."" Det Con Jim Boyling, who had a relationship with a woman he was spying on For the first time Rosa, and another woman - both from Wales - have revealed on camera the full story of how they became involved in intimate relationships which seemed genuine, but were in fact charades as police forces infiltrated groups they thought needed monitoring. BBC Wales Investigates has spoken to people and groups across the country coming to terms with finding out the men who posed as friends, fellow campaigners and in some cases lovers, were living a lie. In 2000, Rosa spent three months in South Africa looking for Jim Sutton, the man she was in love with. The trouble was that man did not really exist. Rosa met him in a London pub while she was a political activist in a group called Reclaim the Streets. The pair fell for each other quickly, to the extent that Rosa wanted to call the relationship off. Woman wants undercover officer prosecuted Police knew undercover officer was having sexual relationship Spy cops report 'will take eight years' Machynlleth woman on her life with undercover policeman ""It was too intense for meâ¦ I felt like I could forget to breathe. He seemed to be my life partner, he seemed to be some kind of blueprint I didn't even know I was looking for,"" she added. They were together for 10 months, but the man who called himself Jim Sutton was not who he claimed to be. He was an undercover policeman. Rosa said she and Jim were talking about having children, and moving to Wales, where she had family. Then Jim stunned her by saying he wanted to go travelling - on his own -  to ""sort his head out"". He left, saying his plan was to go to Turkey, Syria and then South Africa. After months missing, Jim got back in touch. Rosa started her own detective work, and could find no trace of the family he said he had. So she headed to South Africa, to find him. Jim Boyling, who used the name Jim Sutton while working as an undercover policeman ""I was walking round South Africa just saying 'excuse me have you seen this person?'. I was in torture, I needed answers."" She found no trace of him, and returned to the UK. Her search continued though, and clues led her to south London, and the offices of the secret police unit Jim worked for. Just two days later he re-appeared. ""I was in the fiction section - if you made a film out of this you'd say this is not realistic - and in he walked,"" she added. Rosa believes his reappearance was no coincidence. She believes she had triggered a response from the police and Jim had been sent to find out how much she knew. The encounter forced Jim to confess he had been living a lie. He was not Jim Sutton, he was police officer Jim Boyling. Rosa said he told her he actually empathised with activists like her and was not spying on them but was instead working on a separate, criminal investigation. She said this was another lie and said she was deceived for a second time - but that deception only came to light after she and Jim were married and had two children together. This video can not be played Two women had long-term relationships with men only to learn they were undercover officers Rosa said she was so damaged that she found it easy to believe Jim. ""The idea that my partner had never existed and was played by an actor, sent in by the state in order to spy on me as a peaceful green activist, was ludicrous and shook everything I believe in, so he was telling me stuff I knew, that I thought I knew,"" she added. There was no happy ending however. Rosa said Jim was controlling and manipulative - allegations he denies - and eventually she fled to a women's refuge in Wales and the couple divorced. Mark Stone and his partner of six years Lisa were on holiday in Italy in 2010 when she opened the glove compartment of his van looking for a pair of sunglasses. What she found inside would begin a process which dismantled undercover policing in the UK. It was a passport. The picture in it was the Mark she knew but the name next to it said his surname was Kennedy, not Stone. It also said he had children. Mark Kennedy with 'Lisa' during their relationship, when he called himself Mark Stone What Lisa did not know was that the man she knew as Mark Stone was an undercover policeman and had been paid to spy on her group of environmental activists. His covert deployment had just finished and he had handed back all his false documents - including his passport. It was a stroke of bad luck for him, and the Metropolitan Police, that she found the real one. Like Rosa, Lisa said the violation of trust by Mark and his employers feels like rape. ""It's been difficult for me to think of it in those words [rape] but I actually think that was what it was when it comes down to it. ""And the thing that also makes me feel even more violated, most violated, is that this deception, this relationship, this abuse wasn't just being perpetrated by one person. It wasn't just between myself and Mark, it was the whole police department."" Lisa, a committed environmental activist, met Mark in 2004. A willing participant in protests, he told her he was a professional climber. Although there were moments when Lisa had her suspicions, such as never meeting his parents, his stories about his difficult upbringing which left him with a frosty relationship with his family eased any concerns. On top of that, she was in love. ""He wasn't just somebody who was fleetingly in and out of my life. He was somebody I did everything with. I really did think we had a future together. This was somebody I was planning my life with,"" she said. In 2009, Mark suddenly left. He was gone for three months, with Lisa fearing he had had some sort of breakdown. Then, out of the blue, he returned. Their reunion led to the holiday in Italy, and the discovery of the fake passport. Undercover policeman Mark Kennedy on holiday with his partner Lisa and a friend began to investigate to find out who Mark really was and discovered he was married, had two children and lived in Ireland. Armed with this knowledge, Lisa and her fellow activists confronted Mark. In the face of the evidence, he had to admit who he really was. ""He was in tears and I was in tears,"" recalled Lisa. ""It was a hugely difficult and emotional evening. It's a very difficult memory to be thinking about."" The confirmation that Mark Kennedy was a police spy was the first step in the undercover policing network in England and Wales collapsing. Dozens of undercover officers were unmasked, and when it emerged that police had evenspied on the family of Stephen Lawrence, the teenager murdered in London in 1993, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - ordered apublic inquiry,external. The Metropolitan Police told BBC Wales Investigates: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has made clear its position on long-term, sexual relationships some undercover officers are known to have entered into with women in the past. These relationships were wrong and should not have happened. ""Undercover policing is a lawful and important tactic that takes dangerous offenders off the streets and helps protect communities, but cases such as these demonstrate that some officers abused their positions."" Policeman Mark Kennedy at the Glastonbury Festival during the time he was working undercover Mark Kennedy and Jim Boyling both declined interviews with BBC Wales Investigates. In a statement in April 2018, Jim said his relationship with Rosa was genuine, and did not come about because she was a person of interest to the police. ""I trust a more accurate picture of police covert operations may emerge from the Undercover Policing Inquiry, including perhaps the testimony of others who formed genuine relationships during the course of a deployment lasting several years,"" he said. Mark, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire in 2012, insisted his relationship with Lisa was built on genuine affection, and denied filing reports about her to the police. ""I know that the relationship we had - outside of what the names were - was probably one of the most loving experiences I've ever had,"" he said. In 2018 the Met admitted that Mark's handler and line manager knew about and approved himhaving a sexual relationship with another activist. Jim wassacked by the Metfor gross misconduct because of his relationship with Rosa. The disciplinary panel said: ""The system of control and governance over officers like DC Boyling was severely lacking."" But despite apologies from the police and compensation, Rosa and Lisa say their sense of betrayal remains. ""When people have had bereavement, you need to know what happened to a loved one before you can move on. In this case it almost feels as if there was a bereavement but I haven't just found out my partner has died, I found out he never existed in the first place,"" said Lisa.

Ted Baker founder quits amid hugging row,"Ray Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988 The founder and chief executive of fashion chain Ted Baker, Ray Kelvin, has resigned following allegations of misconduct, including ""forced hugging"". Mr Kelvin had been on a voluntary leave of absence since December last year following the misconduct allegations. These, which Mr Kelvin denies, are being investigated by the company. In a statement, Mr Kelvin said the company had been his ""life and soul"" but ""the right thing to do is to step away from Ted"". He said the past few months had been ""deeply distressing"" but he would support the team wherever he could offer ""helpful advice"". Mr Kelvin, who owns 35% of the company, will not receive any severance pay, and any bonus payments he has earned for the past three years' performance will lapse. In December, employees launched anonline petition accusing him of inappropriatecomments and behaviour. Ted Baker boss ""made us hug and slow dance"" Ted Baker shares tumble after profit warning Ted Baker boss takes leave of absence The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin said that it was ""only right"" that Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate. Mr Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988. It now has around 500 outlets in the UK and overseas. Ray Kelvin often hides his face in photographs Born in 1955 in north London Started work in uncle's shop aged 11 Founded first store in Glasgow in 1988 Expanded to Manchester and Nottingham, then to London in 1990 Married twice Awarded CBE in 2011 Ted Baker's acting chief executive Lindsay Page will continue in the role and the board has asked David Bernstein to act as executive chairman to provide additional support. Mr Bernstein has indicated that he will continue in this position until no later than 30 November 2020, by which time a successor will be appointed. In a statement, Mr Bernstein said:,external""As founder and CEO, we are grateful for his [Ray Kelvin's] tireless energy and vision. ""However, in light of the allegations made against him, Ray has decided that it is in the best interests of the company for him to resign so that the business can move forward under new leadership."" Mr Kelvin's statement said: ""Difficult though this decision is given that Ted Baker has been my life and soul for over 30 years, I've decided that the right thing to do is to step away from Ted and allow the business to focus on being the outstanding brand it is so it can face 2019 with fresh energy and renewed spirit. ""As a shareholder in the business I'll support Lindsay in his leadership and be available to him and the team wherever I can offer helpful advice. ""I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved in building Ted Baker to the global brand it is today. Thank you to every single colleague, customer, supplier, and investor for your commitment to the business. We couldn't have done it without you and I'm so grateful. Stockbrokers Liberum said Mr Kelvin's resignation was helpful to the company, describing his departure as ""unfortunate but understandable"". It added there would be minimal disruption to the business, which had ""a strong team"". Shares in Ted Baker fell 4% when trading began on Monday, but quickly rebounded. The company's shares had fallen sharply last week after it issued a profit warning, which it said was due to currency movements, product costs and a writedown on unsold stock.

Rosa met him in a London pub while she was a political activist in a group called Reclaim the Streets. The pair fell for each other quickly, to the extent that Rosa wanted to call the relationship off. Woman wants undercover officer prosecuted Police knew undercover officer was having sexual relationship Spy cops report 'will take eight years' Machynlleth woman on her life with undercover policeman ""It was too intense for meâ¦ I felt like I could forget to breathe. He seemed to be my life partner, he seemed to be some kind of blueprint I didn't even know I was looking for,"" she added. They were together for 10 months, but the man who called himself Jim Sutton was not who he claimed to be. He was an undercover policeman. Rosa said she and Jim were talking about having children, and moving to Wales, where she had family. Then Jim stunned her by saying he wanted to go travelling - on his own -  to ""sort his head out"". He left, saying his plan was to go to Turkey, Syria and then South Africa. After months missing, Jim got back in touch. Rosa started her own detective work, and could find no trace of the family he said he had. So she headed to South Africa, to find him. Jim Boyling, who used the name Jim Sutton while working as an undercover policeman ""I was walking round South Africa just saying 'excuse me have you seen this person?'. I was in torture, I needed answers."" She found no trace of him, and returned to the UK. Her search continued though, and clues led her to south London, and the offices of the secret police unit Jim worked for. Just two days later he re-appeared. ""I was in the fiction section - if you made a film out of this you'd say this is not realistic - and in he walked,"" she added. Rosa believes his reappearance was no coincidence. She believes she had triggered a response from the police and Jim had been sent to find out how much she knew. The encounter forced Jim to confess he had been living a lie. He was not Jim Sutton, he was police officer Jim Boyling. Rosa said he told her he actually empathised with activists like her and was not spying on them but was instead working on a separate, criminal investigation. She said this was another lie and said she was deceived for a second time - but that deception only came to light after she and Jim were married and had two children together. This video can not be played Two women had long-term relationships with men only to learn they were undercover officers Rosa said she was so damaged that she found it easy to believe Jim. ""The idea that my partner had never existed and was played by an actor, sent in by the state in order to spy on me as a peaceful green activist, was ludicrous and shook everything I believe in, so he was telling me stuff I knew, that I thought I knew,"" she added. There was no happy ending however. Rosa said Jim was controlling and manipulative - allegations he denies - and eventually she fled to a women's refuge in Wales and the couple divorced. Mark Stone and his partner of six years Lisa were on holiday in Italy in 2010 when she opened the glove compartment of his van looking for a pair of sunglasses. What she found inside would begin a process which dismantled undercover policing in the UK. It was a passport. The picture in it was the Mark she knew but the name next to it said his surname was Kennedy, not Stone. It also said he had children. Mark Kennedy with 'Lisa' during their relationship, when he called himself Mark Stone What Lisa did not know was that the man she knew as Mark Stone was an undercover policeman and had been paid to spy on her group of environmental activists. His covert deployment had just finished and he had handed back all his false documents - including his passport. It was a stroke of bad luck for him, and the Metropolitan Police, that she found the real one. Like Rosa, Lisa said the violation of trust by Mark and his employers feels like rape. ""It's been difficult for me to think of it in those words [rape] but I actually think that was what it was when it comes down to it. ""And the thing that also makes me feel even more violated, most violated, is that this deception, this relationship, this abuse wasn't just being perpetrated by one person. It wasn't just between myself and Mark, it was the whole police department."" Lisa, a committed environmental activist, met Mark in 2004. A willing participant in protests, he told her he was a professional climber. Although there were moments when Lisa had her suspicions, such as never meeting his parents, his stories about his difficult upbringing which left him with a frosty relationship with his family eased any concerns. On top of that, she was in love. ""He wasn't just somebody who was fleetingly in and out of my life. He was somebody I did everything with. I really did think we had a future together. This was somebody I was planning my life with,"" she said. In 2009, Mark suddenly left. He was gone for three months, with Lisa fearing he had had some sort of breakdown. Then, out of the blue, he returned. Their reunion led to the holiday in Italy, and the discovery of the fake passport. Undercover policeman Mark Kennedy on holiday with his partner Lisa and a friend began to investigate to find out who Mark really was and discovered he was married, had two children and lived in Ireland. Armed with this knowledge, Lisa and her fellow activists confronted Mark. In the face of the evidence, he had to admit who he really was. ""He was in tears and I was in tears,"" recalled Lisa. ""It was a hugely difficult and emotional evening. It's a very difficult memory to be thinking about."" The confirmation that Mark Kennedy was a police spy was the first step in the undercover policing network in England and Wales collapsing. Dozens of undercover officers were unmasked, and when it emerged that police had evenspied on the family of Stephen Lawrence, the teenager murdered in London in 1993, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - ordered apublic inquiry,external. The Metropolitan Police told BBC Wales Investigates: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has made clear its position on long-term, sexual relationships some undercover officers are known to have entered into with women in the past. These relationships were wrong and should not have happened. ""Undercover policing is a lawful and important tactic that takes dangerous offenders off the streets and helps protect communities, but cases such as these demonstrate that some officers abused their positions."" Policeman Mark Kennedy at the Glastonbury Festival during the time he was working undercover Mark Kennedy and Jim Boyling both declined interviews with BBC Wales Investigates. In a statement in April 2018, Jim said his relationship with Rosa was genuine, and did not come about because she was a person of interest to the police. ""I trust a more accurate picture of police covert operations may emerge from the Undercover Policing Inquiry, including perhaps the testimony of others who formed genuine relationships during the course of a deployment lasting several years,"" he said. Mark, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire in 2012, insisted his relationship with Lisa was built on genuine affection, and denied filing reports about her to the police. ""I know that the relationship we had - outside of what the names were - was probably one of the most loving experiences I've ever had,"" he said. In 2018 the Met admitted that Mark's handler and line manager knew about and approved himhaving a sexual relationship with another activist. Jim wassacked by the Metfor gross misconduct because of his relationship with Rosa. The disciplinary panel said: ""The system of control and governance over officers like DC Boyling was severely lacking."" But despite apologies from the police and compensation, Rosa and Lisa say their sense of betrayal remains. ""When people have had bereavement, you need to know what happened to a loved one before you can move on. In this case it almost feels as if there was a bereavement but I haven't just found out my partner has died, I found out he never existed in the first place,"" said Lisa.

"Young warned over buying drugs via appsA study says drug users have a ""false security"" of escaping law enforcement by using apps.Family & Education","Social media apps are increasingly likely to be used by young people to buy illegal drugs, research suggests. The study, from Royal Holloway, University of London, says drug users valued the convenience and speed of buying drugs via apps like Snapchat. It warns that buyers are at risk in terms of personal safety and drug quality and that many have a ""false security"" of escaping law enforcement. It says educating young people about the risks is ""crucial and urgent"". The study warns many are in denial about the risks: ""On the whole, app users had well-rehearsed narratives that justified their continued confidence in purchasing substances from unknown suppliers on apps."" Thestudy,external- #Drugsforsale: An exploration of the use of social media and encrypted messaging apps to supply and access drugs -  is based on an online survey of 358 users, 288 of whom had used apps to buy drugs and 70 who had thought about it. Most of these users were in the UK, Australia, Canada, and the US and the average age of the participants was 18. The researchers also conducted face-to-face interviews with 20 young people and in-depth interviews with a further 27. It found that while ""social supply"" of drugs through friends is still typically preferred, apps are ""fast becoming a viable option for accessing drugs"". Of the 358 online participants, 76% said they regularly used Snapchat, while 21% favoured Instagram. The study found that the convenience of organising a transaction was the most commonly reported advantage, with 79% giving this as a reason for using apps.

""Plenty of dealers in this area exist solely on Snapchat, so without it, I would've kept relying on people approaching me in the street or randomly bumping into people in clubs."" While 59% of these users valued the speed with which they could buy drugs, 35% liked the fact that apps offered access to substances they were previously unable to source.

Olly, 18, said: ""The first time I bought Xanax it was through Snapchat because I could watch the dealer opening sealed packets on his story before he sold them and I therefore felt safe consuming them."" The study raises a number of concerns about the safety of those who purchase drugs on these platforms. It also notes that many of the people think they will avoid law enforcement by buying drugs in this way. ""The key point is that many app users are misinformed, or make erroneous assumptions regarding the protections they offer.

Lead researcher Dr Leah Moyle from Royal Holloway, said: ""While our results show that buying from a known and trusted person is still the preferred access method for most drug users, it seems likely that app-usage will continue to grow in this market, especially among young people. ""Considering the popularity of apps and their potential to provide access to the wider commercial drug market, educating people of the possible risks of purchasing unknown substances from strangers on social media platforms is clearly both critical and urgent."" The paper is published in the International Journal of Drug Policy. A spokeswoman for Snapchat said: ""Accounts that use Snapchat to sell drugs are an intentional abuse of the terms of service and we remove these accounts when they are reported. ""We take our commitment to protecting Snapchatters from any misuse of our platform extremely seriously, and have partnered with best-in-class safety experts to inform our approach to these issues."" Instagram says that buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs on its platform is not allowed and the company encourages anyone who comes across content of this sort to report it.

Turtles and tortoises found wrapped in tape,"The reptiles, found in abandoned luggage, had been individually wrapped in tape Philippine police have seized more than 1,500 live turtles and tortoises found wrapped in duct tape at Manila airport. The reptiles, found in four unclaimed pieces of luggage, could have sold for more than 4.5 million pesos (Â£60,000; $86,631). Police believe the bags were abandoned after the carrier found out about the harsh penalties for illegal wildlife trafficking. If caught, they could face two years in jail and a fine of up to 200,000 pesos. A total of 1,529 turtles and tortoises of different species were found in four pieces of unclaimed luggage in the arrivals area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Sunday. Some of the animals were of the Sulcata Tortoise species - which are recognised as vulnerable on the IUCN's Red list of Threatened species. The Red-eared Slider turtle was also among the reptiles found. Turtles and tortoises are often kept as exotic pets, but are also eaten in parts of Asia The animals had been packed into boxes, then placed inside suitcases The Bureau of Customs said the reptiles were left behind by a Filipino passenger,externalwho was onboard a Philippine Airlines flight from Hong Kong. It said the passenger could have abandoned the luggage after they were ""informed of the vigilance... against illegal wildlife trade and its penalties"". The animals have now been handed over to the Wildlife Traffic Monitoring Unit. Turtles and tortoises are often kept as exotic pets, but are sometimes also used as a form of traditional medicine or served as a delicacy across parts of Asia. Their meat is considered by some to be an aphrodisiac, while the bones are powdered for use in medicine. Tortoises are land animals while turtles can be aquatic or terrestrial. Last week, 3,300 pig-nosed turtles were smuggled into Malaysia by boat - though this attempt was intercepted by Malaysia's maritime agency.

"Car buyers overcharged Â£1,000 for loans","Some car buyers are being overcharged by more than Â£1,000 when they take out a loan to buy a car, the UK's financial watchdog has warned. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the industry practice of allowing dealers to set their own interest rates was costing consumers Â£300m a year. Dealers overcharge to boost their commission, the FCA concluded. But the Finance and Leasing Association said the watchdog's survey was ""based largely on out-of-date information"". The regulator launched its investigation into the car finance market in April 2017 after there was a rapid surge in consumer credit led by car dealership finance. At the time, it said it was concerned about a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest. In its final findings on motor finance,external, the FCA concluded that the widespread use of commission models, which allow brokers discretion to set the customer's interest rate and thus earn higher commission, can lead to conflicts of interest that are not controlled adequately by lenders. It said the practice can lead to customers paying significantly more for their motor finance. Do new car finance deals spell trouble? Car and house insurance faces price probe Car sales see biggest fall since 2008 Jonathan Davidson of the FCA said: ""We found that some motor dealers are overcharging unsuspecting customers over a thousand pounds in interest charges in order to obtain bigger commission payouts for themselves. ""We also have concerns that firms may be failing to meet their existing obligations in relation to pre-contract disclosure and explanations, and affordability assessments. ""This is simply not good enough and we expect firms to review their operations to address our concerns."" Four-fifths of new car finance deals are now what are known as Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP. Instead of buying a car outright, a PCP allows consumers to effectively rent a car over a three or four-year period. At the end of the period consumers can buy the car for its residual value (known as a ""balloon"" payment), hand the car back, or roll over the residual value into a new PCP on a new vehicle. But problems have arisen because lenders have allowed brokers to set interest rates on the PCP agreements. The FCA estimated that on a typical motor finance agreement of Â£10,000, higher broker commission can result in the customer paying around Â£1,100 more in interest charges over a four-year term of an agreement. The FCA said it was assessing the options for intervening in the market. Options include strengthening existing rules or other steps such as banning certain types of commission model or limiting broker discretion. In the meantime, the regulator said it would deal with individual firms where problems were identified, but it expects all lenders and brokers to review the way they do business to make sure they comply with the law and treat customers fairly. The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a UK trade body for asset finance, consumer finance and motor finance, said that the FCA's survey work was ""based largely on out-of-date information, and therefore does not reflect the very considerable progress the market has already made in moving away from such structures"". The FCA analysed contracts between lenders and dealers from 2013 to 2016 and examined lenders' data from January 2017 to July 2018. The FLA added: ""We look forward to working with the FCA as it modernises its regulations in line with market best practice.""

"Ted Baker founder quits amid hugging rowRay Kelvin resigns after allegations of misconduct - including ""forced hugging"" - which he denies.Business","Ray Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988 The founder and chief executive of fashion chain Ted Baker, Ray Kelvin, has resigned following allegations of misconduct, including ""forced hugging"". Mr Kelvin had been on a voluntary leave of absence since December last year following the misconduct allegations. These, which Mr Kelvin denies, are being investigated by the company. In a statement, Mr Kelvin said the company had been his ""life and soul"" but ""the right thing to do is to step away from Ted"". He said the past few months had been ""deeply distressing"" but he would support the team wherever he could offer ""helpful advice"". Mr Kelvin, who owns 35% of the company, will not receive any severance pay, and any bonus payments he has earned for the past three years' performance will lapse. In December, employees launched anonline petition accusing him of inappropriatecomments and behaviour. Ted Baker boss ""made us hug and slow dance"" Ted Baker shares tumble after profit warning Ted Baker boss takes leave of absence The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin said that it was ""only right"" that Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate. Mr Kelvin founded Ted Baker in 1988. It now has around 500 outlets in the UK and overseas. Ray Kelvin often hides his face in photographs Born in 1955 in north London Started work in uncle's shop aged 11 Founded first store in Glasgow in 1988 Expanded to Manchester and Nottingham, then to London in 1990 Married twice Awarded CBE in 2011 Ted Baker's acting chief executive Lindsay Page will continue in the role and the board has asked David Bernstein to act as executive chairman to provide additional support. Mr Bernstein has indicated that he will continue in this position until no later than 30 November 2020, by which time a successor will be appointed. In a statement, Mr Bernstein said:,external""As founder and CEO, we are grateful for his [Ray Kelvin's] tireless energy and vision. ""However, in light of the allegations made against him, Ray has decided that it is in the best interests of the company for him to resign so that the business can move forward under new leadership."" Mr Kelvin's statement said: ""Difficult though this decision is given that Ted Baker has been my life and soul for over 30 years, I've decided that the right thing to do is to step away from Ted and allow the business to focus on being the outstanding brand it is so it can face 2019 with fresh energy and renewed spirit. ""As a shareholder in the business I'll support Lindsay in his leadership and be available to him and the team wherever I can offer helpful advice. ""I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved in building Ted Baker to the global brand it is today. Thank you to every single colleague, customer, supplier, and investor for your commitment to the business. We couldn't have done it without you and I'm so grateful. Stockbrokers Liberum said Mr Kelvin's resignation was helpful to the company, describing his departure as ""unfortunate but understandable"". It added there would be minimal disruption to the business, which had ""a strong team"". Shares in Ted Baker fell 4% when trading began on Monday, but quickly rebounded. The company's shares had fallen sharply last week after it issued a profit warning, which it said was due to currency movements, product costs and a writedown on unsold stock. It said full-year profit for the year to 26 January would be about Â£63m, compared with forecasts of Â£73.8m. The firm's shares were also hit late last year by the hugging controversy.

Orders gagging workers to be curbed,"Workers who sign gagging orders in return for pay-offs from their firms will still be able to report wrongdoing to the police under new proposals. The government has said it will bring in legal measures to protect workers from the misuse of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). It wants to enshrine in law that people cannot be prevented from reporting crimes, harassment or discrimination. Topshop boss Sir Philip Green has been at the centre of controversy over NDAs. It emerged in October last year that the businessman had used them to buy the silence of at least five members of staff who accused him of sexual and racial harassment. What are non-disclosure agreements? Last month,Sir Philip abandoned legal action against the Daily Telegraphnewspaper, which had first reported the allegations against him. The government's measures, announced by Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst, also include extending the law to ensure that workers agreeing to NDAs receive independent advice on their limitations. ""Many businesses use Non-Disclosure Agreements and other confidentiality agreements for legitimate business reasons, such as to protect confidential information,"" said Ms Tolhurst. ""What is completely unacceptable is the misuse of these agreements to silence victims, and there is increasing evidence that this is becoming more widespread. ""Our new proposals will help to tackle this problem by making it clear in law that victims cannot be prevented from speaking to the police or reporting a crime and clarifying their rights.""

"Police find 1,500 turtles wrapped in tape","The reptiles, found in abandoned luggage, had been individually wrapped in tape Philippine police have seized more than 1,500 live turtles and tortoises found wrapped in duct tape at Manila airport. The reptiles, found in four unclaimed pieces of luggage, could have sold for more than 4.5 million pesos (Â£60,000; $86,631). Police believe the bags were abandoned after the carrier found out about the harsh penalties for illegal wildlife trafficking. If caught, they could face two years in jail and a fine of up to 200,000 pesos. A total of 1,529 turtles and tortoises of different species were found in four pieces of unclaimed luggage in the arrivals area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Sunday. Some of the animals were of the Sulcata Tortoise species - which are recognised as vulnerable on the IUCN's Red list of Threatened species. The Red-eared Slider turtle was also among the reptiles found. Turtles and tortoises are often kept as exotic pets, but are also eaten in parts of Asia The animals had been packed into boxes, then placed inside suitcases The Bureau of Customs said the reptiles were left behind by a Filipino passenger,externalwho was onboard a Philippine Airlines flight from Hong Kong. It said the passenger could have abandoned the luggage after they were ""informed of the vigilance... against illegal wildlife trade and its penalties"". The animals have now been handed over to the Wildlife Traffic Monitoring Unit. Turtles and tortoises are often kept as exotic pets, but are sometimes also used as a form of traditional medicine or served as a delicacy across parts of Asia. Their meat is considered by some to be an aphrodisiac, while the bones are powdered for use in medicine. Tortoises are land animals while turtles can be aquatic or terrestrial. Last week, 3,300 pig-nosed turtles were smuggled into Malaysia by boat - though this attempt was intercepted by Malaysia's maritime agency.

"Save UK language skills, say MPs and peersDecline in language learning is ""a disaster for the country"", says a parliamentary group.Family & Education","Schools should teach a language to pupils from age five to 18 to reverse a ""disastrous"" decline in language skills, say MPs and peers. It follows aBBC investigationshowing falls of between 30 and 50% since 2013 in the numbers taking language GCSEs in some areas of England. Head teachers warned the aim might not be realistic because of teacher shortages and funding pressures. Ministers said the picture in England had improved slightly since 2010. This improvement in the overall proportion taking a language GCSE, thanks largely to Spanish and Mandarin, hides a collapse in numbers studying German and French. Between 2010 and 2018 in England, the numbers of German GCSEs fell from 57,806 to 39,941 and at A-level from 5,055 to 2,785, according to the Department for Education. The all-party parliamentary group on modern languages called for cross-government action in a recovery plan published on Monday. Jean Coussins, a crossbench peer and joint chair of the group, said: ""We are complacent.  In the 21st Century speaking only English, is as much of a disadvantage as speaking no English at all."" The report pointed towards a declining proportion of online content in English, and said that according to the British Council, 75% of the world's population does not speak English. The group is calling for a range of new qualifications, amid concerns that it is seen as harder to get a good grade in GCSEs than other subjects. ""One of myths we need to bust is [that] languages are just for the top set,"" said Baroness Coussins, pointing out that in a number of other countries the expectation is that everyone can learn another language. But Geoff Barton, from the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while head teachers supported the ambition to encourage language learning, it was important to be realistic. He said given funding constraints and the difficulty in recruiting specialist teachers, ""it is hard to see how schools could fulfil an objective to ensure all young people learn a language from ages five to 18"".

Baroness Coussins said: ""We're at a crunch point. When we're faced with the practical challenge of negotiating dozens of new free trade agreements, we'll discover speaking English is not enough."" That call was backed by Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He said: ""Language skills lead to a better understanding of how people and cultures operate, and that understanding is often the key to closing a business deal."" The German Ambassador to the UK, Peter Wittig, expressed hisdismay in a tweet,externalfollowing the BBC's report last week. In response to the parliamentary recovery plan Mr Wittig told the BBC that the decline in Britons learning German was ""deeply worrying"". He added: ""Speaking languages and engaging with other cultures are the currency of the 21st century. ""In today's inter-connected world, communicators and bridge-builders are needed as never before."" The German ambassador said not only did learning a language open doors in fields from finance to engineering, but it ""encourages friendship, trust and understanding across borders"".

Juan GuaidÃÂ³ to return to Venezuela,"Juan GuaidÃ³ called for mass protests as he announced his return to Venezuela Venezuela's self-proclaimed interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ says he is on his way back to Venezuela despite the risk of being arrested upon arrival. In a recording posted on his Twitter account, he said:,external""Venezuelan brothers and sisters, the moment you hear this message I will be on my way back home."" He also called on Venezuelans to join anti-government protests planned for Monday and Tuesday. Mr GuaidÃ³ has called on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to resign. The two men have been at loggerheads for more than a month. While Mr GuaidÃ³ has been recognised by more than 50 countries, Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president. After Mr GuaidÃ³ proclaimed himself interim president on 23 January, Venezuela's Supreme Court - which is dominated by loyalists of President Maduro - placed a travel ban on the opposition leader. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts What next for Venezuelaâs opposition? The country that has lost three million people Mr GuaidÃ³ defied that to attend a fund-raising concert in Colombia on 22 February organised by billionaire Richard Branson. Mr GuaidÃ³ crossed into Colombia, where he met the Chilean, Colombian and Paraguayan presidents Mr GuaidÃ³ also led efforts to try to bring humanitarian aid, mainly donated by the US, into Venezuela. The government of Mr Maduro rejected the aid, arguing it was part of a US plot to overthrow him. Genuine help or Trojan horse? The president ordered the closure of borders with Colombia and Brazil. Soldiers blocked the aid trucks, leading to clashes that left at least five dead. This video can not be played Venezuelan lawmakers clashed with soldiers The Maduro government alleged - without giving any evidence - that the aid was contaminated and carcinogenic. It is not clear. He had left by secretly sneaking across the Venezuela-Colombia border, reportedly with the help of sympathetic Venezuelan soldiers. More than 500 Venezuelan soldiers have defected and crossed into Colombia Mr GuaidÃ³ could sneak back over the porous 2,200km (1,370 mile) border on one of the many paths used by smugglers. He could also go via Brazil or Guyana, which also share borders, mostly in deep jungle. In all three cases, he would face a long journey to Caracas. The other option, and the most confrontational one, would be to fly directly into Caracas. There are direct commercial flights from BogotÃ¡ and Panama City. Flouting the travel ban imposed by Venezuela's highest court is likely to get Mr GuaidÃ³ into trouble. President Maduro has hinted at such. ""He can't come and go, the justice system had banned him from leaving the country. I respect the laws,"" he told ABC last week. The Venezuelan government has in the past not been shy to arrest opposition leaders.Lawmaker Juan Requesens has been in jail since August over his alleged role in a drone attack on President Maduro. Others have left the country for fear of arrest. However,when the secret police arrested Mr GuaidÃ³ on 13 January, he was released after half an hour. Communications Minister Jorge RodrÃ­guez said that arrest was ""irregular"" and the agents involved were dismissed. Mr GuaidÃ³ appears willing to face the risk of arrest, saying: ""If the regime dares, of course, to kidnap us, it will be the last mistake they make."" He also tweeted [in Spanish] that he had left instructions for his international allies for ""a clear route to follow"" should he be detained,external. Threats have been made against Juan GuaidÃ³ and his family, the Lima Group says Arresting Mr GuaidÃ³ would cause a huge outcry. US National Security Adviser John Bolton wrote of a ""strong and significant response"" on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that any measure that would put at risk Mr Guaido's ""freedom, safety or personal integrity would represent a major escalation of tensions"". Diplomats from the Lima group, a bloc of 14 Western Hemisphere countries created to tackle the Venezuela crisis, said last week that ""serious and credible threats"" had been made against the life of Mr GuaidÃ³. It said ""any violent actions against GuaidÃ³, his wife, or family"" would be met by all ""legal and political mechanisms"". While international pressure on President Maduro has steadily increased, the Venezuelan leader has dismissed all calls for him to step down and denounced them as attempted coups d'Ã©tat. President Maduro says that he is facing ""imperialist aggression"" According to Colombian migration officials, more than 500 soldiers have deserted from the Venezuelan army over the past weeks. While this is a sign that lower-ranking soldiers are suffering the same hardships - shortages of food and medicine - as the general population and are willing to follow the more than three million people who have left Venezuela over the past years, there is no sign yet of a general switch in loyalty. Government loyalists also still control much of the judiciary and the National Constituent Assembly, a body Mr Maduro set up to bypass the opposition-controlled legislative. However, there are unconfirmed reports that Diosdado Cabello, the National Constituent Assembly head, sent his two children to Hong Kong, which the opposition thinks is a sign of growing nervousness. The government also appears to be feeling the sanctions imposed by the US. Reuters reported last week it had taken eight tonnes of gold from the Central Bank to sell abroad to raise badly needed cash.

The German Ambassador to the UK, Peter Wittig, expressed hisdismay in a tweet,externalfollowing the BBC's report last week. In response to the parliamentary recovery plan Mr Wittig told the BBC that the decline in Britons learning German was ""deeply worrying"". He added: ""Speaking languages and engaging with other cultures are the currency of the 21st century. ""In today's inter-connected world, communicators and bridge-builders are needed as never before."" The German ambassador said not only did learning a language open doors in fields from finance to engineering, but it ""encourages friendship, trust and understanding across borders"".

Illegal STI drugs 'sold to celebrities',"This video can not be played Secret filming shows a BBC reporter buying unlicensed medicines Unlicensed antibiotics are being advertised on social media as treatment for sexually transmitted infections and sold at the wrong dose. A BBC reporter was sold the drugs by a man who said he got them from his uncle's pharmacy overseas. The man, who fled when confronted, said he had several celebrity clients. Government medicine regulator Alastair Jeffrey said taking the pills was ""not a gamble I'd be willing to take"". Mr Jeffrey said there was a great deal of concern around selling ""an unlicensed medicine; you've no idea where it's come from"". ""You don't know how it's been manufactured; you don't know where it's been stored or transported; it may have been sitting in some cargo container in 40 degree heat that could have an impact on the active pharmaceutical ingredient."" A BBC Inside Out West Midlands reporter paid Â£15 for antibiotics to be posted to him after replying to one online advert, claiming to have contracted chlamydia. Some online adverts claim to offer treatments to combat sexually transmitted infections He also received a text message with instructions on how to take them: four white azithromycin tablets first followed by one green doxycycline tablet, twice a day for 10 days. Our reporter then asked to meet the salesman, called Anthony, claiming he had syphilis. In a cafe near Clapham Junction, Anthony handed over more tablets for Â£25, telling the undercover reporter to have ""lots of water, no alcohol whatsoever and do not participate in any sexual activity"". During a second meeting, where the reporter took along a colleague claiming to have genital herpes, the salesman handed over what he said was a 10-day treatment consisting of anti-viral drugs. When asked about the medicines dispensed Dr Suneeta Soni, of the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV, said the dosages were wrong, and some of the treatments were no longer used to treat the conditions because antibiotic resistance had made them ineffective. What to do if you get an STI Game-changer: 'I didn't know HIV drug existed' Reality Check: Are dating apps really behind syphilis rise? The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed the sale of all the tablets in question was illegal because the company which made them did not hold a UK licence. Dr Meg Boothby, a consultant in Sexual Health and HIV Medicine in Birmingham, urged people to seek professional medical advice if they thought they had a sexually transmitted infection. Dr Meg Boothby said clinics are available in retail settings and no one ""needs to know why you're there"" ""People shouldn't feel embarrassed because actually looking after your sexual health, actually deciding you want to get checked out and find out if you do have an infection or not, is a very responsible thing to do,"" she said.

Storm Freya's high winds hit the UK,"This video can not be played Helen Willetts: ""Still potential for hazardous travelling conditions"" Wind speeds in parts of the UK have reached 76mph as Storm Freya sweeps across the country. Fallen trees and power lines have been reported, while the Met Office issued a warning for injury and danger to life from flying debris. Some roads have also been closed due to flooding and homes left without power.

Struggling towns to get post-Brexit boost,"A Â£1.6bn government fund has been launched to boost less well-off towns in England after Brexit. The pot is split into Â£1bn, divided in England using a needs-based formula, and Â£600m communities can bid for. More than half of the money, to be spread over seven years, will go to the north of England and the Midlands. Labour called it a bribe to influence MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal and critics say it does not cover cuts to local authority funding. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there will be additional announcements ""in due course"" for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. No Welsh cash in Â£1.6bn post-Brexit fund Council spending cuts, in seven charts 'Worst yet to come' in council cuts Brexit: All you need to know In January, MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. To win another vote, which Mrs May has promised will be on or before 12 March, she could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, told the PM last month to ""show us the money"" with ""transformative investment"" in areas that voted to leave. The Labour MP, who backed Mrs May's Brexit deal at the first vote, denied it amounted to ""transactional politics"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: âObviously, I wouldnât turn down any moneyâ¦ but my vote is not for saleâ But John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the fund ""smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the money will be targeted on coastal communities, market towns, and de-industrialised towns, which meets the demands of some Labour MPs, who say regeneration funding tends to go to big cities. The funding will go to specific projects like a new university campus or railway station, our correspondent added. Dismissing the claim that the funding aimed to entice Labour MPs, Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire insisted the cash would be made available even if the withdrawal agreement was rejected and denied the funding was a bribe. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country."" He said the money would ""supplement the work of councils"" and could be ""transformative"" and was there ""to see that towns grow"". However, Labour MP Alex Sobel, of the cross-party People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, said it was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with the cost of leaving the EU. He said the annual loss to local economies would be more than enough to wipe out any potential return from this scheme. Theresa May, pictured with her husband Philip, has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March Labour's Ruth Smeeth, the MP for Leave-supporting Stoke-on-Trent, described the amount of money as ""extraordinarily pathetic"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, she said: ""If you're talking about national renewal, this is less money than is being taken out of my economy by the introduction of [new welfare system] universal credit over the next four years."" Labour and Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell said the announcement was a ""huge disappointment"", tweeting: ""The entire allocation for the West Midlands over four years is less than the total value of cuts faced by Stoke-on-Trent City Council alone over the same period."" Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, has described the funding as ""a shameless little bung."" She told BBC Radio 5 Live that Â£90m had been lost from her local council over nine years of austerity and the money was ""bobbins"" and was ""shameless and embarrassing"". And Labour's Rhondda MP Chris Bryant tweeted: ""And not a penny for Wales. The trouble with bribes is they embody injustice."" Welsh councils facing real-terms cuts Austerity blamed for children in care rise A really simple guide to all things Brexit But the prime minister insisted: ""Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change - that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control. ""These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them."" She said prosperity had been ""unfairly spread"" for ""too long"". By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson A month ago John Mann - who voted to leave the EU - told the BBC there was a ""good dialogue"" going on with the government. And he was hopeful Mrs May would come back with ""something significant"" for his, and other, areas outside London. He and a group of Labour MPs from Leave areas were demanding the protection of employment rights after Brexit - and assurances poorer areas wouldn't lose out when EU regional funding ended. The cash on offer from the government is equivalent to less than 2% of English local authority spending. Theresa May says she is simply making good a promise she made in her first speech as prime minister to help ""ordinary working class families"". But the Labour leadership see this as a ""bribe"" to tempt some of their own MPs to break ranks and back Mrs May's deal. The former Conservative, now Independent, MP Anna Soubry claims it's an attempt to buy votes. But the government insists the true beneficiaries will be residents of coastal and industrial communities who feel left behind. The Â£1.6bn Stronger Towns Fund will be broken down into Â£600m, which communities in any part of England can bid for, and Â£1bn allocated using a needs-based formula to the following areas: North-west England:Â£281m North-east England:Â£105m Yorkshire and the Humber:Â£197m West Midlands:Â£212m East Midlands:Â£110m South-west England:Â£33m South-east England:Â£37m East England:Â£25m ""The formula allocations are based on a combination of productivity, income, skills, deprivation metrics and proportion of the population living in towns,"" a department spokesperson said. ""This targets funding at those places with economies that are performing relatively less well to the England average."" London is not included in the list, but towns within Greater London can bid for a share of the Â£600m pot, the department spokesperson added. The government said communities would be able to draw up job-boosting plans for their town, with the support and advice of their Local Enterprise Partnerships. It added that it would also seek to ensure towns in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would benefit from the new funding.

I'm locked in my kitchenÃ¢ÂÂ","Landscape gardener Sam Bennett makes beautiful sculptures from raw materials he finds on beaches. Stones and driftwood are the foundations of his work near his home in Torquay, Devon. The 26-year-old started making the sculptures about 12 years ago while still at school. ""I never had an X-box and I am always happy when I'm outside,"" he says. ""I read some books about [British sculptor] Andy Goldsworthy and it just became a hobby. ""Growing up, I was infatuated by making a living from nature. ""Even when I was doing exams at school I still wanted to go to the beach and build something."" The tides may wash away his work but he says its ephemeral nature is key to why he does it. ""It's there for a moment and gone the next, I'm just moving nature around,"" he says of his art. ""I like that because if it's not perfect the tide will take it and I will try again tomorrow. ""And there's an element of excitement about seeing the tide coming in and in a couple of hours it has been destroyed."" Mr Bennett shares pictures of his beach art onInstagram,externaland fans of his work sometimes visit the beaches where he is working. They include children who cannot resist the temptation to knock the work over before the tide comes in. ""I would rather see the sea destroy it, but I would have done the same when I was kid"" he says. Mr Bennett has been working at some beach spots so long that he even remembers some of the pebbles. And he destroys his own sculptures before leaving if they are on a popular beach to avoid anyone being injured. ""Most of the places are so remote it's not a problem,"" he says. He is at the beach most days for several hours. ""Some people said I am ruining the beach but I'm not hurting anyone and I'm not littering and in a few hours it will be gone. ""I read the news and there's a lot of pain in the world. If I did not do what I do it would all get too much for me.

Juan GuaidÃ³ to return to Venezuela,"Juan GuaidÃ³ called for mass protests as he announced his return to Venezuela Venezuela's self-proclaimed interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ says he is on his way back to Venezuela despite the risk of being arrested upon arrival. In a recording posted on his Twitter account, he said:,external""Venezuelan brothers and sisters, the moment you hear this message I will be on my way back home."" He also called on Venezuelans to join anti-government protests planned for Monday and Tuesday. Mr GuaidÃ³ has called on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to resign. The two men have been at loggerheads for more than a month. While Mr GuaidÃ³ has been recognised by more than 50 countries, Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president. After Mr GuaidÃ³ proclaimed himself interim president on 23 January, Venezuela's Supreme Court - which is dominated by loyalists of President Maduro - placed a travel ban on the opposition leader. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts What next for Venezuelaâs opposition? The country that has lost three million people Mr GuaidÃ³ defied that to attend a fund-raising concert in Colombia on 22 February organised by billionaire Richard Branson. Mr GuaidÃ³ crossed into Colombia, where he met the Chilean, Colombian and Paraguayan presidents Mr GuaidÃ³ also led efforts to try to bring humanitarian aid, mainly donated by the US, into Venezuela. The government of Mr Maduro rejected the aid, arguing it was part of a US plot to overthrow him. Genuine help or Trojan horse? The president ordered the closure of borders with Colombia and Brazil. Soldiers blocked the aid trucks, leading to clashes that left at least five dead. This video can not be played Venezuelan lawmakers clashed with soldiers The Maduro government alleged - without giving any evidence - that the aid was contaminated and carcinogenic. It is not clear. He had left by secretly sneaking across the Venezuela-Colombia border, reportedly with the help of sympathetic Venezuelan soldiers. More than 500 Venezuelan soldiers have defected and crossed into Colombia Mr GuaidÃ³ could sneak back over the porous 2,200km (1,370 mile) border on one of the many paths used by smugglers. He could also go via Brazil or Guyana, which also share borders, mostly in deep jungle. In all three cases, he would face a long journey to Caracas. The other option, and the most confrontational one, would be to fly directly into Caracas. There are direct commercial flights from BogotÃ¡ and Panama City. Flouting the travel ban imposed by Venezuela's highest court is likely to get Mr GuaidÃ³ into trouble. President Maduro has hinted at such. ""He can't come and go, the justice system had banned him from leaving the country. I respect the laws,"" he told ABC last week. The Venezuelan government has in the past not been shy to arrest opposition leaders.Lawmaker Juan Requesens has been in jail since August over his alleged role in a drone attack on President Maduro. Others have left the country for fear of arrest. However,when the secret police arrested Mr GuaidÃ³ on 13 January, he was released after half an hour. Communications Minister Jorge RodrÃ­guez said that arrest was ""irregular"" and the agents involved were dismissed. Mr GuaidÃ³ appears willing to face the risk of arrest, saying: ""If the regime dares, of course, to kidnap us, it will be the last mistake they make."" He also tweeted [in Spanish] that he had left instructions for his international allies for ""a clear route to follow"" should he be detained,external. Threats have been made against Juan GuaidÃ³ and his family, the Lima Group says Arresting Mr GuaidÃ³ would cause a huge outcry. US National Security Adviser John Bolton wrote of a ""strong and significant response"" on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that any measure that would put at risk Mr Guaido's ""freedom, safety or personal integrity would represent a major escalation of tensions"". Diplomats from the Lima group, a bloc of 14 Western Hemisphere countries created to tackle the Venezuela crisis, said last week that ""serious and credible threats"" had been made against the life of Mr GuaidÃ³. It said ""any violent actions against GuaidÃ³, his wife, or family"" would be met by all ""legal and political mechanisms"". While international pressure on President Maduro has steadily increased, the Venezuelan leader has dismissed all calls for him to step down and denounced them as attempted coups d'Ã©tat. President Maduro says that he is facing ""imperialist aggression"" According to Colombian migration officials, more than 500 soldiers have deserted from the Venezuelan army over the past weeks. While this is a sign that lower-ranking soldiers are suffering the same hardships - shortages of food and medicine - as the general population and are willing to follow the more than three million people who have left Venezuela over the past years, there is no sign yet of a general switch in loyalty. Government loyalists also still control much of the judiciary and the National Constituent Assembly, a body Mr Maduro set up to bypass the opposition-controlled legislative. However, there are unconfirmed reports that Diosdado Cabello, the National Constituent Assembly head, sent his two children to Hong Kong, which the opposition thinks is a sign of growing nervousness. The government also appears to be feeling the sanctions imposed by the US.
