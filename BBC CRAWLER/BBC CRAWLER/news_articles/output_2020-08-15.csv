Why did the algorithm say no?,"A protest over A-level results gathered in Westminster Accusations of unfairness over this year's A-level results in England have focused on an ""algorithm"" for deciding results of exams cancelled by the pandemic. This makes it sound Machiavellian and complicated, when perhaps its problems are really being too simplistic. There have been two key pieces of information used to produce estimated grades: how students have been ranked in ability and how well their school or college has performed in exams in recent years. So the results were produced by combining the ranking of pupils with the share of grades expected in their school. There were other minor adjustments, but those were the shaping factors. Labour calls for teachers' predictions in A-levels Anger from head teachers over 'unfair' A-levels What's next in arguments over A-levels It meant that at a national level there would be continuity - with this year's estimated results effectively mirroring the positions of recent years. But it locks in all the advantages and disadvantages - and means that the talented outlier, such as the bright child in the low-achieving school, or the school that is rapidly improving, could be delivered an injustice. The independent schools and the high-achieving state schools with strongest track records of exams were always going to collect the winners' medals, because it was an action replay of the last few years' races. And those in struggling schools were going to see their potential grades capped once again by the underachievement of previous years. In Scotland the accusations of unfairness prompted a switch to using teachers' predicted grades. These predictions were collected in England too - but were discounted as being the deciding factor, because they were so generous that it would have meant a huge increase in top grades, up to 38%. Students have challenged the fairness of estimated grades There were also doubts about the consistency and fairness of predictions and whether the cautious and realistic could have lost out to the ambitiously optimistic. As a consequence, while teachers might have decided the ranking order of pupils, their predictions have mostly been sidelined. And the ""downgrading"" of almost 40% of results has reflected the lowering of teachers' predictions back to the levels that previous history suggests would have been achieved. There have been calls to use teachers' predicted grades instead If these predictions had not been gathered there would not have been any ""downgrading"" - and perhaps the stories would have been about the overall results being the highest ever - with more top grades than in almost 70 years of A-levels. Instead there has been uncertainty and distrust. What has troubled and angered schools has been that while the averages have been protected, individuals could be losing out. They say the lowering of grades seems sometimes inconsistent and unfair and they are frustrated at the inability to refine what has seemed a clumsy process. For instance, there was no direct connection between an individual's prior achievement and their predicted grade. So if someone got all top grades at GCSE and then moved to a low-performing school for A-level, they might find themselves locked out of getting the grades they might have got if they'd gone to a different high-achieving school. Schools working hard to make rapid improvements in tough circumstances feel themselves boxed in and that their young people have missed out on opportunities in university. The problems of social mobility and regional inequalities are not hard to see. But it's going to be harder to unpick what has happened. The appeals system could be swamped by angry schools and their pupils wanting to challenge results. Will there be whole-school changes to grades which were decided at a whole-school level? No one knows yet how appeals over mock exams might work. It was such a last-minute addition that it was announced before the regulator could decide any rules for it. The ""algorithm"" also suggests the sense of powerlessness felt by those students disappointed by their results. It was a ""computer says 'no'"" way of missing out. Now ministers and exam regulators will have to find a human way back.

'You've ruined my life',"This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" A student rejected by her chosen university after her A-levels were downgraded has told schools minister Nick Gibb, ""you've ruined my life"". Nina Bunting-Mitcham, speaking on the BBC's Any Questions, said her marks were three grades lower than predicted. And talking to the BBC on Saturday, she said that getting three Ds had made her feel like life ""was completely over"". The government says it will cover the cost of appeals after 280,000 grades in England were downgraded. With school exams cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's grades in England were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. In England,36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predictedand 3% were down two grades, prompting anger and distress among schools, colleges and students. Nina told the BBC her teachers were ""utterly shocked"" on learning her predicted results of ABB - in biology, chemistry and psychology - had plummeted. The pupil at New College, Stamford, confronted Nick Gibb on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday. ""It's got to be a mistake, I have never been a D-grade student,"" she told him. ""I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can't get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life."" ""You have ruined my life."" Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Responding to Nina, Mr Gibb said it was ""rare"" for students to be downgraded three grades, adding it ""should not have happened"". ""It won't ruin your life, it will be sorted, I can assure you."" He admitted to ""imperfections somewhere in the system"" and said challenged grades would be addressed ""swiftly"", by 7 September at the latest. Ministers are expected to set up a taskforce, led by Mr Gibb, to oversee the appeals process. Disappointed students protested in Westminster on Friday Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Nina said she felt ""encouraged"" by the minister's words, but believed his statement contradicted previous assurances by the government that the grading system was ""robust"". She said she had begun the appeals process, but it was still not clear whether revised grades would be based on mock exams or teachers' predictions - and the Royal Veterinary College would only keep her place open until 31 August. ""They [the government] need to believe in the teachers,"" she said. ""The teachers are professionals. They see students every day, they talk to them, they know them personally... They are the best people to predict the grades."" Why did the A-level algorithm say no? The Department of Education said it had introduced a ""triple lock system"", meaning those pupils ""unhappy with their calculated grades can appeal on the basis of a valid mock result"" or sit an exam in the autumn. The government also said it would reimburse the cost of an appeal - which can reach Â£150 - to ensure that head teachers were not deterred from taking on harder to prove cases. However, one head teacher told BBC Breakfast it was a ""token gesture"", adding that appeals were already free if they were successful. Meanwhile,Oxford's Worcester College said it would honour all offersit had made to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Admissions tutor Prof Laura Ashe said it was ""the morally right thing to do"". Because students had not taken any exams, ""we took the view there wasn't going to be any new information that could justify rejecting someone to whom we'd made an offer"", she said. She said the algorithm used to adjust grades ""literally copied the inequalities that are currently existing in our education system"", with a quarter of the college's state school applicants being downgraded, but only 10% of private school candidates. Ofqual adjusted the results to make the spread of grades look right at a national level, she said, but ""they can't possibly tell us that they've given the right grades to the right people"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he was ""fully prepared to take legal action"",  arguing that Ofqual's grading system was ""straightforwardly discriminatory"" against working class and ethnic minority students who are more likely to attend large, urban sixth form colleges. ""It discriminates against young people on the basis of the institution that they went to, rather than their ability."" ""I cannot stand by and see thousands of lives ruined across Greater Manchester,"" he told BBC Breakfast, calling the process ""fundamentally unfair"". He accused the government of being ""out of touch"" and called the grading system ""the single biggest act of levelling down that this country has ever seen"". There have been calls to move away from the system and use teachers' predictions - following aU-turn by the government in Scotland, where downgraded results have been replaced by the original teacher estimates. But England's exam watchdog, Ofqual, has warned that using teachers' predictions would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As in England. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has vowed there will be ""no U-turn"" while insisting his ""absolute priority is fairness"". Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Education Committee, joined opposition parties in expressing concernover what Labour termed an ""exams fiasco"". He called on Ofqual to publish details of the algorithm it used to make its calculations, adding: ""If the model has penalised disadvantaged groups, this is very serious.""

Free appeals for England schools,"There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results The government will cover the cost of schools in England appealing against exam grades after students had 280,000 A-level results downgraded. Ministers are also expected to set up a taskforce, led by Schools Minister Nick Gibb, to oversee the appeals process. The government previously said it wants the process to conclude by 7 September. But letting schools make appeals free of charge is ""cold comfort"" for pupils, the Liberal Democrats said, adding the move ""should never have been needed"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Times the government would cover the fees in a bid to ensure that head teachers were not deterred from making appeals. Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Anger over 'unfair' A-level results There had been fears that the costs - which can reach Â£150 - could stop schools from taking on harder to prove cases. The regulator, Ofqual, will give more details next week. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awardedon Thursday were lower than teachers' assessments, prompting anger among schools, colleges and students. Mr Gibb promised that the appeals system will be ""robust"" after facing a call during BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday from a student who said she had been rejected by her chosen university. Nina, from Peterborough, said her grades fell three grades lower than her teachers' estimates. She was expected to achieve ABB and scored As and Bs in her mock exams but was handed three D grades. She told Mr Gibb she was distraught after failing to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College. ""You have ruined my life,"" she told him. ""It won't ruin your life, it will be sorted, I can assure you,"" Mr Gibb said. He added: ""There will be these mistakesâ¦ we do know there are imperfections somewhere in the system as a result of this model. There are no models that can improve on that, this is the problem."" Samantha Smith, a grammar school student from Telford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her results had been downgraded from As and A* grades to a B, E and U. ""I know I didn't sit the exam but I didn't think I'd be treated as if I didn't turn up for the exam,"" she said. ""I've now got no university places, because of the algorithm and the system of being treated as if your postcode matters more than your potential."" Why did the A-level algorithm say no? While many students discovered they lost their university places,Oxford's Worcester College said it will honour all offersit made to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Admissions tutor Prof Laura Ashe said it was ""the morally right thing to do"". Because students had not taken any exams, ""we took the view there wasn't going to be any new information that could justify rejecting someone to whom we'd made an offer"", she said. She said the algorithm used to adjust grades ""literally copied the inequalities that are currently existing in our education system"", with a quarter of the college's state school applicants being downgraded, but only 10% of private school candidates. Ofqual adjusted the results to make the spread of grades look right at a national level, she said, but ""they can't possibly tell us that they've given the right grades to the right people"". The Liberal Democrats welcomed the announcement over appeals costs, but called on Mr Williamson to resign. The party's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: ""For the young people who have worked so hard to not get the results they deserve, through no fault of their own, this announcement alone will be cold comfort."" ""While this should never have been needed, it is right the government has listened to the Liberal Democrats and others and U-turned."" Ms Moran added: ""Ultimately, after Gavin Williamson's botched handling of the process thus far, pupils will have no confidence in him to fix the broken glass. Before he causes any more hurt, he must go."" Earlier, Labour called on ministers to act immediately to sort out an ""exams fiasco"" in England and stop thousands of A-level students being ""betrayed"". And some Tory MPs have challenged the fairness of how grades have been decided. BBC News political correspondent Helen Catt said having ""an efficient and effective"" appeals process ""is going to be really important in making sure more Tories don't join them"". After exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than have ever been seen before in A-levels, with almost 28% getting A* and As, but head teachers have been angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading of some results. In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades. There has since been calls to switch away from this system and to use teachers' predictions, in the way that the government U-turned in Scotland. But England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' predictions would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As. Labour said the lack of consistency in individual results was ""heartbreaking"" for those affected and the government was squarely to blame for sticking with a ""fatally flawed results system"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously defended what he said were a ""robust set"" of grades and said that pupils who believed they were treated unfairly would be able to appeal or, if they wanted, sit exams in the autumn. Schools can appeal for an upgrade if their pupils' mock grades were higher than their estimated results. But the exam regulator Ofqual has still to say how a mock exam result can be validated - and head teachers have warned that mocks are not standardised or taken by all pupils, and could not be used as a fair way of deciding final exam results.

UK marks 75th anniversary of VJ Day,"This video can not be played A service of remembrance was held at the National Memorial Arboretum The Royal Family has led the UK's commemorations on the 75th anniversary of VJ Day - the day World War Two ended with Japan's surrender. The Prince of Wales led a two-minute silence at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, as part of a service of remembrance. Later, in a TV address, his elder son Prince William urged the public ""to learn the lessons of the past"". And a message from the Queen thanked those ""who fought so valiantly"". She said: ""Those of us who remember the conclusion of the Far East campaign, whether on active service overseas, or waiting for news at home, will never forget the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief."" The Prince of Wales attended the event at the arboretum with the Duchess of Cornwall. He laid a wreath at the Kwai Railway Memorial, as a small number of veterans and their relatives sat on benches dotted around the garden, to maintain social distancing. A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast also commemorated those who fought. In a speech, Prince Charles said the veterans' service ""will echo through the ages."" He referred to the description of them as the Forgotten Army, noting how many soldiers, nurses and other personnel felt aggrieved at the way some of the public associated the end of World War Two with the victory in Europe in May 1945. ""Let us affirm, they and serving veterans are not forgotten, rather you are respected, thanked and cherished with all our hearts and for all time,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who also attended and read the poem The Exhortation before the silence, thanked those who had fought for restoring ""peace and prosperity"". Boris Johnson laid a wreath and read the war poem Exhortation - saying ""they shall grow not old"" This video can not be played Prince William: ""Your bravery, and the sacrifices you made, will never be forgotten"" In a pre-recorded speech for BBC One's VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute - broadcast on Saturday evening - the Duke of Cambridge spoke of how King George VI addressed the nation on August 15 1945 as ""the most catastrophic conflict in mankind's history came to an end"". ""It is hard for us to imagine what Victory over Japan Day must have felt like at the time; a mix of happiness, jubilation, and sheer relief, together with a deep sadness and overwhelming sense of loss for those who would never return home. ""Today we remember those who endured terrible suffering and honour all those who lost their lives."" He cautioned: ""As we look back, we must not forget our responsibility to learn the lessons of the past and ensure that the horrors of the Second World War are never repeated. ""We owe that to our veterans, to their families, and to the generations who will come after us. He went on to thank those veterans, among them his own grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who ""remembers vividly his role in collecting released prisoners of war"", said Prince William. Prince Philip was a young Royal Navy officer aboard a warship in Tokyo Bay when Japan surrendered. As part of the commemorations, he appeared in a photo montage of veterans which featured on large screens in locations across the country throughout the day. In the montage each veteran was pictured with an image of themselves from their time in service. It marked a rare appearance for Prince Philip, 99, who has only been seen a handful of times in public since retiring in 2017 - most recently for a military event at Windsor Castle. Earlier in the morning, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was joined by military chiefs as he placed a wreath at the Cenotaph in London. The defence secretary also met some of the famous Chelsea Pensioners during his visit to their iconic home, the Royal Hospital Chelsea, as part of events to mark the 75th anniversary. But the Red Arrows - who were due to carry out a flypast over the capital cities of all four nations of the UK - were forced to cancel flights over Edinburgh, Cardiff and London, where they were to fly directly over the Royal Hospital Chelsea, due to poor weather conditions. They were, at least, able to fly over Belfast, and pilots met three veterans during a stop at Prestwick, near Glasgow. The Red Arrows flew over the Titanic slipway and the Titanic Museum in Belfast VJ Day - or Victory over Japan Day - on 15 August 1945 ended one of the worst episodes in British military history, during which tens of thousands of servicemen were forced to endure the brutalities of prisoner of war camps. It is estimated that there were 71,000 British and Commonwealth casualties of the war against Japan, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war who died in Japanese captivity. More than 2.5 million Japanese military personnel and civilians are believed to have died over the course of the conflict. What is VJ Day? VJ Day celebrations 75 years ago Bells toll to mark 75 years since Hiroshima bomb The fighting in Europe had ended in May 1945, but many Allied servicemen were still fighting against Japan in east Asia. Japan rejected an ultimatum for peace, and the US believed that dropping a nuclear bomb would force them to surrender. The US dropped two atomic bombs on Japan on 6 and 9 August, killing an estimated 214,000 people, and within two weeks Japan surrendered. To mark the 75th anniversary,Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offeringto a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, but did not attend in person. However, two of his ministers did visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in which 14 leaders who were later convicted by the Allies as war criminals are commemorated. John Maguire, BBC News The National Memorial Arboretum seems to lend itself perfectly to the concept of a socially distanced commemorative service. Veterans of the Burma campaign, their families, and other guests sat on chairs spaced out on the grass between the trees. The proceedings focused on the multinational and multicultural make up of the Allied forces that fought the Japanese. Gurkhas, alongside Sikhs, sat next to troops from Welsh and Scottish regiments, representing the 40 nations involved in the Far East. After sitar music, readings from British Asian actors, and speeches from descendants of those who fought, the roar of aircraft engines could be heard overhead. A Lancaster, Hurricane and three Spitfires from the Battle of Britain Memorial flew over in formation and in tribute. Then those who could stand, were invited to do so for a two-minute silence. The Prince of Wales then laid a wreath at the Burma Railway Memorial. Flowers had been placed between the sleepers and track that make up the memorial. It was known as the ""Death Railway"" and 16,000 prisoners of war died during its construction. It makes an incongruous, yet incredibly poignant sight among the granite and brass of the other memorials. Boris Johnson earlier joined other world leaders including US President Donald Trump in recording a video message to thank veterans. In the video, each leader says in turn: ""To all who served, we thank you."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (far right) laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning Mr Johnson added: ""On this 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, we pay tribute to the heroes deployed thousands of miles away in the mountains, islands and rainforests of Asia. ""Unable to celebrate the victory in Europe, and among the last to return home, today we recognise the bravery and ingenuity of those who, in the face of adversity, restored peace and prosperity to the world. ""Their immeasurable sacrifice changed the course of history and, at today's commemorations, we take the opportunity to say what should be said every day - thank you."" How a Belfast doctor used Irish to keep WW2 secrets A WW2 hero and a reckoning with Japan's past Daughter of WW2 prisoner of war shares last letter In a letter specifically addressed to Far East veterans, Mr Johnson said: ""You were the last to come home but your achievements are written in the lights of the glittering capitals of the dynamic region we see today."" ""All of us who were born after you have benefitted from your courage in adversity. On this anniversary, and every day hereafter, you will be remembered,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also recorded a message, paying tribute ""to the wartime generation, who through the horrors of conflict showed us the spirit and determination that we need to always remember and always be grateful for"". ""It's important that as we face the challenges of today, we take inspiration from that generation,"" he said. At the 70th anniversary of VJ Day there was a parade in London Meanwhile Capt Sir Tom Moore, who served in the Burma campaign has encouraged the public to join in the commemorations, describing VJ Day as ""the most special day"". ""It was VJ Day when the pain of war could finally start to fall away as peace was declared on all fronts,"" said Sir Tom - who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden during lockdown. ""I respectfully ask Britain to stop whatever it is doing and take some time to remember. ""We must all take the time to stop, think and be thankful that were it not for the ultimate sacrifices made all those years ago by such a brave band of men and women, we would not be enjoying the freedoms we have today, even in these current difficult times."" The service at the National Memorial Arboretum was broadcast on BBC One between 09:30 and 11:30 BST and is available on Iplayer. VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute is broadcast from 20:30 BST.

Ofqual 'reviewing' exam appeals guidance,"The exams regulator is reviewing its guidance on how to appeal against A-level and GCSE grades using mock exam results - hours after publishing it. On Saturday Ofqualset out what constituted a ""valid"" mock exam for students appealing against A-level results in England. But the regulator has now suspended those criteria, and further information will be published ""in due course"". One Tory MP described it as a ""huge mess"" that was ""unacceptable"". A Department for Education statement on Sunday evening said that Ofqual ""continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need"". The statement added that it had been working with Ofqual to achieve an appeals process that was as fair as possible. Neither A-level nor GCSE students were able to sit public exams this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and almost 40% of A-level grades weremarked down from teachers' predictionsby an Ofqual algorithm. The Conservative chairman of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, said the decision to review appeals guidance only announced on Saturday left students and schools in confusion. ""That is a huge mess. Goodness knows what is going on at Ofqual. It is the last thing we need at this time. This is just unacceptable in my view,"" he said. ""Students and teachers are incredibly anxious - particularly the students who are worried about their future. This has got to be sorted out. ""Ofqual shouldn't put things on websites, take them away, sow confusion. This is just not on and it has got to be changed."" Meanwhile, the statistical model used by Ofqual to determine grades faces two legal challenges, which argue students were unfairly judged on the school they attend. Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life' Free exam appeals for schools in England Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said earlier on Saturday that, where a written mock exam was not taken, it would consider other teacher assessments instead. However, a statement published late on Saturday night on the regulator's website read: ""Earlier today we published information about mock exam results in appeals. ""This policy is being reviewed by the Ofqual Board and further information will be published in due course."" Hundreds of students have held a demonstration in central London, demanding clarity over the appeals procedure. This video can not be played Demonstrating students said they feel ""very let down"" and that the grading is unfair Holding placards - many of which called for the education secretary's resignation - they made their way through Westminster to the Department for Education. Dozens of protesters sat on the front steps while others shouted ""come out Gavin"" and ""justice for the working class"". Many of the demonstrators have called the downgrading of results ""classist"". ""Baffling, mind-boggling, inadequate, shell-shocked"" - these are the politer responses from school leaders, trying to make sense of Ofqual's bizarre retraction of its own rules over A-level appeals. An early morning email from an otherwise respectable head teacher was titled: ""WTF?"" Ofqual is meant to be an independent exams watchdog, but assuming it didn't overrule itself, who did pull the plug on what they'd announced for appeals over mock exams? The non-decision still leaves students anxiously waiting to find out if they can appeal and claim their university places. There is also irritation that ministers didn't head off this chaos in advance, or even when problems emerged in Scotland. In the end, whether it's by Ofqual or the Department for Education or Number 10, a decision will have to be made. Do they stick with the current grades and retro-fit them with a functioning appeals system? And will that withstand the unpicking of the fairness of results and legal challenges? Or do they take the political hit - and the risk of creating other types of unfairness - by switching to teachers' predictions, as eventually happened in Scotland? For ministers, it's time to turn over the exam paper and start their answers. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the Department for Education appeared to be unaware of the change and the review of the criteria was likely to draw further criticism of the government's handling of the exams process in England. The criteria under which Ofqual would accept a ""valid mock assessment"", set out on Saturday and then suspended hours later, had been stipulated as: Supervised, unseen and undertaken in conditions intended to secure the work as the student's own Either past assessments produced by the relevant exam board, or assessments developed by teachers Taken under timed conditions Completed before 20 March 2020, when schools and colleges were closed Marked using a mark scheme provided by the relevant exam board Graded in line with the exam board's examination standard Before results were released, the Department for Education announced a ""triple-lock"", which meant that students could accept the grade calculated by Ofqual, appeal to receive a ""valid mock result"" or sit autumn exams. However, Labour said that, under the new Ofqual criteria, some students would not be able to use their mock results as the basis for an appeal. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had presided over a ""complete and utter fiasco"" and the prime minister was ""watching from the sidelines while a generation of young people are being robbed of their future"". ""No student should be worse off because of government failure,"" she said. The government should return to teacher assessments and take ""urgent action"" to avoid repeating the issue with GCSEs on Thursday, Ms Rayner said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson had been ""invisible"" during the results period. ""He needs to take personal responsibility and fix it,"" he said. Ofqual also faces two judicial review cases, with students challenging what they say is an ""irrational, arbitrary"" approach. Student Curtis Parfitt-Ford was awarded his predicted grades but told the BBC he wants to challenge the ""completely ridiculous"" system. Student Curtis Parfitt-Ford intends to challenge Ofqual in the courts He said his lawyers, from Leigh Day and Foxglove, believe Ofqual acted outside its statutory responsibilities in basing judgements on schools' prior performance not ""individual achievement and attainment"". Six students are also being supported by campaigning legal group the Good Law Project. One of the pupils, named only as Michael, saw his grades fall from a predicted three Bs to three E grades. ""It is abysmal to think that the government, whose job it is to lead this country in the right direction, has allowed an algorithm to determine the futures of thousands of students,"" he said. Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Labour call for urgent U-turn over 'exams fiasco' Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Breakfast that way results have been handled this year is ""simply not good enough"". He added that universities needed to stop being ""insular and self-protective"" and to ""step up"", offering places to disadvantaged students who had been downgraded. This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" He also called for Ofqual to re-examine extreme cases, such as students downgraded from a teacher-assessed C to a failing U grade. ""Young people, after two years on a course, should really not be coming out with a fail when they haven't had the chance to sit the exam,"" Mr Barton said. He said the ""really big issue"" is what has gone wrong with the statistical model used to determine results and how it might affect GCSEs, where there are larger numbers of disadvantaged students waiting for grades. The government announced on Friday thatschools would not have to pay to appeal against exam grades. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat? FORT SALEM:Fancy some escapism?

Japan marks 75 years since WWII,"Emperor Naruhito spoke at a memorial event in Tokyo on Saturday Japan's Emperor Naruhito has expressed ""deep remorse"" over his country's actions during World War Two, on the 75th anniversary of its surrender. ""I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never again be repeated,"" he said at a ceremony on Saturday. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised to ""never repeat the tragedy"". The PM marked the occasion by sending an offering to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, but did not visit in person. However, four ministers did visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in a move that is likely to anger China and South Korea. VJ Day celebrations 75 years ago A WW2 hero and a reckoning with Japan's past How a Belfast doctor used Irish to keep WW2 secrets It is the first time in four years such senior politicians have attended the shrine, which pays homage to a number of senior figures convicted of war crimes as well as the country's war dead. ""I paid respects... to the souls of those who nobly sacrificed themselves during the war,"" Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda explained to reporters. Social distancing measures were in place at the Yasukuni Shrine because of the Covid-19 pandemic Emperor Naruhito delivered a short speech at a memorial service in Tokyo, which was scaled back due to the coronavirus pandemic. About 500 people were in attendance compared to more than 6,000 last year and face masks were compulsory. ""Looking back on the long period of post-war peace, reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never again be repeated,"" he said at the event. Naruhito, 60, began his reign in May last year after his father, Emperor Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate the throne in more than 200 years. The memorial event on Saturday was scaled back because of coronavirus South Korea's President Moon Jae-in did not mention the controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in remarks made on Saturday. President Moon instead used the occasion - known as Liberation Day in South Korea - to say his government was prepared to sit down for face to face talks over historical disputes at any time. Seoul and Tokyo are divided over compensation demands for Koreans forced to work under the Japanese occupation, which began in 1910 and ended in 1945. Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine is home to the spirits of Japan's 2.5 million war dead. This morning, despite 36 degree heat and Covid-19, thousands of ordinary people lined up to pay their respects. But the Yasukuni Shrine also honours 14 of Japan's wartime leaders, men who were later convicted as class A war criminals. Any visit to the shrine by a senior Japanese politician is considered highly offensive in Korea and China. This video can not be played Shinzo Abe's visit will make relations with China worse, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes For that reason, Japan's emperor never visits the shrine, and today's official commemorations are being held elsewhere. But four senior members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet did go to Yasukuni this morning, and Mr Abe himself sent a ritual offering. That will reinforce the view in Beijing and Seoul that 75 years after the war ended, Japan's ruling elite is still less than sincere in its remorse for this country's wartime aggression. Japan entered World War Two in September 1940. It drew the US into the war at the end of 1941, after attacking its naval base at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. By the end of the war more than 100,000 Americans and 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war, had died in the Pacific. Millions more died during the Japanese occupation of China and South Korea. Victory in Europe (VE) Day took place on 8 May 1945 following Germany's surrender, but the war continued in the Asia-Pacific region for months. Bells toll to mark 75 years since Hiroshima bomb The day Michiko nearly missed her train Following the end of the fighting in Europe, the Allies told Japan to surrender on 26 July 1945, but the deadline passed without them doing this. The war was brought to an end shortly after the US dropped nuclear bombs over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945. On 15 August, Japanese Emperor Hirohito was heard on the radio for the first time and announced an end to the fighting. The country's official surrender was signed on 2 September that same year.

Students given criteria for 'valid' mock exams,"Students have challenged the fairness of estimated grades Exams regulator Ofqual has explained what constitutes a ""valid"" mock exam for the purpose of students appealing against A-level results in England. Thousands of grades were marked down after a moderation process used in place of this summer's exams. The regulator says the system had led to many students feeling disappointed and ""results which need to be queried"". Ofqual now says where a written mock exam was not takenit will consider other teacher assessments instead.,external Neither A-level nor GCSE students were able to sit public exams this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Thursday's A-level results saw almost 40% of all grades marked down from teachers' predictions. Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life' Free exam appeals for schools in England Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual confirmed appeals using mock results could begin from Monday and would apply for GCSE, AS and A-level students as well as those taking Extended Project Qualifications and Advanced Extension Award in maths. The government had already announced any school could query a final grade if it was a lower that a student's mock exam. But with schools shutting down in March, there was a lack of clarity over what constituted a mock exam with some students complaining they did not get a chance to sit one. Ofqual says it will allow a ""non-exam assessment mark"" as the grounds for an appeal. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, criticised the process, branding it ""surreal and bureaucratic"". He said: ""This is clearly a face-saving exercise by a government which has said that it won't do a U-turn on its pledge that moderated grades will stand, come what may. ""Instead, it is attempting to remedy the grading fiasco through an appeals process so surreal and bureaucratic that it would be better off at this point doing that U-turn and allowing original teacher-assessed grades, where they are higher, to replace moderated grades."" He added: ""We don't blame Ofqual for the bizarre nature of the appeals criteria. The regulator has been given a hospital pass by a Government that is in disarray. It is time for ministers to stop the chaos and fall back on teacher-assessed grades rather than prolong this nightmare."" There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the ""calculated"" results Ofqual explained in a statement: ""This route of appeal is open to any student whose mock grade is higher than their calculated grade. We want to make sure this opportunity is available to a wide range of students, including those who had not taken a written mock exam before schools and colleges closed."" It explained the criteria under which it would accept a ""valid mock assessment"". These stipulated that work had to be: Supervised, unseen and undertaken in conditions intended to secure the work as the student's own Either past assessments produced by the relevant exam board, or assessments developed by teachers Taken under timed conditions Completed before 20 March 2020, when schools and colleges were closed Marked using a mark scheme provided by the relevant exam board Graded in line with the exam board's examination standard Ofqual added that student papers did not need to have been retained. Labour complained that under the Ofqual criteria, some students would not be able to use their mock results as the basis for an appeal if the assessment did not meet the criteria. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government appeared to be back-tracking on its ""triple lock"" promise that students could use the highest result out of their calculated grade, their mock grade or actually sitting the exam in the autumn. ""[Education secretary] Gavin Williamson promised to give students a triple lock, but instead he left many devastated by unfair exam results, and now his commitment to give them another chance is rapidly unravelling,"" she said. ""Having promised that students will be able to use a valid mock result, the reality is that many will not receive these grades even if they represent a student's best result. ""The latest chaos is the inevitable consequence of this Government's shambolic approach to exams, which saw solutions dreamt up on the back of a cigarette packet and announced barely a day before young people received their results.""

Lyon stun Man City in Champions League,"Four of Moussa Dembele's seven Champions League goals have been against Manchester City Manchester City's Champions League ambitions are in ruins once more after Lyon shocked Pep Guardiola's side in the quarter-final in Lisbon. City started as firm favourites but came out second best against a fiercely determined Lyon in a game that swung on controversy and uncharacteristic errors in the closing stages. Lyon went ahead in the 24th minute with Maxwel Cornet's smart finish but City, lifeless as Guardiola chose to play a three-man central defence, looked to have been revived by Kevin de Bruyne's precise strike from Raheem Sterling's pass after 69 minutes. Former Celtic striker Moussa Dembele, on as a substitute, restored Lyon's lead in contentious circumstances 11 minutes from time, the video assistant referee ignoring what appeared to be an obvious foul by the goalscorer before he ran on to beat Ederson. City pressed for the equaliser but Sterling was guilty of an atrocious miss, somehow sending his finish over the top of an open goal from Gabriel Jesus' pass. It proved to be hugely expensive as seconds later Lyon set up a semi-final meeting with Bayern Munich when Dembele scored his second after Ederson fumbled a shot from Houssem Aouar's routine shot. Analysis: How Guardiola messed up his big Champions League chance 'European exit reaffirms faults in this Man City team' Different year, same stuff - De Bruyne Football Daily: Man City knocked out This video can not be played Guardiola not looking to 'find excuses' for Man City exit Guardiola has rightly been showered in plaudits for the wonderful football and success he has brought to Manchester City - but his biggest target remains elusive and this was a miserable night for the manager. Guardiola, who has been accused of over-thinking his approach in the Champions League before, adopted a three-man central defensive system and chose to leave many of City's creators and manipulators on the bench. Lyon deserved respect after eliminating Juventus but this was a ploy that took it too far and resulted in a stuttering City lacking urgency and creativity. He eventually introduced Riyad Mahrez after the break to some effect but Lyon were offered hope and encouragement by Guardiola's approach and showed magnificent grit and resilience to secure the win. City will rightly claim an injustice over the VAR decision that did not penalise what appeared to be a foul on Aymeric Laporte by Dembele but the team defending for the second goal was horrific, with every City player bar keeper Ederson in the Lyon half when the goal was created when the game was finely balanced at 1-1. City and Guardiola have suffered Champions League disappointment before but this may hurt more than any other - and make no mistake, the much-feted Catalan must take his full share of responsibility for a flawed game plan. Lyon's celebrations were wild at the final whistle - and who can blame them after a magnificent victory against many experts' favourites after previously knocking out Juventus despite another stellar contribution from Cristiano Ronaldo? The French side dug deep, rode their luck at the right times, especially with Sterling's ghastly miss, and when offered the opportunity put City away. Dembele showed the poacher's instinct that made him so highly prized at Celtic and has made him a success in France to score the two goals that saw off City. Bayern Munich will be hot favourites after their astonishing 8-2 demolition of Barcelona but this revamped knockout format has already produced its share of surprises and Lyon have shown they must not be written off. Kevin de Bruyne scored City's goal and attempted 17 crosses, almost three times as much as anyone else - although he only completed 23 of his 39 passes Goalscorer Moussa Dembele speaking to RMC Sport:""We are still in it, which means we have a great team. ""We are taking it game by game, not getting carried away. We will try to be ready for Bayern."" Lyon's Rudi Garcia is the first French manager to guide a French team to the Champions League semi-finals since 2009-10 (Claude Puel with Lyon). Since progressing from his first seven Champions League quarter-finals as a manager with Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola has been eliminated in each of his three with City. The Champions League semi-finals will see two French teams (PSG, Lyon) and two German teams (RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich). It is the first time since 2012-13 that there are just two different nations at the semi-final stage. City's Kevin de Bruyne has been directly involved in more goals in 2019-20 than any other Premier League player (38 - 16 goals, 22 assists). Lyon's Maxwel Cornet and Moussa Dembele have scored four Champions League goals against City, a joint high with Lionel Messi. Raheem Sterling made his 50th Champions League appearance tonight, aged 25 years and 251 days. The only Englishman to reach this milestone at a younger age was Wayne Rooney in 2010 (24 years, 115 days). Sterling provided his 11th assist for Manchester City in the Champions League - the joint-most for the club alongside De Bruyne. Fernandinho made his 58th appearance in the Champions League for Man City - the most of any City player in the competition.

Thousands protest outside Belarus state TV,"Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Thousands of people have gathered outside the state television station in Belarus demanding full coverage of protests against the disputed presidential election. Opposition supporters outside the building in Minsk held banners with signs saying ""show people the truth"". Mass protests erupted after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in the 9 August vote. The state broadcaster initially chose not to cover the protests. The election result has been condemned with widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. This video can not be played Protesters chant anti-government slogans in a show of defiance On election day, Belarusian state channels aired the voices of Lukashenko supporters and did not cover the demonstrations. State TV later showed footage of violence to blame protesters and warn people not to participate. Several journalists have resigned over the coverage. On Friday, European Union foreign ministers agreed to prepare new sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for ""falsification"". The US has also condemned the election as ""not free and fair"". And on Saturday, three Baltic states called for the vote to be re-run. Some 100 staff came out of the state television building to join the protests and said they planned a strike on Monday, AFP news agency reports. Others have signed a letter in support of a strike. ""Like everyone we are demanding free elections and the release of those detained at mass protests,"" one employee, Andrei Yaroshevich, told AFP. Mr Lukashenko's press secretary Natalya Eismont and senate speaker Natalya Kochanova arrived at the broadcast centre to meet staff, to shouts of ""shame"" from the crowd gathered outside. This video can not be played Sergiy says riot police in Belarus threatened to burn him alive Earlier on Saturday, thousands of people waved flags, lit candles and laid flowers at the scene close to the metro station where one of the protesters, Alexander Taraikovsky, died on Monday. Others held up pictures of injured protesters, while drivers joined in by honking their horns. Many opposition supporters chanted ""Leave!"" - a call for President Lukashenko to resign - and some carried signs with slogans against police violence. The circumstances of Mr Taraikovsky's death are unclear. Officials say he died when an explosive device went off in his hand during a protest, but opposition supporters dispute this. His partner, Elena German, told the Associated Press news agency that she believed the 34-year-old was shot by police. On Friday, Ms German visited the mortuary where Mr Taraikovsky's body was held. People laid flowers and waved banners near to a metro station where a protester died ""There is a seam in the chest area - the hole was sewn up, but there is a black bruise; it's small but we noticed. His hands and feet are completely intact, there are not even bruises,"" she said. Mr Taraikovsky had worked hard at his automobile repair business, Ms German said, and that neither of them had shown an interest in politics until the presidential election when they decided to support Ms Tikhanovskaya. Analysis by Will Vernon, BBC News, Minsk There has been a clear shift in mood here. Earlier in the week, police with batons beat anyone who dared to come out on the street in the evening. But following widespread strike action in some of Belarus' largest factories, people have been emboldened to come out in greater numbers in the daytime. On Friday, workers from the famous Minsk Tractor Factory joined thousands of protesters in a spontaneous march and rally on Independence Square in Minsk. Such scenes would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago - in a country where, in normal times, any opposition to President Lukashenko is brutally repressed. One woman told us: ""We're sure everything will change. We believe in our victory. That's why we will come to the streets every day. Every day!"" A ""March for Freedom"" is also planned in the centre of the city on Sunday, a week after the contested election. It follows Ms Tikhanovskaya's call for further peaceful rallies across the country on Friday. ""Don't stay on the sidelines,"" she said. This video can not be played 'Human life is the most precious thing': Svetlana Tikhanovskaya speaks out from exile Amid the unrest, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. In a joint statement on Saturday, the prime ministers of three Baltic republics - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - ""expressed deep concern at the violent crackdown... and the political repression of the opposition by the authorities"". Lithuania and Latvia have also previously said they are prepared to mediate in Belarus, provided the authorities stopped violence against protesters and formed a national council with members of civil society. They warned that the alternative was sanctions. The leaders said the presidential election was ""neither free nor fair"" and called for a ""transparent"" vote ""with the participation of international observers"". ""The prime ministers urge the Belarusian authorities to refrain from violence against peaceful demonstrators [and to] release all political prisoners and those that have been detained,"" the statement added. Ms Tikhanovskaya left for Lithuania following the election after she publicly denounced the results. She had sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the vote. Some 6,700 people were arrested in the wake of the election, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of the security services. Amnesty International said accounts from released detainees suggested ""widespread torture"".

Musicians hire fishing boat to beat quarantine,"This video can not be played Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK A group of musicians beat the France quarantine rules with just 10 minutes to spare - after chartering a fishing boat to get them back to the UK. After a five hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. It was the first concert by the baroque ensemble since lockdown began in March. They were amongthousands of British people who were trying to get homebefore the 14-day quarantine requirement came into force at 04:00. 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine European countries fight coronavirus surge Jo Buckley, the Dunedin Consort's chief executive, told BBC Scotland they knew quarantine was a risk as they travelled to France on Wednesday. But after four months in lockdown, the musicians were desperate to play together again. And if they had withdrawn from the concert on the basis of speculation about new restrictions, the organisation would have lost ""many thousands of pounds"", she added. ""This is the impossibility of planning concerts amidst all the changing rules and regulations,"" Ms Buckley said. The Dunedin Consort performed at the Lessay Abbey before embarking on their marathon trip home When the quarantine rules were announced late on Thursday night, the group spent hours online trying to find ways to get home before the deadline. As self-employed musicians who have been hit hard economically during lockdown, they needed to return home to work. Amongst other things, they are lined up to work with the online Edinburgh Festival next week. ""We looked into ferries, the Eurotunnel, flights, even chartering a private jet â you name it, we tried it, but we couldn't find any way of doing the concert and getting home before the quarantine curfew,"" she said. Eventually - on Friday morning - they tracked down a firm which hired out a boat for fishing trips from Hayling Island. Once they finished the concert at 22:30 local time (21:30 BST), eight of the 13-strong group boarded a coach to Cherbourg where they met the Valkyrie boat. Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK They left the French port shortly before midnight and arrived in the UK about five hours later. ""It was lovely,"" Ms Buckley said. ""The boat was very comfortable. We were all able to have a little sleep inside even though we were all quite excited when we got on board. ""It was a calm night so it was a very easy crossing."" With just minutes to spare until the new restrictions came into force, they arrived in Hampshire. They were taken to London Euston by minibus and from there the musicians were able to make the final leg of the marathon journey home.

Thai king commutes sentence of UK pairâs killers,"Hannah Witheridge and David Miller's bodies were found on a beach in Koh Tao in September 2014 Two men given the death penalty for killing two British backpackers in Thailand have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao in 2014. Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo wereconvicted in a Thai court and sentenced to death in December 2015. Lin and Phyo will serve life sentences instead following a royal decree. Ms Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby in Norfolk, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey, were bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Ms Witheridge had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders in a Thai court and sentenced to death Lin and Phyo (also known asÂ Win Zaw Htun)Â were sentenced to death for the murder of Mr Miller and the murder and rape of Ms Witheridge. The two men were convicted and sentenced in 2015 and the verdict was upheld by an appeals court in 2017 and theSupreme Court in August 2019. The convictions were mired in controversy, with supporters of the two men arguing they had been framed because their initial confessions were made under duress. A royal decree said the sentences had been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday on 28 July and to ""illustrate the king's clemency"". It is unclear how many prisoners were eligible for any pardons or reduction of sentences under the different criteria listed in the decree. Correction: An earlier headline on this story referred to the killers being ""pardoned"". This was later changed to clarify that their death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment.

Tea at the Ritz soured by credit card scammers,"Diners at the luxury Ritz hotel in London have been targeted by ""extremely convincing"" scammers who posed as hotel staff to steal payment card details. The scammers phoned people with exact details of their restaurant bookings, asking them to ""confirm"" card details. They then tried to spend thousands of pounds at the catalogue retailer Argos. The Ritz told the BBC it was investigating a ""potential data breach"" and said it had alerted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The fraudsters phoned people who had already made a restaurant reservation at the Ritz, pretending to be hotel staff. How they got this information is still unknown. One woman, who had made an online booking for afternoon tea at the Ritz as part of a celebration, received a call the day before her reservation. The scammers asked her to ""confirm"" the booking by providing her payment card details. The call was convincing because it appeared to have come from the hotel's real phone number, and the scammers knew exactly when and where her reservation was. One cyber-security expert told the BBC that caller ID spoofing in this way was ""quite easy"". The scammers told the woman that her payment card had been ""declined"", and asked her for a second bank card. After they had taken the payment card details, the scammers tried to make several transactions in excess of Â£1,000 at the catalogue retailer Argos. When her bank spotted the suspicious transactions, the scammer phoned again - this time pretending to be from her bank. He told the victim that somebody was trying to use her credit card, and in order to cancel the transaction she should read out a security code sent to her mobile phone. In reality, this would have authorised the transaction. A second woman, who made her original booking over the telephone rather than online, told the BBC that the exact same tricks had been tried on her. She later felt suspicious that the scammer had not been able to correctly answer questions about the hotel's facilities. ""People tend to trust caller ID, which is perfectly understandable because in theory it appears to authenticate the caller,"" said Dr Jessica Barker, co-founder of the cyber-security company Cygenta. ""On top of that, when a scam like this involves insider information it adds an air of legitimacy and authority."" The Ritz said it had been made aware of a potential data breach within its ""food and beverage reservation system"" on 12 August. It is continuing to investigate how the scammers accessed customer information. It said it had emailed customers that may have been affected, warning them: ""After a reservation has been made at the Ritz London, our team will never contact you by telephone to request credit card details to confirm your booking with us."" It has not revealed how many people were affected. Restaurants should never phone you asking for payment information to ""confirm"" your booking. If you receive a suspicious call, you could hang up and call the venue back later - or from a different phone - using the number on their official website. Dr Barker warns against giving card details to somebody who had called you, and suggests always calling the company back yourself. If a bank believes a transaction has been fraudulent, they will not ask you for security codes in order to cancel the transaction. If you receive a suspicious call you think is pretending to be from your bank, hang up and call your bank back later - or from a different phone - using the number on the back of your payment card.

BBC presenter recovering from brain haemorrhage,"BBC presenter Clemency Burton-Hill has spoken about how music has helped her recover from a major brain haemorrhage. The 39-year-old Radio 3 host underwent emergency brain surgery after she collapsed in New York in January. Months later, she says music has played a key role, as she re-learns how to speak and walk. ""Sometimes it is the thing that gives me solace,"" she says. ""And sometimes it's the thing that helps me to get up, and fight, and to live."" ""It is the ultimate motivation,"" Clemmie - as she is known by her friends and colleagues - told friend and journalist Sophie Elmhirst. The presenter, who is behind Radio 3's award-winning Classical Fix programme, as well as a regular face on the BBC's Proms coverage, is currently living in New York where she is creative director at WQXR, the New York public radio classical music station. At the start of the year, she suffered a massive brain haemorrhage caused by a previously undiagnosed condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an uncommon and abnormal cluster of blood vessels meshing the arteries and veins in her brain. It could have been fatal. As it is, doctors removed half of her skull during emergency surgery at Mount Sinai West hospital in Manhattan, and she was unconscious for 17 days. No one was certain how much of her brain would recover. Throughout those early days, music played on a speaker by her hospital bed - the playlist compiled by her loved ones. Before she showed any sign of consciousness, British opera singer Andrew Staples - a close friend who was performing in New York when the presenter collapsed - recalls her left foot tapping along to some Brahms. ""I remember it struck me as a non-typical piece to inspire toe-tapping,"" Staples recalls. Clemmie, photographed in July 2020 in downtown Manhattan A week or so later, just as doctors were removing the tubes that had initially aided her breathing, one of Burton-Hill's favourite pieces of music, Richard Strauss's Morgen, happened to play through the speaker. ""With her good hand she grabbed my wrist as I leant over her shaven head, and I sang the words to her,"" says Staples. ""We both cried a lot. I wasn't worried from then on about whether she was 'in there' anymore."" While she can't remember that moment, Burton-Hill recalls how she seemed to make a choice of whether to give up or to live just as she was regaining consciousness. ""It was literally: I can do this, I'm going to get through this,"" she says now. ""Music is the opposite of despair. It was going to be worth the fight."" As her recovery stepped up, friend and renowned violinist Nicola Benedetti came to visit and together they play Bach, with Burton-Hill - herself a violin soloist - playing the left hand on the violin and Benedetti bowing. Astonishingly, the broadcaster still recalled all the notes. ""It's a clichÃ©d idea that music is beyond language,"" she says, ""but from what I've experienced in my own brain, I truly know that now."" Gradually, language and movement have begun to return despite the obstacles to recovery thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic. ""I really believe music is a part of my recovery because it uses both sides of the brain,"" says Burton-Hill. ""It's as though it trains your brain to be ambidextrous.""

Swimmer aims to beat Channel record and quarantine,"Chloe McCardel has now completed 35 cross-Channel swims A swimmer has broken the men's record for the number of cross-Channel crossings - and been assured her fears of falling foul of the UK-France quarantine rules are unfounded. Australian Chloe McCardel took 10 hours and 40 minutes to complete her 35th Channel crossing, after setting off from Kent on Saturday evening. She was worried arriving in Calais would require her to self-isolate. But she said UK and French coastguards have given her the all-clear. ""I'm in great spirits,"" Ms McCardel said. ""I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England. I'm extremely lucky to be surrounded by so much love and support, from my English host to my support boat captains and crew, and I'm excited to celebrate this achievement together with them."" The 35-year-old started her 21-mile swim from Abbot's Cliff beach near Folkestone at 20:00 BST on Saturday, and arrived in France just before 07:00. She intended to spend only a few moments on the French shore before swimming back out to her support boat for the return journey. ""We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,"" she had said ahead of the swim. A history of swimming the English Channel Woman first to swim Channel four times non-stop How an 11-year-old came to swim the Channel Ms McCardel is now second on the list of the most Channel swims, passing the men's record of 34 held by Briton Kevin Murphy. Equalling the women's record will be a greater task, however - Alison Streeter, the ""Queen of the English Channel"", has swum the distance 43 times. The Department of Transport had advised Ms McCardel to seek legal advice ahead of the swim. She said she has been advised by the Channel Swimming Association that her swim could go ahead. ""They said Channel swims are allowed as long as you observe social distancing when you land and don't stay on the shore for more than 10 minutes, which is standard practice for us,"" Ms McCardel told the BBC shortly before embarking on the swim. She said there was little risk of coming into contact with someone in France because her swims usually end in an area of boulders near Cap Gris-Nez. ""I usually finish where there are large boulders and it's inaccessible to people on land because you can't walk through the boulders. There's no sand,"" she said. Ms McCardel holds multiple world records for endurance swimming Ms McCardel already negotiated special dispensation from the Australian government to travel to the UK for her record attempt. In recent weeks she has completed three Channel crossings, taking her level with British swimmer Mr Murphy, on 34 crossings. She told the Daily Telegraph that she hopes that her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Speaking after completing her feat, Ms McCardel said: ""It's a very momentous occasion and I'm very proud to be able to represent Australia. ""I've also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I'm proud to be able to be a voice for those who don't have one."" Ms McCardel holds multiple records for endurance swimming, including the longest ratified unassisted ocean swim in 2014, when she covered 77.3 miles (124.4km) in 41.5 hours in the waters around the Bahamas. In 2017, she became the first person to attempt a quadruple non-stop crossing of the English Channel, but she was not successful in completing the 84-mile journey. The feat wasfinally achieved by Sarah Thomas, from the United States, last year- one year after she was treated for breast cancer.

Thousands attend Belarus protester's funeral,"Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Thousands of people have gathered outside the state television station in Belarus demanding full coverage of protests against the disputed presidential election. Opposition supporters outside the building in Minsk held banners with signs saying ""show people the truth"". Mass protests erupted after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in the 9 August vote. The state broadcaster initially chose not to cover the protests. The election result has been condemned with widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. This video can not be played Protesters chant anti-government slogans in a show of defiance On election day, Belarusian state channels aired the voices of Lukashenko supporters and did not cover the demonstrations. State TV later showed footage of violence to blame protesters and warn people not to participate. Several journalists have resigned over the coverage. On Friday, European Union foreign ministers agreed to prepare new sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for ""falsification"". The US has also condemned the election as ""not free and fair"". And on Saturday, three Baltic states called for the vote to be re-run. Some 100 staff came out of the state television building to join the protests and said they planned a strike on Monday, AFP news agency reports. Others have signed a letter in support of a strike. ""Like everyone we are demanding free elections and the release of those detained at mass protests,"" one employee, Andrei Yaroshevich, told AFP. Mr Lukashenko's press secretary Natalya Eismont and senate speaker Natalya Kochanova arrived at the broadcast centre to meet staff, to shouts of ""shame"" from the crowd gathered outside. This video can not be played Sergiy says riot police in Belarus threatened to burn him alive Earlier on Saturday, thousands of people waved flags, lit candles and laid flowers at the scene close to the metro station where one of the protesters, Alexander Taraikovsky, died on Monday. Others held up pictures of injured protesters, while drivers joined in by honking their horns. Many opposition supporters chanted ""Leave!"" - a call for President Lukashenko to resign - and some carried signs with slogans against police violence. The circumstances of Mr Taraikovsky's death are unclear. Officials say he died when an explosive device went off in his hand during a protest, but opposition supporters dispute this. His partner, Elena German, told the Associated Press news agency that she believed the 34-year-old was shot by police. On Friday, Ms German visited the mortuary where Mr Taraikovsky's body was held. People laid flowers and waved banners near to a metro station where a protester died ""There is a seam in the chest area - the hole was sewn up, but there is a black bruise; it's small but we noticed. His hands and feet are completely intact, there are not even bruises,"" she said. Mr Taraikovsky had worked hard at his automobile repair business, Ms German said, and that neither of them had shown an interest in politics until the presidential election when they decided to support Ms Tikhanovskaya. Analysis by Will Vernon, BBC News, Minsk There has been a clear shift in mood here. Earlier in the week, police with batons beat anyone who dared to come out on the street in the evening. But following widespread strike action in some of Belarus' largest factories, people have been emboldened to come out in greater numbers in the daytime. On Friday, workers from the famous Minsk Tractor Factory joined thousands of protesters in a spontaneous march and rally on Independence Square in Minsk. Such scenes would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago - in a country where, in normal times, any opposition to President Lukashenko is brutally repressed. One woman told us: ""We're sure everything will change. We believe in our victory. That's why we will come to the streets every day. Every day!"" A ""March for Freedom"" is also planned in the centre of the city on Sunday, a week after the contested election. It follows Ms Tikhanovskaya's call for further peaceful rallies across the country on Friday. ""Don't stay on the sidelines,"" she said. This video can not be played 'Human life is the most precious thing': Svetlana Tikhanovskaya speaks out from exile Amid the unrest, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. In a joint statement on Saturday, the prime ministers of three Baltic republics - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - ""expressed deep concern at the violent crackdown... and the political repression of the opposition by the authorities"". Lithuania and Latvia have also previously said they are prepared to mediate in Belarus, provided the authorities stopped violence against protesters and formed a national council with members of civil society. They warned that the alternative was sanctions. The leaders said the presidential election was ""neither free nor fair"" and called for a ""transparent"" vote ""with the participation of international observers"". ""The prime ministers urge the Belarusian authorities to refrain from violence against peaceful demonstrators [and to] release all political prisoners and those that have been detained,"" the statement added. Ms Tikhanovskaya left for Lithuania following the election after she publicly denounced the results. She had sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the vote. Some 6,700 people were arrested in the wake of the election, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of the security services. Amnesty International said accounts from released detainees suggested ""widespread torture"".

Australia surfer saves wife by punching shark,"Earlier this year a teenage surfer was killed by a shark off New South Wales A man leapt from his surfboard on to a shark that was attacking his wife, repeatedly punching the animal until it let go, Australian media report. Chantelle Doyle, 35, was surfing off Shelly Beach at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, when the attack took place. Her husband punched the shark until it released its grip and then helped Ms Doyle to the shore. She was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries to her right leg. Experts quoted by the Port Macquarie News believed Ms Doyle had been mauled by a juvenile great white shark up to 3m (10ft) in length. Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steven Pearce praised the husband - named by media as Mark Rapley - for his quick action. ""This fella paddled over and jumped off his board on to the shark and hit it to get it to release her and then assisted her back into the beach,"" he said, quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""Pretty full on, really heroic."" Inspector Andrew Beverley, of Ambulance NSW, said people on the beach administered first aid to Ms Doyle before medics arrived. ""The bystanders on scene that rendered assistance should be commended. They did an amazing job,"" he said. He added that it was the third serious shark attack on that stretch of coast in recent months. Ms Doyle was flown to Newcastle Hospital for surgery and was in a stable condition.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent nine fire engines to the scene in Janefield Avenue and crews removed the man from the vehicle. Paramedics took the man to hospital and nine train passengers were escorted to safety by firefighters.

China restaurant apologises for weighing customers,"Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on Weibo A restaurant in central China has apologised for encouraging diners to weigh themselves and then order food accordingly. The policy was introduced after a national campaign against food waste was launched. The beef restaurant in the city of Changsha placed two large scales at its entrance this week. It then asked diners to enter their measurements into an app that would then suggest menu items accordingly. Signs reading ""be thrifty and diligent, promote empty plates"" and ""operation empty plate"" were pinned up. China's Xi tells people to stop wasting food The policy caused uproar on Chinese social media. Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on the social platform Weibo. The restaurant said it was ""deeply sorry"" for its interpretation of the national ""Clean Plate Campaign"". ""Our original intentions were to advocate stopping waste and ordering food in a healthy way. We never forced customers to weigh themselves,"" it said in an apology posted online. President Xi Jinping ignited the campaign this week, calling the levels of national food wastage ""shocking and distressing"". Following Mr Xi's message, the Wuhan Catering Industry Association urged restaurants in the city to limit the number of dishes served to diners - implementing a system where groups have to order one dish fewer than the number of diners. State TV also criticised livestreamers who filmed themselves eating large amounts of food.

"Swimmer aims to beat Channel record and quarantineChloe McCardel hopes her 35th Channel swim, beating the men's record, will not end in self-isolation.UK","Chloe McCardel has now completed 35 cross-Channel swims A swimmer has broken the men's record for the number of cross-Channel crossings - and been assured her fears of falling foul of the UK-France quarantine rules are unfounded. Australian Chloe McCardel took 10 hours and 40 minutes to complete her 35th Channel crossing, after setting off from Kent on Saturday evening. She was worried arriving in Calais would require her to self-isolate. But she said UK and French coastguards have given her the all-clear. ""I'm in great spirits,"" Ms McCardel said. ""I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England. I'm extremely lucky to be surrounded by so much love and support, from my English host to my support boat captains and crew, and I'm excited to celebrate this achievement together with them."" The 35-year-old started her 21-mile swim from Abbot's Cliff beach near Folkestone at 20:00 BST on Saturday, and arrived in France just before 07:00. She intended to spend only a few moments on the French shore before swimming back out to her support boat for the return journey. ""We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,"" she had said ahead of the swim. A history of swimming the English Channel Woman first to swim Channel four times non-stop How an 11-year-old came to swim the Channel Ms McCardel is now second on the list of the most Channel swims, passing the men's record of 34 held by Briton Kevin Murphy. Equalling the women's record will be a greater task, however - Alison Streeter, the ""Queen of the English Channel"", has swum the distance 43 times. The Department of Transport had advised Ms McCardel to seek legal advice ahead of the swim. She said she has been advised by the Channel Swimming Association that her swim could go ahead. ""They said Channel swims are allowed as long as you observe social distancing when you land and don't stay on the shore for more than 10 minutes, which is standard practice for us,"" Ms McCardel told the BBC shortly before embarking on the swim. She said there was little risk of coming into contact with someone in France because her swims usually end in an area of boulders near Cap Gris-Nez. ""I usually finish where there are large boulders and it's inaccessible to people on land because you can't walk through the boulders. There's no sand,"" she said. Ms McCardel holds multiple world records for endurance swimming Ms McCardel already negotiated special dispensation from the Australian government to travel to the UK for her record attempt. In recent weeks she has completed three Channel crossings, taking her level with British swimmer Mr Murphy, on 34 crossings. She told the Daily Telegraph that she hopes that her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Speaking after completing her feat, Ms McCardel said: ""It's a very momentous occasion and I'm very proud to be able to represent Australia. ""I've also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I'm proud to be able to be a voice for those who don't have one."" Ms McCardel holds multiple records for endurance swimming, including the longest ratified unassisted ocean swim in 2014, when she covered 77.3 miles (124.4km) in 41.5 hours in the waters around the Bahamas. In 2017, she became the first person to attempt a quadruple non-stop crossing of the English Channel, but she was not successful in completing the 84-mile journey. The feat wasfinally achieved by Sarah Thomas, from the United States, last year- one year after she was treated for breast cancer.

France quarantine starts after deadline scramble,"Thousands of British holidaymakers have made a last-minute dash to get home before a 14-day quarantine requirement came into force for people arriving from France. The isolation measure also applies to the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba, amid concerns about a rising numbers of Covid cases. Eurotunnel trains sold out and air fares were up to six times more than normal, but ferries increased capacity. France warned of ""reciprocal measures"". The Netherlandsadvised against all but essential travel to the UK,externalonce the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but said it would not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. I'm in France right now - what do I do? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge There were reported to be about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France when the changes were announced, and the deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Kim Wells and his family were on one of the last ferries to arrive in the UK before the quarantine measures began - getting in to Newhaven from Dieppe in northern France with eight minutes to spare. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had a ""pretty fraught 40 minutes"" online after hearing of the restrictions through a BBC News alert. ""I ended up booking a ferry on a pretty unfashionable route... it was impossible to get back on Eurotunnel, which was the way we went to France originally,"" he said. Mr Wells is a teacher and his wife is a local government worker. They felt they should cut their holiday short to avoid having to quarantine as they are key workers. This video can not be played British holidaymaker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Mr Wells said he was frustrated by the short notice the government had given for the rule change, adding: ""I completely understand the decision, but I think 30 hours' notice and announcing it at 11 o'clock in the evening French time... was pretty unrealistic. ""I don't really understand why they can't be a little bit more clear with the public about what the tipping point is, when we might perhaps be approaching the need to quarantine. Why not 48 or even 72 [hours] just to allow those who need to or want to get home, get home without rushing dangerously.""

""Our immediate response was 'let's just stay and finish our holiday', and then we started to really consider what quarantine meant,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""There would be no way we could leave the house... that's when we decided we would come back."" Kate Mooney and her family cut their holiday short by a week Tom Duffell, who runs a small business and ended his family holiday in Nice four days early, told the BBC that social distancing had ""gone out of the window"" in the scramble for transport, with ""huge queues"" at the airport. Eurotunnel, which increased its capacity, said 12,000 people had tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced - at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the deadline. Additional staff were sent to the terminals to allow 11,600 vehicles to quickly load its shuttles throughout Friday. P&O Ferries and DFDS Ferries also added an extra four departures. Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK Meanwhile, a group of musicians from Scotland found a creative way to beat the deadline with just 10 minutes to spare - bychartering a fishing boatto get them back to the UK. After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50.

France quarantine starts after deadline scrambleHolidaymakers had just hours to return to the UK to avoid the 14-day self-isolation requirement.,"Thousands of British holidaymakers have made a last-minute dash to get home before a 14-day quarantine requirement came into force for people arriving from France. The isolation measure also applies to the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba, amid concerns about a rising numbers of Covid cases. Eurotunnel trains sold out and air fares were up to six times more than normal, but ferries increased capacity. France warned of ""reciprocal measures"". The Netherlandsadvised against all but essential travel to the UK,externalonce the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but said it would not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. I'm in France right now - what do I do? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge There were reported to be about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France when the changes were announced, and the deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Kim Wells and his family were on one of the last ferries to arrive in the UK before the quarantine measures began - getting in to Newhaven from Dieppe in northern France with eight minutes to spare. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had a ""pretty fraught 40 minutes"" online after hearing of the restrictions through a BBC News alert. ""I ended up booking a ferry on a pretty unfashionable route... it was impossible to get back on Eurotunnel, which was the way we went to France originally,"" he said. Mr Wells is a teacher and his wife is a local government worker. They felt they should cut their holiday short to avoid having to quarantine as they are key workers. This video can not be played British holidaymaker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Mr Wells said he was frustrated by the short notice the government had given for the rule change, adding: ""I completely understand the decision, but I think 30 hours' notice and announcing it at 11 o'clock in the evening French time... was pretty unrealistic. ""I don't really understand why they can't be a little bit more clear with the public about what the tipping point is, when we might perhaps be approaching the need to quarantine. Why not 48 or even 72 [hours] just to allow those who need to or want to get home, get home without rushing dangerously."" This video can not be played BBC journalist made a video diary as her family had to cut short their holiday Kate Mooney and her family arrived back at their home in Cornwall at about 01:00 BST after ending their holiday to France a week early. ""Our immediate response was 'let's just stay and finish our holiday', and then we started to really consider what quarantine meant,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""There would be no way we could leave the house... that's when we decided we would come back."" Kate Mooney and her family cut their holiday short by a week Tom Duffell, who runs a small business and ended his family holiday in Nice four days early, told the BBC that social distancing had ""gone out of the window"" in the scramble for transport, with ""huge queues"" at the airport. Eurotunnel, which increased its capacity, said 12,000 people had tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced - at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the deadline. Additional staff were sent to the terminals to allow 11,600 vehicles to quickly load its shuttles throughout Friday. P&O Ferries and DFDS Ferries also added an extra four departures. Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK Meanwhile, a group of musicians from Scotland found a creative way to beat the deadline with just 10 minutes to spare - bychartering a fishing boatto get them back to the UK. After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work?

Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life',"This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" A student rejected by her chosen university after her A-levels were downgraded has told schools minister Nick Gibb, ""you've ruined my life"". Nina Bunting-Mitcham, speaking on the BBC's Any Questions, said her marks were three grades lower than predicted. And talking to the BBC on Saturday, she said that getting three Ds had made her feel like life ""was completely over"". The government says it will cover the cost of appeals after 280,000 grades in England were downgraded. With school exams cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's grades in England were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. In England,36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predictedand 3% were down two grades, prompting anger and distress among schools, colleges and students. Nina told the BBC her teachers were ""utterly shocked"" on learning her predicted results of ABB - in biology, chemistry and psychology - had plummeted. The pupil at New College, Stamford, confronted Nick Gibb on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday. ""It's got to be a mistake, I have never been a D-grade student,"" she told him. ""I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can't get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life."" ""You have ruined my life."" Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Responding to Nina, Mr Gibb said it was ""rare"" for students to be downgraded three grades, adding it ""should not have happened"". ""It won't ruin your life, it will be sorted, I can assure you."" He admitted to ""imperfections somewhere in the system"" and said challenged grades would be addressed ""swiftly"", by 7 September at the latest. Ministers are expected to set up a taskforce, led by Mr Gibb, to oversee the appeals process. Disappointed students protested in Westminster on Friday Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Nina said she felt ""encouraged"" by the minister's words, but believed his statement contradicted previous assurances by the government that the grading system was ""robust"". She said she had begun the appeals process, but it was still not clear whether revised grades would be based on mock exams or teachers' predictions - and the Royal Veterinary College would only keep her place open until 31 August. ""They [the government] need to believe in the teachers,"" she said. ""The teachers are professionals. They see students every day, they talk to them, they know them personally... They are the best people to predict the grades."" Why did the A-level algorithm say no? The Department of Education said it had introduced a ""triple lock system"", meaning those pupils ""unhappy with their calculated grades can appeal on the basis of a valid mock result"" or sit an exam in the autumn. The government also said it would reimburse the cost of an appeal - which can reach Â£150 - to ensure that head teachers were not deterred from taking on harder to prove cases. However, one head teacher told BBC Breakfast it was a ""token gesture"", adding that appeals were already free if they were successful. Meanwhile,Oxford's Worcester College said it would honour all offersit had made to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Admissions tutor Prof Laura Ashe said it was ""the morally right thing to do"". Because students had not taken any exams, ""we took the view there wasn't going to be any new information that could justify rejecting someone to whom we'd made an offer"", she said. She said the algorithm used to adjust grades ""literally copied the inequalities that are currently existing in our education system"", with a quarter of the college's state school applicants being downgraded, but only 10% of private school candidates. Ofqual adjusted the results to make the spread of grades look right at a national level, she said, but ""they can't possibly tell us that they've given the right grades to the right people"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he was ""fully prepared to take legal action"",  arguing that Ofqual's grading system was ""straightforwardly discriminatory"" against working class and ethnic minority students who are more likely to attend large, urban sixth form colleges. ""It discriminates against young people on the basis of the institution that they went to, rather than their ability."" ""I cannot stand by and see thousands of lives ruined across Greater Manchester,"" he told BBC Breakfast, calling the process ""fundamentally unfair"". He accused the government of being ""out of touch"" and called the grading system ""the single biggest act of levelling down that this country has ever seen"". There have been calls to move away from the system and use teachers' predictions - following aU-turn by the government in Scotland, where downgraded results have been replaced by the original teacher estimates. But England's exam watchdog, Ofqual, has warned that using teachers' predictions would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As in England. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has vowed there will be ""no U-turn"" while insisting his ""absolute priority is fairness"". Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Education Committee, joined opposition parties in expressing concernover what Labour termed an ""exams fiasco"". He called on Ofqual to publish details of the algorithm it used to make its calculations, adding: ""If the model has penalised disadvantaged groups, this is very serious.""

BBC presenter says music helped her 'to live',"BBC presenter Clemency Burton-Hill has spoken about how music has helped her recover from a major brain haemorrhage. The 39-year-old Radio 3 host underwent emergency brain surgery after she collapsed in New York in January. Months later, she says music has played a key role, as she re-learns how to speak and walk. ""Sometimes it is the thing that gives me solace,"" she says. ""And sometimes it's the thing that helps me to get up, and fight, and to live."" ""It is the ultimate motivation,"" Clemmie - as she is known by her friends and colleagues - told friend and journalist Sophie Elmhirst. The presenter, who is behind Radio 3's award-winning Classical Fix programme, as well as a regular face on the BBC's Proms coverage, is currently living in New York where she is creative director at WQXR, the New York public radio classical music station. At the start of the year, she suffered a massive brain haemorrhage caused by a previously undiagnosed condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an uncommon and abnormal cluster of blood vessels meshing the arteries and veins in her brain. It could have been fatal. As it is, doctors removed half of her skull during emergency surgery at Mount Sinai West hospital in Manhattan, and she was unconscious for 17 days. No one was certain how much of her brain would recover. Throughout those early days, music played on a speaker by her hospital bed - the playlist compiled by her loved ones. Before she showed any sign of consciousness, British opera singer Andrew Staples - a close friend who was performing in New York when the presenter collapsed - recalls her left foot tapping along to some Brahms. ""I remember it struck me as a non-typical piece to inspire toe-tapping,"" Staples recalls. Clemmie, photographed in July 2020 in downtown Manhattan A week or so later, just as doctors were removing the tubes that had initially aided her breathing, one of Burton-Hill's favourite pieces of music, Richard Strauss's Morgen, happened to play through the speaker. ""With her good hand she grabbed my wrist as I leant over her shaven head, and I sang the words to her,"" says Staples. ""We both cried a lot. I wasn't worried from then on about whether she was 'in there' anymore."" While she can't remember that moment, Burton-Hill recalls how she seemed to make a choice of whether to give up or to live just as she was regaining consciousness. ""It was literally: I can do this, I'm going to get through this,"" she says now. ""Music is the opposite of despair. It was going to be worth the fight."" As her recovery stepped up, friend and renowned violinist Nicola Benedetti came to visit and together they play Bach, with Burton-Hill - herself a violin soloist - playing the left hand on the violin and Benedetti bowing. Astonishingly, the broadcaster still recalled all the notes. ""It's a clichÃ©d idea that music is beyond language,"" she says, ""but from what I've experienced in my own brain, I truly know that now."" Gradually, language and movement have begun to return despite the obstacles to recovery thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic. ""I really believe music is a part of my recovery because it uses both sides of the brain,"" says Burton-Hill. ""It's as though it trains your brain to be ambidextrous.""

Recap: World Snooker Championship final - O'Sullivan opens four frame lead over Wilson,"O'Sullivan opens up 10-7 lead in race to 18 'The Rocket' aiming for sixth World crown and record 37th ranking title Wilson playing in maiden World final Sessions at 13:30 and 19:30 BST on Sunday Get involved using #bbcsnooker Steve Sutcliffe As I mentioned at moment ago Ronnie O'Sullivan is hoping for a sixth world title, which would take him level with Ray Reardon and Steve Davis. In terms of modern day (and I say that loosely) champions Stephen Hendry is very much, 'top of the list, King of the hill, a number one,' to coin a line from a famous Frank Sinatra track. Though of course Joe Davis (15), Fred Davis (8) and John Pulman (8) had won a fair few long before my lifetime. Right it is time for me to depart. Who would have thought Ronnie O'Sullivan would be pegged back by Kyren Wilson in such a fashion. Our report on how it sets up a fascinating conclusion to this match on Sunday, isavailable here. Thanks for joining me. I'll see you all again in the same spot at 13:15 BST. O'Sullivan 10-7 Wilson Ken Doherty1997 world champion on BBC Two It is set up lovely, for all those who thought this was going to be one-way traffic, they have another thing coming. Kyren Wilson won the second session but it was almost undone by that missed red which you would not expect him to miss. #bbcsnooker or text 81111 (UK only) Sean:For Ronnie to play as badly as he has today and still lead 10-7 is a minor miracle. Anything could happen tomorrow. Sofie:Donât know what just happened tonight and how on earth Ronnie OâSullivan managed to go into the final day leading 10-7. If he shares both sessions, number six will be his. O'Sullivan 10-7 Wilson Steve DavisSix-time world champion on BBC Two Ronnie O'Sullivan came off wiping his brow. He has been through the mill. He had to sit and suffer for a long period of time while he went off the boil and his opponent fought back. I think Kyren will sleep the easier of the two but he will have to come out again and generate some more action. #bbcsnooker or text 81111 (UK only) James:Somehow Ronnie has come out of a terrible session with a two-frame lead... Not quite sure how. Jamie Miles: Fantastic comeback by Kyren to certainly make a game of it tomorrow, although he may well rue throwing that last frame of the session away. Should be going into tomorrow 9-8 down. To say that from 8-2 down is miraculous. Jess Pegg:What an evening of snooker that was ! Tense and nail biting! Bring on tomorrow. OâSullivan 10-7 Wilson Ken Doherty1997 world champion on BBC Two Ronnie O'Sullivan will be over the moon to be up 10-7, even though he lost the session. What a turning point that red may prove to be. Ronnie held his bottle well. OâSullivan 10-7 Wilson Now you've heard us rambling on about Ronnie O'Sullivan's troubles this evening. But here's some great insight on the matter from two former world champions. This video can not be played Analysis: What's wrong with Ronnie O'Sullivan? OâSullivan 10-7 Wilson John Parrott1991 world champion on BBC Two Wilson was 8-2 down so he'll take 10-7 from there. Something in this session for both of them. Frame 17: OâSullivan 10-7 Wilson Who would have predicted that at 8-2 to Ronnie O'Sullivan. Great fightback from Kyren Wilson that could with a touch more luck have ended even better. Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Wow. A heavy contact on a red brings Ronnie's potential frame-winning break to a close. Kyren Wilson fancies this. If he were to win this frame... crikey. Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Yep it's not been great Andy but he's in the balls now and already up to 40. #bbcsnooker or text 81111 (UK only) Will Greaves:Reckon the last time Ronnie actually played a decent full session of snooker was against Thepchaiya in the 1st round. Andy Hughes:Definitely the worst session I've ever seen Ronnie play at the world championships!!! Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson John Parrott1991 world champion on BBC Two Absolutely nothing you can do about that. Just one of the cruel fates of the game i'm afraid. Can Ronnie find that concentration he has been lacking? Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Kyren Wilson really looks like he is enjoying himself now. But his break comes to an abrupt end on 29 and to compound matters Ronnie O'Sullivan flukes a red into the bottom right corner. You couldn't make it up could you? Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Stephen HendrySeven-time world champion on BBC Two You have one player who looks focused and determined and another who just looks like he wants to get out of there. Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Big.Big.Frame. And a superb start to it for Kyren Wilson who drops in a glorious long red to a shake of the head from Ronnie O'Sullivan.  Frame 17: OâSullivan 9-7 Wilson Steve DavisSix-time world champion on BBC Two Ronnie is usually a brilliant front runner and in the nicest possible way a great bully at the table  but he has unraveled. Nobody could have foreseen this at 8-2. Frame 17: O'Sullivan 9-7 Wilson Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pupils can appeal 'lower than predicted' A-levelsThey can appeal grades if there is evidence from the school their results should have been better.Wales,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass Pupils can appeal A-level grades if they are lower than what was predicted by teachers following an outcry over results. Pupils had accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has confirmed appeals will be allowed if ""there is evidence"" pupils should have received higher grades. She said it gave ""clarity"" to students. Ms Williams said the broadening of appeals by Qualifications Wales, meant students could now appeal if there was ""evidence of internal assessments that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade they have been awarded"". Students receiving results at Ysgol Glan Clwyd on Thursday The Welsh Government had faced backlash from students, teachers, education bodies, and some of its own backbenchers, following the publication of A-level results on Thursday. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, exams were cancelled this year, with students' final grades based on teachers' estimations. Unfair results claim after grades lowered A-level results in Wales: Senedd committee recalled But the exam watchdog, Qualifications Wales, lowered more than 40% of grades in a standardisation process after finding some teachers had been ""too generous"". The detail of the results also showed more pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1% - compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible. On Wednesday, hours before students found out their results, the education minister guaranteed that no-one would get a lower grade in their A-level than they achieved in their AS result. Ms Williams had said she had to act to stop Welsh students being ""disadvantaged"" following changes to results in England, and Scotland. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. Some students have spoken of getting results up to two grades lower than predicted, and being rejected by universities after not meeting required grades. The latest guidance from Qualifications Wales now states: An appeal can now be made on the grounds that there is evidence of internal assessment that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the calculated grade awarded. Internal assessment evidence will need to meet specific criteria ""which is being finalised and will be published shortly"". If the appeal is successful, the learner's grade will be revised ""to be the same as their internal assessment grade"" but no higher than the centre assessment grade. The watchdog said: ""We have worked closely with WJEC [exam board] and considered the changes being introduced in England to find the best way forward for Welsh learners. As a result, it said, it was extending the grounds for appeal for this summer's GCSE, AS and A levels, and the Welsh Bacc qualifications. This does not go as far as saying pupils who are unhappy will get the grade estimated for them by teachers. But it does allow appeals to be based on some of the evidence used by schools and colleges to decide those grades. The big difference is that before this change, appeals could only be pursued on administrative grounds - for example, concerns that the exam board had used the wrong data. There'll be more information in the next couple of days but there are some immediate questions about the practicalities of it all. In view of the uproar since grades were published, it is inevitable there will be a huge number of appeals now the criteria has been opened up. But how quickly can those be dealt with, when in many cases places at university depend on the result. Some will still argue that it would be more straightforward and fairer to issue the original grades submitted by teachers, as happened in Scotland. The Welsh Government's, WJEC and Qualifications Wales handling of the exam results process is set to be examined by a Senedd committee next week. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has urged the Welsh Government to ensure pupils in Wales are awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. ""I would rather trust in teachers than an algorithm when it comes to a fair assessment of how a pupil would perform in an exam,"" he said. Reacting to the development he tweeted: ""Instead of adding yet more complexity and uncertainty, Welsh Govt should simply admit the failure and accept the teacher assessed grades."" Conservative MS Darren Millar earlier had called the situation ""a mess"" and urged a review. ""There have been A-grades downgraded to D's and B's to U's without any explanation or justification as to why these decisions have been made, and without regard to evidence provided by teachers on the progress of their students."" The Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said while she was pleased the Welsh Government had changed the appeals process, there needed to be guarantees the system would ""not collapse under the demand"". ""If that guarantee can't be given then today's announcement may still not allay concerns. I look forward to those guarantees being given swiftly and with confidence or this will not be going away,"" she said.

"Australia surfer saves wife by punching sharkA husband leapt on to the shark as it attacked his wife off Port Macquarie, New South Wales.","Earlier this year a teenage surfer was killed by a shark off New South Wales A man leapt from his surfboard on to a shark that was attacking his wife, repeatedly punching the animal until it let go, Australian media report. Chantelle Doyle, 35, was surfing off Shelly Beach at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, when the attack took place. Her husband punched the shark until it released its grip and then helped Ms Doyle to the shore. She was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries to her right leg. Experts quoted by the Port Macquarie News believed Ms Doyle had been mauled by a juvenile great white shark up to 3m (10ft) in length. Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steven Pearce praised the husband - named by media as Mark Rapley - for his quick action. ""This fella paddled over and jumped off his board on to the shark and hit it to get it to release her and then assisted her back into the beach,"" he said, quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""Pretty full on, really heroic."" Inspector Andrew Beverley, of Ambulance NSW, said people on the beach administered first aid to Ms Doyle before medics arrived. ""The bystanders on scene that rendered assistance should be commended. They did an amazing job,"" he said. He added that it was the third serious shark attack on that stretch of coast in recent months. Ms Doyle was flown to Newcastle Hospital for surgery and was in a stable condition.

Robot boat completes three-week Atlantic missionA UK uncrewed ocean-going vessel provides a glimpse of the future of robotic maritime operations.,"The robot boat was controlled via satellite from SEA-KIT's HQ in Tollesbury in Essex A UK boat has just provided an impressive demonstration of the future of robotic maritime operations. The 12m Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer has completed a 22-day-long mission to map an area of seafloor in the Atlantic. SEA-KIT International, which developed the craft, ""skippered"" the entire outing via satellite from its base in Tollesbury in eastern England. The mission was part-funded by the European Space Agency. Robot boats promise a dramatic change in the way we work at sea. Already, many of the big survey companies that run traditional crewed vessels have started to invest heavily in the new, remotely operated technologies. Freight companies are also acknowledging the cost advantages that will come from running robot ships. But ""over-the-horizon"" control has to show it's practical and safe if it's to gain wide acceptance. Hence, the demonstration from Maxlimer. Robots go their own way deep in the ocean One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped Ocean survey company goes for robot boats at scale The boat mapped a section of seafloor on the edge of the continental shelf The USV was despatched from Plymouth in late July and sent to a location some 460km (280 miles) to the south-west. With a multi-beam echo-sounder attached to its hull, the boat mapped more than 1,000sq km of continental shelf area, down to about a kilometre in depth. This was a segment of seafloor that had essentially no modern data registered with the UK Hydrographic Office. SEA-KIT had wanted to send the USV across the Atlantic to America for the demonstration, but the Covid-19 crisis made this impossible to organise. ""The project's overall aim was to demonstrate the capabilities of current technologies to survey unexplored or inadequately surveyed ocean frontiers and despite the planning challenges we faced due to Covid-19, I feel that we have done that. We have proven the true over-the-horizon capability of our USV design and the team are exhausted but elated,"" the company's director of technology, Peter Walker, said. The USV Maxlimer was originally developed for -and won- the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE. This was a competition to find the next-generation technologies that could be used to map the global ocean floor.Four-fifths of the sea bottom have yet to be surveyedto an acceptable resolution. Robotic solutions will be essential if we're to have any chance of closing the knowledge gap. Artwork: The Netherlands-headquartered multinational Fugro has ordered a fleet of USVs from SEA-KIT Maxlimer makes use of a communications and control system known as Global Situational Awareness via Internet. This allows an operator to remotely access CCTV footage, thermal imaging and radar through the vessel, as well as listen live to the USV's surroundings and even communicate with others in the vicinity. Maxlimer links to three independent satellite systems to stay in contact with the control room in Tollesbury. The robot boat moves slowly, at up to 4 knots (7km/h; 5mph), but its hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system is highly efficient. SEA-KIT CEO and designer, Ben Simpson, told BBC News: ""We had a sweepstake on how much fuel would be left in the tank. We thought there was going to be 300-400 litres. It turned out there was 1,300 litres."" In other words, Maxlimer returned to Plymouth with its fuel tank still around a third full. As well as the European Space Agency, partners on the project included Global Marine Group, Map the Gaps, Teledyne CARIS, Woods Hole Group and the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. Another partner was Fugro, one of the world's biggest marine geotechnical companies. The multinational recently announced a contract with SEA-KIT to purchase a fleet of USVs to use in survey work in the oil, gas and offshore wind sectors.

"Australia surfer saves wife by punching sharkA husband leapt on to the shark as it attacked his wife off Port Macquarie, New South Wales.Australia","Earlier this year a teenage surfer was killed by a shark off New South Wales A man leapt from his surfboard on to a shark that was attacking his wife, repeatedly punching the animal until it let go, Australian media report. Chantelle Doyle, 35, was surfing off Shelly Beach at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, when the attack took place. Her husband punched the shark until it released its grip and then helped Ms Doyle to the shore. She was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries to her right leg. Experts quoted by the Port Macquarie News believed Ms Doyle had been mauled by a juvenile great white shark up to 3m (10ft) in length. Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steven Pearce praised the husband - named by media as Mark Rapley - for his quick action. ""This fella paddled over and jumped off his board on to the shark and hit it to get it to release her and then assisted her back into the beach,"" he said, quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""Pretty full on, really heroic."" Inspector Andrew Beverley, of Ambulance NSW, said people on the beach administered first aid to Ms Doyle before medics arrived. ""The bystanders on scene that rendered assistance should be commended. They did an amazing job,"" he said. He added that it was the third serious shark attack on that stretch of coast in recent months. Ms Doyle was flown to Newcastle Hospital for surgery and was in a stable condition.

US Postal Service warns of risks to mail-in votesThe agency warns that millions of mail-in votes may not arrive on time to be counted by election day.US Election 2020,"The US Postal Service (USPS) has warned that millions of mail-in votes may not arrive in time to be counted on the presidential election day, 3 November. In letters to states across the country last month, the agency said ""certain deadlines... are incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards"". Critics have blamed the new USPS head - a loyal supporter of President Donald Trump - for a slowdown in deliveries. A record number of people are expected to vote by mail due to the pandemic. But on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was blocking additional funding for the USPS to help with election issues, because he opposed mail-in voting. He has repeatedly said mail-in ballots will lead to voting fraud - and give a boost to his rival Democrat Joe Biden. Experts say the mail-in voting system - which is used by the American military and by Mr Trump himself - is safe from tampering. Former President Barack Obama strongly criticised what he described as Mr Trump's ""attempts to undermine the election"", writing on Twitter that the administration was ""more concerned with suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus"". Trump blocks postal funds to stymie mail-in voting Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats call for probe into US postal service Meanwhile, Congress's two top Democrats - Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer - called on the president to stop his ""assault"" on the postal service and ""allow the 2020 election to proceed without his sabotage tactics"". Their comments come as a poll by Axios/ Survey Monkey found that three quarters of Republican voters plan to vote in person, while more than half of Democratic voters plan to use a mail vote. Private delivery services Fedex and UPS have both rejected calls to help ease the pressure on the postal agency. Meanwhile,the USPS has reportedly begun removing mail sorting machines,external- many of which would normally be used to process ballots during the election - according to Vice. The USPS, which has long been in financial trouble and carries about $160bn (Â£122bn) in debt, sent letters to states across the US in July. It warned that it could not guarantee that all votes cast by mail would arrive on time to be counted. At least 15 states have received a letter, according to NBC News. In a letter to Pennsylvania's secretary of state, the USPS said mail-in ballots requested one week before the 3 November election - allowed under the state's election laws - may not reach their destination on time because the state's deadlines are too tight for its ""delivery standards"". USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall said a ""mismatch"" between Pennsylvania's laws and the mail system's delivery capabilities ""creates a risk that ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as we understand them"". How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes The letter was made public on Thursday as Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar asked the state's supreme court to allow ballots to be counted as long as they were received up to three days after the election. Currently, votes are discarded if they are received after election day. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, which Mr Trump won by less than 1% in the 2016 election. Other battleground states, including Florida and Michigan, also received letters, according to US media reports. The Democratic governor in Pennsylvania's neighbouring New Jersey announced on Friday that the state would pre-emptively send ballots to every registered voter in the state. The process of sending out ballots is known as universal mail-in voting, and has been adopted in nine other US states. By David Willis, BBC North America correspondent American voters have been here before of course. In the year 2000, the entire US presidential election result was decided by a few hundred contested votes in the state of Florida, after ballots were scrutinised and sometimes rejected, and the process dragged on for weeks. President Trump has said he wants a clear result on election night, not a contest that drags on through the courts. But by blocking the allocation of badly needed funding to the beleaguered US postal service, Mr Trump is potentially paving the way to a series of drawn-out legal battles that could stretch on for weeks. According to reports here, conservative groups are marshalling a massive legal effort aimed not only at limiting the allocating of postal ballots, but challenging results that prove unfavourable to them on election night. In possibly the harshest criticism of his successor to date, Barack Obama has accused Donald Trump of attempting to ""kneecap"" the US postal service in order to discourage people from voting, while Mr Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden has accused the man he is seeking to replace of launching an ""assault on democracy"". Critics say changes made by the new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy - a major Republican donor - like clamping down on overtime and halting late delivery trips have led to an increase in mail waiting times. But Mr Trump told Fox News he was blocking additional funding for the financially troubled agency, because he opposes mail-in voting. ""Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" he said. ""Now, if we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting, they just can't have it."" Amid the funding controversy, the 300,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers union on Friday endorsed Mr Biden, warning that the ""very survival"" of the USPS was at stake. Mr Trump's campaign has not yet responded. Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

'Miel Gibson' honey lands entrepreneur in hot water,"The Chilean honey featured an image of Mel Gibson in the 1995 film Braveheart Yohanna Agurto thought she had come up with the perfect marketing for her honey, featuring a pun on the name of one of Hollywood's biggest stars: Miel (Spanish for honey) Gibson. The product also carried an image of the actor from the film Braveheart. And it was all going to plan - ""until I received threats from Mel's lawyers"", the Chilean vendor revealed on Twitter. His representatives had issued a cease and desist notice over the unauthorised use of his name and likeness. The letter threatened legal action if Ms Agurto, who began selling the honey after she was left unemployed by the pandemic, failed to withdraw her product immediately, according to news agency Reuters. ""You need to get permission to use or duplicate a photo still from a film, which is owned by the respective studio that released the film,"" lawyer Leigh Brecheen, whose office issued the notice, told the agency. ""None of this is meant to prevent anyone from earning an income or creating a business, but there are proper channels to contact and clearances you need to go through to make sure you have the approval for such usage."" The company appealed to Gibson on Twitter for permission to use his image, adding: ""Our honey is only for brave hearts."" Miel Gibson's plea was liked and retweeted thousands of times, although the actor himself does not appear to have responded. But Ms Agurto is not ready to give up, with the company Twitter account thanking people for the support it has gathered. ""My heart is brave, but now even more so because I know we are a powerful swarm,"" it said.

Baltic states call for new Belarus election,"Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Thousands of people have gathered outside the state television station in Belarus demanding full coverage of protests against the disputed presidential election. Opposition supporters outside the building in Minsk held banners with signs saying ""show people the truth"". Mass protests erupted after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in the 9 August vote. The state broadcaster initially chose not to cover the protests. The election result has been condemned with widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. This video can not be played Protesters chant anti-government slogans in a show of defiance On election day, Belarusian state channels aired the voices of Lukashenko supporters and did not cover the demonstrations. State TV later showed footage of violence to blame protesters and warn people not to participate. Several journalists have resigned over the coverage. On Friday, European Union foreign ministers agreed to prepare new sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for ""falsification"". The US has also condemned the election as ""not free and fair"". And on Saturday, three Baltic states called for the vote to be re-run. Some 100 staff came out of the state television building to join the protests and said they planned a strike on Monday, AFP news agency reports. Others have signed a letter in support of a strike. ""Like everyone we are demanding free elections and the release of those detained at mass protests,"" one employee, Andrei Yaroshevich, told AFP. Mr Lukashenko's press secretary Natalya Eismont and senate speaker Natalya Kochanova arrived at the broadcast centre to meet staff, to shouts of ""shame"" from the crowd gathered outside. This video can not be played Sergiy says riot police in Belarus threatened to burn him alive Earlier on Saturday, thousands of people waved flags, lit candles and laid flowers at the scene close to the metro station where one of the protesters, Alexander Taraikovsky, died on Monday. Others held up pictures of injured protesters, while drivers joined in by honking their horns. Many opposition supporters chanted ""Leave!"" - a call for President Lukashenko to resign - and some carried signs with slogans against police violence. The circumstances of Mr Taraikovsky's death are unclear. Officials say he died when an explosive device went off in his hand during a protest, but opposition supporters dispute this. His partner, Elena German, told the Associated Press news agency that she believed the 34-year-old was shot by police. On Friday, Ms German visited the mortuary where Mr Taraikovsky's body was held. People laid flowers and waved banners near to a metro station where a protester died ""There is a seam in the chest area - the hole was sewn up, but there is a black bruise; it's small but we noticed. His hands and feet are completely intact, there are not even bruises,"" she said. Mr Taraikovsky had worked hard at his automobile repair business, Ms German said, and that neither of them had shown an interest in politics until the presidential election when they decided to support Ms Tikhanovskaya. Analysis by Will Vernon, BBC News, Minsk There has been a clear shift in mood here. Earlier in the week, police with batons beat anyone who dared to come out on the street in the evening. But following widespread strike action in some of Belarus' largest factories, people have been emboldened to come out in greater numbers in the daytime. On Friday, workers from the famous Minsk Tractor Factory joined thousands of protesters in a spontaneous march and rally on Independence Square in Minsk. Such scenes would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago - in a country where, in normal times, any opposition to President Lukashenko is brutally repressed. One woman told us: ""We're sure everything will change. We believe in our victory. That's why we will come to the streets every day. Every day!"" A ""March for Freedom"" is also planned in the centre of the city on Sunday, a week after the contested election. It follows Ms Tikhanovskaya's call for further peaceful rallies across the country on Friday. ""Don't stay on the sidelines,"" she said. This video can not be played 'Human life is the most precious thing': Svetlana Tikhanovskaya speaks out from exile Amid the unrest, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. In a joint statement on Saturday, the prime ministers of three Baltic republics - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - ""expressed deep concern at the violent crackdown... and the political repression of the opposition by the authorities"". Lithuania and Latvia have also previously said they are prepared to mediate in Belarus, provided the authorities stopped violence against protesters and formed a national council with members of civil society. They warned that the alternative was sanctions. The leaders said the presidential election was ""neither free nor fair"" and called for a ""transparent"" vote ""with the participation of international observers"". ""The prime ministers urge the Belarusian authorities to refrain from violence against peaceful demonstrators [and to] release all political prisoners and those that have been detained,"" the statement added. Ms Tikhanovskaya left for Lithuania following the election after she publicly denounced the results. She had sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the vote. Some 6,700 people were arrested in the wake of the election, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of the security services. Amnesty International said accounts from released detainees suggested ""widespread torture"".

Thousands in final rush to beat France quarantineHolidaymakers had just hours to return to the UK to avoid the 14-day self-isolation requirement.UK,"Thousands of British holidaymakers have made a last-minute dash to get home before a 14-day quarantine requirement came into force for people arriving from France. The isolation measure also applies to the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba, amid concerns about a rising numbers of Covid cases. Eurotunnel trains sold out and air fares were up to six times more than normal, but ferries increased capacity. France warned of ""reciprocal measures"". The Netherlandsadvised against all but essential travel to the UK,externalonce the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but said it would not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. I'm in France right now - what do I do? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge There were reported to be about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France when the changes were announced, and the deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Kim Wells and his family were on one of the last ferries to arrive in the UK before the quarantine measures began - getting in to Newhaven from Dieppe in northern France with eight minutes to spare. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had a ""pretty fraught 40 minutes"" online after hearing of the restrictions through a BBC News alert. ""I ended up booking a ferry on a pretty unfashionable route... it was impossible to get back on Eurotunnel, which was the way we went to France originally,"" he said. Mr Wells is a teacher and his wife is a local government worker. They felt they should cut their holiday short to avoid having to quarantine as they are key workers. This video can not be played British holidaymaker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Mr Wells said he was frustrated by the short notice the government had given for the rule change, adding: ""I completely understand the decision, but I think 30 hours' notice and announcing it at 11 o'clock in the evening French time... was pretty unrealistic. ""I don't really understand why they can't be a little bit more clear with the public about what the tipping point is, when we might perhaps be approaching the need to quarantine. Why not 48 or even 72 [hours] just to allow those who need to or want to get home, get home without rushing dangerously."" This video can not be played BBC journalist made a video diary as her family had to cut short their holiday Kate Mooney and her family arrived back at their home in Cornwall at about 01:00 BST after ending their holiday to France a week early. ""Our immediate response was 'let's just stay and finish our holiday', and then we started to really consider what quarantine meant,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""There would be no way we could leave the house... that's when we decided we would come back."" Kate Mooney and her family cut their holiday short by a week Tom Duffell, who runs a small business and ended his family holiday in Nice four days early, told the BBC that social distancing had ""gone out of the window"" in the scramble for transport, with ""huge queues"" at the airport. Eurotunnel, which increased its capacity, said 12,000 people had tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced - at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the deadline. Additional staff were sent to the terminals to allow 11,600 vehicles to quickly load its shuttles throughout Friday. P&O Ferries and DFDS Ferries also added an extra four departures. Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK Meanwhile, a group of musicians from Scotland found a creative way to beat the deadline with just 10 minutes to spare - bychartering a fishing boatto get them back to the UK. After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Some were unable to get back home in time. One passenger arriving at Gatwick soon after the deadline had passed told BBC Radio 4: ""It's ridiculous. They're leaving us high and dry. We tried to change our flights... impossible. ""Me and the kids have been to Cornwall and the Lake District this summer and I don't think that felt any more at risk than where we've been - in a fairly rural part of France."" Another said: ""It's a shame to have missed it by such a narrow margin but that's life really, so we've just got to get on with it."" Chloe McCardel pictured on an earlier endurance swim One woman is wondering whether her unusual journey from France to Britain later today will fall foul of the travel rules. Australian Chloe McCardel, 35, is aiming to complete her 35th endurance swim across the Channel. If she's successful, she will beat the current men's record for the most Channel crossings, held by British athlete Kevin Murphy. She is due to leave Dover at 20:00 BST and aims to make the 21-mile crossing to Calais in about 10 hours, before heading back to her support boat for the return journey. Since she will only stand on French soil for a matter of minutes, McCardel hopes it won't be necessary to spend 14 days in self-isolation on her return. ""We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,"" she said. ""I've got a little celebration planned in England with the support crew, the team, the volunteers who have been so supportive throughout this. So I am hoping the government allow us to do that without having to quarantine."" Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said the UK was lagging behind other countries that had ""shunned quarantines"" in favour of ""comprehensive"" testing programmes for everyone departing and arriving back into their respective countries. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said that while Labour supported ""evidence-based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" put in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. He added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine.""

Japan marks 75 years since end of WWII,"Emperor Naruhito spoke at a memorial event in Tokyo on Saturday Japan's Emperor Naruhito has expressed ""deep remorse"" over his country's actions during World War Two, on the 75th anniversary of its surrender. ""I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never again be repeated,"" he said at a ceremony on Saturday. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised to ""never repeat the tragedy"". The PM marked the occasion by sending an offering to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, but did not visit in person. However, four ministers did visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in a move that is likely to anger China and South Korea. VJ Day celebrations 75 years ago A WW2 hero and a reckoning with Japan's past How a Belfast doctor used Irish to keep WW2 secrets It is the first time in four years such senior politicians have attended the shrine, which pays homage to a number of senior figures convicted of war crimes as well as the country's war dead. ""I paid respects... to the souls of those who nobly sacrificed themselves during the war,"" Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda explained to reporters. Social distancing measures were in place at the Yasukuni Shrine because of the Covid-19 pandemic Emperor Naruhito delivered a short speech at a memorial service in Tokyo, which was scaled back due to the coronavirus pandemic. About 500 people were in attendance compared to more than 6,000 last year and face masks were compulsory. ""Looking back on the long period of post-war peace, reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never again be repeated,"" he said at the event. Naruhito, 60, began his reign in May last year after his father, Emperor Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate the throne in more than 200 years. The memorial event on Saturday was scaled back because of coronavirus South Korea's President Moon Jae-in did not mention the controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in remarks made on Saturday. President Moon instead used the occasion - known as Liberation Day in South Korea - to say his government was prepared to sit down for face to face talks over historical disputes at any time. Seoul and Tokyo are divided over compensation demands for Koreans forced to work under the Japanese occupation, which began in 1910 and ended in 1945. Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine is home to the spirits of Japan's 2.5 million war dead. This morning, despite 36 degree heat and Covid-19, thousands of ordinary people lined up to pay their respects. But the Yasukuni Shrine also honours 14 of Japan's wartime leaders, men who were later convicted as class A war criminals. Any visit to the shrine by a senior Japanese politician is considered highly offensive in Korea and China. This video can not be played Shinzo Abe's visit will make relations with China worse, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes For that reason, Japan's emperor never visits the shrine, and today's official commemorations are being held elsewhere. But four senior members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet did go to Yasukuni this morning, and Mr Abe himself sent a ritual offering. That will reinforce the view in Beijing and Seoul that 75 years after the war ended, Japan's ruling elite is still less than sincere in its remorse for this country's wartime aggression. Japan entered World War Two in September 1940. It drew the US into the war at the end of 1941, after attacking its naval base at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. By the end of the war more than 100,000 Americans and 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war, had died in the Pacific. Millions more died during the Japanese occupation of China and South Korea. Victory in Europe (VE) Day took place on 8 May 1945 following Germany's surrender, but the war continued in the Asia-Pacific region for months. Bells toll to mark 75 years since Hiroshima bomb The day Michiko nearly missed her train Following the end of the fighting in Europe, the Allies told Japan to surrender on 26 July 1945, but the deadline passed without them doing this. The war was brought to an end shortly after the US dropped nuclear bombs over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945. On 15 August, Japanese Emperor Hirohito was heard on the radio for the first time and announced an end to the fighting. The country's official surrender was signed on 2 September that same year.

Thousands in final rush to beat France quarantine,"Thousands of British holidaymakers have made a last-minute dash to get home before a 14-day quarantine requirement came into force for people arriving from France. The isolation measure also applies to the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba, amid concerns about a rising numbers of Covid cases. Eurotunnel trains sold out and air fares were up to six times more than normal, but ferries increased capacity. France warned of ""reciprocal measures"". The Netherlandsadvised against all but essential travel to the UK,externalonce the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but said it would not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. I'm in France right now - what do I do? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge There were reported to be about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France when the changes were announced, and the deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Kim Wells and his family were on one of the last ferries to arrive in the UK before the quarantine measures began - getting in to Newhaven from Dieppe in northern France with eight minutes to spare. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had a ""pretty fraught 40 minutes"" online after hearing of the restrictions through a BBC News alert. ""I ended up booking a ferry on a pretty unfashionable route... it was impossible to get back on Eurotunnel, which was the way we went to France originally,"" he said. Mr Wells is a teacher and his wife is a local government worker. They felt they should cut their holiday short to avoid having to quarantine as they are key workers. This video can not be played British holidaymaker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Mr Wells said he was frustrated by the short notice the government had given for the rule change, adding: ""I completely understand the decision, but I think 30 hours' notice and announcing it at 11 o'clock in the evening French time... was pretty unrealistic. ""I don't really understand why they can't be a little bit more clear with the public about what the tipping point is, when we might perhaps be approaching the need to quarantine. Why not 48 or even 72 [hours] just to allow those who need to or want to get home, get home without rushing dangerously."" This video can not be played BBC journalist made a video diary as her family had to cut short their holiday Kate Mooney and her family arrived back at their home in Cornwall at about 01:00 BST after ending their holiday to France a week early. ""Our immediate response was 'let's just stay and finish our holiday', and then we started to really consider what quarantine meant,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""There would be no way we could leave the house... that's when we decided we would come back."" Kate Mooney and her family cut their holiday short by a week Tom Duffell, who runs a small business and ended his family holiday in Nice four days early, told the BBC that social distancing had ""gone out of the window"" in the scramble for transport, with ""huge queues"" at the airport. Eurotunnel, which increased its capacity, said 12,000 people had tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced - at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the deadline. Additional staff were sent to the terminals to allow 11,600 vehicles to quickly load its shuttles throughout Friday. P&O Ferries and DFDS Ferries also added an extra four departures. Musicians from Dunedin Consort hired a fishing boat to return to the UK Meanwhile, a group of musicians from Scotland found a creative way to beat the deadline with just 10 minutes to spare - bychartering a fishing boatto get them back to the UK. After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Some were unable to get back home in time. One passenger arriving at Gatwick soon after the deadline had passed told BBC Radio 4: ""It's ridiculous. They're leaving us high and dry. We tried to change our flights... impossible. ""Me and the kids have been to Cornwall and the Lake District this summer and I don't think that felt any more at risk than where we've been - in a fairly rural part of France."" Another said: ""It's a shame to have missed it by such a narrow margin but that's life really, so we've just got to get on with it."" Chloe McCardel pictured on an earlier endurance swim One woman is wondering whether her unusual journey from France to Britain later today will fall foul of the travel rules. Australian Chloe McCardel, 35, is aiming to complete her 35th endurance swim across the Channel. If she's successful, she will beat the current men's record for the most Channel crossings, held by British athlete Kevin Murphy. She is due to leave Dover at 20:00 BST and aims to make the 21-mile crossing to Calais in about 10 hours, before heading back to her support boat for the return journey. Since she will only stand on French soil for a matter of minutes, McCardel hopes it won't be necessary to spend 14 days in self-isolation on her return. ""We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,"" she said. ""I've got a little celebration planned in England with the support crew, the team, the volunteers who have been so supportive throughout this. So I am hoping the government allow us to do that without having to quarantine."" Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said the UK was lagging behind other countries that had ""shunned quarantines"" in favour of ""comprehensive"" testing programmes for everyone departing and arriving back into their respective countries. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said that while Labour supported ""evidence-based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" put in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. He added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine.""

On Friday, France reported 2,846 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours - the highest number since lockdown restrictions were eased. The seven-day average increased to 2,041, marking the first time it has surpassed 2,000 since 20 April, a 66% week-on-week rise. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%.

UK commemorates 75th anniversary of VJ DaySenior royals are leading tributes to mark the day World War Two ended with the surrender of Japan.UK,"This video can not be played A service of remembrance was held at the National Memorial Arboretum The Royal Family has led the UK's commemorations on the 75th anniversary of VJ Day - the day World War Two ended with Japan's surrender. The Prince of Wales led a two-minute silence at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, as part of a service of remembrance. Later, in a TV address, his elder son Prince William urged the public ""to learn the lessons of the past"". And a message from the Queen thanked those ""who fought so valiantly"". She said: ""Those of us who remember the conclusion of the Far East campaign, whether on active service overseas, or waiting for news at home, will never forget the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief."" The Prince of Wales attended the event at the arboretum with the Duchess of Cornwall. He laid a wreath at the Kwai Railway Memorial, as a small number of veterans and their relatives sat on benches dotted around the garden, to maintain social distancing. A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast also commemorated those who fought. In a speech, Prince Charles said the veterans' service ""will echo through the ages."" He referred to the description of them as the Forgotten Army, noting how many soldiers, nurses and other personnel felt aggrieved at the way some of the public associated the end of World War Two with the victory in Europe in May 1945. ""Let us affirm, they and serving veterans are not forgotten, rather you are respected, thanked and cherished with all our hearts and for all time,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who also attended and read the poem The Exhortation before the silence, thanked those who had fought for restoring ""peace and prosperity"". Boris Johnson laid a wreath and read the war poem Exhortation - saying ""they shall grow not old"" This video can not be played Prince William: ""Your bravery, and the sacrifices you made, will never be forgotten"" In a pre-recorded speech for BBC One's VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute - broadcast on Saturday evening - the Duke of Cambridge spoke of how King George VI addressed the nation on August 15 1945 as ""the most catastrophic conflict in mankind's history came to an end"". ""It is hard for us to imagine what Victory over Japan Day must have felt like at the time; a mix of happiness, jubilation, and sheer relief, together with a deep sadness and overwhelming sense of loss for those who would never return home. ""Today we remember those who endured terrible suffering and honour all those who lost their lives."" He cautioned: ""As we look back, we must not forget our responsibility to learn the lessons of the past and ensure that the horrors of the Second World War are never repeated. ""We owe that to our veterans, to their families, and to the generations who will come after us. He went on to thank those veterans, among them his own grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who ""remembers vividly his role in collecting released prisoners of war"", said Prince William. Prince Philip was a young Royal Navy officer aboard a warship in Tokyo Bay when Japan surrendered. As part of the commemorations, he appeared in a photo montage of veterans which featured on large screens in locations across the country throughout the day. In the montage each veteran was pictured with an image of themselves from their time in service. It marked a rare appearance for Prince Philip, 99, who has only been seen a handful of times in public since retiring in 2017 - most recently for a military event at Windsor Castle. Earlier in the morning, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was joined by military chiefs as he placed a wreath at the Cenotaph in London. The defence secretary also met some of the famous Chelsea Pensioners during his visit to their iconic home, the Royal Hospital Chelsea, as part of events to mark the 75th anniversary. But the Red Arrows - who were due to carry out a flypast over the capital cities of all four nations of the UK - were forced to cancel flights over Edinburgh, Cardiff and London, where they were to fly directly over the Royal Hospital Chelsea, due to poor weather conditions. They were, at least, able to fly over Belfast, and pilots met three veterans during a stop at Prestwick, near Glasgow. The Red Arrows flew over the Titanic slipway and the Titanic Museum in Belfast VJ Day - or Victory over Japan Day - on 15 August 1945 ended one of the worst episodes in British military history, during which tens of thousands of servicemen were forced to endure the brutalities of prisoner of war camps. It is estimated that there were 71,000 British and Commonwealth casualties of the war against Japan, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war who died in Japanese captivity. More than 2.5 million Japanese military personnel and civilians are believed to have died over the course of the conflict. What is VJ Day? VJ Day celebrations 75 years ago Bells toll to mark 75 years since Hiroshima bomb The fighting in Europe had ended in May 1945, but many Allied servicemen were still fighting against Japan in east Asia. Japan rejected an ultimatum for peace, and the US believed that dropping a nuclear bomb would force them to surrender. The US dropped two atomic bombs on Japan on 6 and 9 August, killing an estimated 214,000 people, and within two weeks Japan surrendered. To mark the 75th anniversary,Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offeringto a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, but did not attend in person. However, two of his ministers did visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in which 14 leaders who were later convicted by the Allies as war criminals are commemorated. John Maguire, BBC News The National Memorial Arboretum seems to lend itself perfectly to the concept of a socially distanced commemorative service. Veterans of the Burma campaign, their families, and other guests sat on chairs spaced out on the grass between the trees. The proceedings focused on the multinational and multicultural make up of the Allied forces that fought the Japanese. Gurkhas, alongside Sikhs, sat next to troops from Welsh and Scottish regiments, representing the 40 nations involved in the Far East. After sitar music, readings from British Asian actors, and speeches from descendants of those who fought, the roar of aircraft engines could be heard overhead. A Lancaster, Hurricane and three Spitfires from the Battle of Britain Memorial flew over in formation and in tribute. Then those who could stand, were invited to do so for a two-minute silence. The Prince of Wales then laid a wreath at the Burma Railway Memorial. Flowers had been placed between the sleepers and track that make up the memorial. It was known as the ""Death Railway"" and 16,000 prisoners of war died during its construction. It makes an incongruous, yet incredibly poignant sight among the granite and brass of the other memorials. Boris Johnson earlier joined other world leaders including US President Donald Trump in recording a video message to thank veterans. In the video, each leader says in turn: ""To all who served, we thank you."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (far right) laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning Mr Johnson added: ""On this 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, we pay tribute to the heroes deployed thousands of miles away in the mountains, islands and rainforests of Asia. ""Unable to celebrate the victory in Europe, and among the last to return home, today we recognise the bravery and ingenuity of those who, in the face of adversity, restored peace and prosperity to the world. ""Their immeasurable sacrifice changed the course of history and, at today's commemorations, we take the opportunity to say what should be said every day - thank you."" How a Belfast doctor used Irish to keep WW2 secrets A WW2 hero and a reckoning with Japan's past Daughter of WW2 prisoner of war shares last letter In a letter specifically addressed to Far East veterans, Mr Johnson said: ""You were the last to come home but your achievements are written in the lights of the glittering capitals of the dynamic region we see today."" ""All of us who were born after you have benefitted from your courage in adversity. On this anniversary, and every day hereafter, you will be remembered,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also recorded a message, paying tribute ""to the wartime generation, who through the horrors of conflict showed us the spirit and determination that we need to always remember and always be grateful for"". ""It's important that as we face the challenges of today, we take inspiration from that generation,"" he said. At the 70th anniversary of VJ Day there was a parade in London Meanwhile Capt Sir Tom Moore, who served in the Burma campaign has encouraged the public to join in the commemorations, describing VJ Day as ""the most special day"". ""It was VJ Day when the pain of war could finally start to fall away as peace was declared on all fronts,"" said Sir Tom - who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden during lockdown. ""I respectfully ask Britain to stop whatever it is doing and take some time to remember. ""We must all take the time to stop, think and be thankful that were it not for the ultimate sacrifices made all those years ago by such a brave band of men and women, we would not be enjoying the freedoms we have today, even in these current difficult times."" The service at the National Memorial Arboretum was broadcast on BBC One between 09:30 and 11:30 BST and is available on Iplayer. VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute is broadcast from 20:30 BST.

Thai king commutes beach killers' death sentence,"Hannah Witheridge and David Miller's bodies were found on a beach in Koh Tao in September 2014 Two men given the death penalty for killing two British backpackers in Thailand have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao in 2014. Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo wereconvicted in a Thai court and sentenced to death in December 2015. Lin and Phyo will serve life sentences instead following a royal decree. Ms Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby in Norfolk, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey, were bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Ms Witheridge had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders in a Thai court and sentenced to death Lin and Phyo (also known asÂ Win Zaw Htun)Â were sentenced to death for the murder of Mr Miller and the murder and rape of Ms Witheridge. The two men were convicted and sentenced in 2015 and the verdict was upheld by an appeals court in 2017 and theSupreme Court in August 2019. The convictions were mired in controversy, with supporters of the two men arguing they had been framed because their initial confessions were made under duress. A royal decree said the sentences had been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday on 28 July and to ""illustrate the king's clemency"". It is unclear how many prisoners were eligible for any pardons or reduction of sentences under the different criteria listed in the decree. Correction: An earlier headline on this story referred to the killers being ""pardoned"". This was later changed to clarify that their death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment.

Campaigners 'sceptical' over historic hotel plans,"The 173-bed Exchange Hotel opened in 2017 An investment syndicate and a former councillor hope to reopen Cardiff's historic Coal Exchange as a hotel after the company which owned it collapsed. The stakeholders want to get the business up and running again afterSignature Living Coal Exchange was put into liquidation, owing about Â£25m. The Grade II*-listed building reopened as the Exchange Hotel in 2017 after a Â£40m renovation. Heritage campaigners said they were ""sceptical"" about the plans. Built in 1883, the Coal Exchange was once where the world price of coal was setand where it is claimed the first Â£1m cheque was signed. Former Cardiff councillor Ashley Govier, who runs a hotel services company which supplied staff to the Exchange, has applied to renew its alcohol and live events licence. The new application was submitted by Eden Grove Properties Limited, another of Mr Govier's companies. Mr Govier said he was paying salaries of 61 hotel staff and hoped to secure their jobs. ""We stepped in to keep the staff pool on while we try to get the hotel open again. Our intention is to save as many staff as possible,"" he said. Council's Â£2m loan for controversial hotel revamp Historic hotel owners go into administration Mr Govier is working with Coal Exchange Hotel LLP, a syndicate of about 30 investors who hold a 999-year ground lease on most of the communal areas of the Coal Exchange and about 60 bedrooms. The remaining bedrooms at the hotel are leased by individual investors, who were promised quarterly dividends as a return on their investments. The trading floor of the Coal Exchange at its peak Philip Ingman, who manages the syndicate, said it had invested more than Â£15m to fund the first phase of converting the building into a hotel. ""Our investors' aim is of course to get the works finished and prepare the hotel to open again,"" he said. Another stakeholder is businessman Derek Watts, whose company Albendan Ltd is one of the largest creditors of the collapsed company, with a debt of about Â£10m. Cardiff Council said the consultation period for Eden Grove Properties Ltd's application ends on 28 August. Much of the building remains covered in scaffolding and it will cost an estimated Â£8m to complete the renovation. Nerys Lloyd-Pierce of Cardiff Civic Society said: ""Our fear is that the Coal Exchange will become the victim of 'facadism', where the heart and soul of the building will be lost."" Nick Russell of Save the Coal Exchange said the attempts to reopen the hotel were ""encouraging"", but that concerns remained for its longer-term future. The Coal Exchange - a short history Coal merchants, ship owners and their agents met daily on the trading floor At one time the price of the world's coal was determined there and in 1904 the world's first recorded Â£1m deal was struck there Closed in 1958 after the decline of the coal industry in Cardiff Earmarked as a future home for the Welsh assembly, but that plan fell through after devolution was rejected in a 1979 referendum In more recent years it has been used for concerts, dinners and other events There were once plans for the exchange hall to be restored and a 1,300-seat banqueting hall, public square, office space and innovation centre to be developed Calls to save 'shamefully neglected' Coal Exchange Council's Â£2m loan for controversial hotel revamp Historic hotel owners go into administration Coal Exchange reopens after Â£40m revamp Cardiff Council 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Today's coverage was brought to you by Robert Greenall, Joshua Nevett, George Wright, Joseph Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Thomas Spender and Emma Owen. Weâll be back again with more live updates from the UK and around the world. To refresh your memory, here is a summary of todayâs top stories: Simon JonesReporter, BBC South East British holidaymakers were scrambling to get home after the quarantine rule was announced Eurotunnel says it carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the UK's quarantine deadline for people arriving from France. British holidaymakers were in a rush to return to the UK before the quarantine began at 04:00 BST on Saturday. The day was already one of the busiest of the year and, despite the already heavy traffic, Eurotunnel managed to get more tourists through urgently. The Shuttle increased its capacity for the day by 30% by adding 22 additional departures and carrying more than 30,000 passengers during the day. Additional teams came to the terminals to allow the 11,600 vehicles to quickly load the Shuttles. Passengers were able to travel in complete safety, remaining in their personal vehicles throughout the journey, without any contact with either another passenger or a member of staff. âIt is thanks to our teams, their commitment and their professionalism that we were able to meet the expectations of our customers yesterday and make this remarkable collective effort a success,"" Yann Leriche, CEO of Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said. The FDA has added more ineffective sanitisers to its do-not-use list Throughout the pandemic, health officials have been urging us to keep our hands clean. Why? To kill particles of coronavirus to prevent it from spreading. Hand sanitisers are one way to do so, but not all of them are effective, as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has repeatedly warned. This week,the FDA expanded the list of products,externalit advises people not to use to about 100 brands and 150 varieties. Of the new products added to the list, 20 were sanitisers that didnât contain enough alcohol to be effective. To kill the virus, hand sanitisers must contain a sufficient amount of alcohol, at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. They must also be safe to use on the skin. The Cavern Club in Liverpool, best known for launching The Beatles, says it is facing a fight for its survival as a result of the pandemic. The venue usually hosts about 800,000 visitors a year but one of its directors, Bill Heckle, said it had lost Â£30,000 a week since the lockdown began in March. He said: ""We went five months before unfortunately we had to make about 20 people redundant."" The Cavern is reopening for virtual sets by music bands from around the world later in August. But its survival depends on a bid to the government's cultural recovery fund, a Liverpool City Council spokesperson said. The city's mayor Joe Anderson said: ""Liverpool City Council is doing all it can to help our venues but we can only do so much, given how much financial pressure we are under supporting the most vulnerable in our communities.""

Mallorca is popular with Germans German Health Minister Jens Spahn has criticised ""party holidays"" in Spain as he defended a decision to designate most of the country a virus risk region. ""I know how much the Germans love Spain... But
unfortunately the infection rates there are rising sharply, too
sharply,"" Jens Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""Whoever goes to Spain despite the warning should protect
themselves and others while on holiday. Party holidays are
irresponsible in this pandemic."" Those returning from risk regions - which include the island of Mallorca, popular with German tourists - must take a coronavirus test or quarantine for 14 days. There are about 30,000 Germans on tour-operator holidays in the Balearic islands, most in Mallorca, plus more independent tourists, the German travel association said. Bar owners in Mallorca told Reuters they feared for their businesses' future. ""We live in fear here. We don't know what tomorrow will
bring,"" said Gelinde from Munich who owns Casa Baviera bar. Germany's confirmed coronavirus
cases were up 1,415 to 222,828, according to the Robert Koch
Institute for infectious diseases - the biggest increase since late April. Infections in Spain have also spiked in recent days. The UK government says another 1,012 people have tested positive for coronavirus. Saturday is the fifth day in a row that more than 1,000 cases have been recorded in the country. The total number of positive tests now stands at 317,379. A further three people have died within 28 days of a positive test. A further 4,293 coronavirus infections have been reported in Iraq, the biggest rise in new cases since the pandemic began, health authorities say. Iraqâs health ministry said the country had now recorded 172,583 cases in total, the third-highest number in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia and Iran. The health ministry also reported 76 fatalities, raising the countryâs death toll to 5,785. Iraq has been grappling with the disease since February, but cases have been surging recently after dipping off at the start of August. The country's health system has been struggling to cope with the outbreak after years of war and neglect. The video below highlights the heavy toll coronavirus has taken on the country's hospitals and cemeteries.

After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire just before the restrictions came into force at 04:00 BST. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. It was the first concert by the baroque ensemble since lockdown began in March. Jo Buckley, the Dunedin Consort's chief executive, told BBC Scotland they knew quarantine was a risk as they travelled to France on Wednesday. But after four months in lockdown, the musicians were desperate to play together again. Read more here. Dr Anthony Fauci has become the face of the US's coronavirus response Deaths linked to coronavirus âwould be enormous and totally unacceptableâ if the US were to pursue a strategy of herd immunity, the countryâs top diseases expert has said. Herd immunity is the point at which a population has developed protection against a disease. There are two ways to do this - mass infection or vaccination. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said if everyone contracted the disease âa lot of people are going to dieâ. ""You look at the United States of America, with our epidemic of obesity as it were. With the number of people with hypertension. With the number of people with diabetes. If everyone got infected, the death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable,""Dr Fauci said in an Instagram interview,external. The herd-immunity strategy was said to have been considered by some governments, including the UKâs, early on in the pandemic. But estimates of the loss of life and the heavy burden on hospitals led to criticism of the strategy. ""As has been reported in the media this morning I am on a pre-arranged family holiday in Italy,"" wrote Crawley With a tourism industry that has been badly damaged in the pandemic, the Republic of Ireland was encouraging people to avoid non-essential travel abroad and enjoy a holiday at home. Meanwhile, the chairman of the country's national tourism authority is taking a break in Italy. FÃ¡ilte Ireland's Michael Cawleysent his resignation within hours of his trip being reportedin the media this morning. He said he was on a ""pre-arranged family holiday"" and resigned with ""great regret"". Tourism Minister Catherine Martin said she was ""disappointed to learn that the chair of FÃ¡ilte Ireland was holidaying in Italy"". She said that although Italy was on Ireland's ""green list"" of countries from which returning travellers do not have to restrict their movements, many other citizens had followed the guidance to avoid non-essential travel ""at some personal and financial cost to themselves"". New Zealand health authorities are yet to establish the source of the latest outbreak New Zealand authorities are investigating a possible link between the countryâs new coronavirus outbreak and Covid-19 infections in the Australian state of Victoria. The countryâs director of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said on Saturday he had been in contact with health officials in Victoria about cases connected to US-based company Americold. Workers at Americoldâs cold-storage facilities in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia have tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Bloomfield said testing was under way on employees in Melbourne to see if there were any connections with the cases in Auckland. ""We're looking at that possibility, it's part of the overall puzzle and we are leaving no stone unturned,"" Dr Bloomfield said. But Americoldâs chief executive for Australia and New Zealand, Richard Winnall, dismissed Dr Bloomfield's suggestion. Winnall said the âsite at Melbourne has never shipped any freight to the [company's] Mt Wellington [Auckland] facility, according to our records"". New Zealand health officials are scrambling to find the source of the outbreak that resulted in restrictions being tightened again this week. There are now 37 cases linked to the latest outbreak, after seven more infections were recorded on Saturday. Facemasks will be compulsory on public transport in Denmark from 22 August, the prime minister has announced. Mette Frederiksen urged Danes to remain vigilant and respect social distancing measures. Tyra Grove Krause, an official from the infectious diseases control authority, said: ""We have witnessed a rise in the number of people infected in Denmark, with several local clusters."" ""Some (outbreaks) are under control and others are about to be."" Denmark has escaped the worst of the pandemic in comparison to some European countries, with a death toll of 621. Okobaba Destitute Home houses some of the most vulnerable people in Nigeria. Thatâs why the threat of Covid-19 is such a serious concern to its residents, many of whom have fled instability in the countryâs north. âWeâre scared because we have children, the elderly, and those with underlying health issues,â one resident, Suraju Saleh, told BBC Africa. No one in the community has been infected with the virus yet, but if there is an outbreak, Suraju fears âit may get out of handâ. Watch our video below to see how residents of Okobaba Destitute Home in Lagos are coping during the pandemic. This video can not be played Nigeria: Lagos's vulnerable people struggle to cope with Covid-19 One more person has died in Walesafter a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 1,587. Public Health Wales said 27 new cases were recorded over the last 24 hours. In Scotland another 51 positive tests were recorded, with 25 in the NHS Grampian area that includes the city of Aberdeen. The city is now in its second week of local lockdown measures as health officials try to control a significant outbreak. There were no new deaths in Scotland, leaving the toll there at 2,491. Chloe McCardel, pictured on an earlier endurance swim, is hoping to break a record with her 35th Channel crossing In the early hours of this morning, Britons were rushing back from France to avoid newly imposed UK quarantine restrictions. Now one woman is left wondering if her unusual journey later today will fall foul of the travel rules. Australian Chloe McCardel, 35, is aiming to complete her 35th endurance swim across the Channel. If she's successful, she will beat the current men's record for the most Channel crossings, held by British athlete Kevin Murphy. She is due to leave Dover at 20:00 BST today and aims to make the 21-mile crossing to Calais in about ten hours, before heading back to her support boat for the return journey. Since she will only stand on French soil for a matter of minutes, McCardel hopes it won't be necessary to spend 14 days in self-isolation on her return. âWe donât go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so Iâm hoping technically the quarantine thing wonât apply,"" she said. âIâve got a little celebration planned in England with the support crew, the team, the volunteers who have been so supportive throughout this. So I am hoping the government allow us to do that without having to quarantine.â Ukraine has recorded 1,847 new
coronavirus cases, a new daily record for cases in the country. The figure from the National Council of Security and Defence is higher than the previous record set on Friday of 1,732 new cases. Infections have been on the rise since June when the authorities eased some restrictions and allowed cafes, churches and public transport
to reopen. The country has now logged a total of 89,719 cases including 2,044 deaths. George Murray spent 15 years living on the UK's streets. He always refused any offers of shelter - even during incredibly cold winter periods. So staff at one hotel offering emergency accommodation during the pandemic were amazed when he showed up at their door. From there, he has made the move into settled housing. The 49-year-old now spends evenings watching TV in his own ""brilliant"" flat. ""I've become a bit of a Star Trek fan,"" he says. Read more of George's story here Residents are tested in Danang Vietnam - which had not seen a single Covid-19 fatality until the end of July - has recorded two more deaths, bringing its total to 23. The country has also reported 21 new infections, bringing the total to 950. About half of the cases are linked to the central city of Danang, where an outbreak started last month. It is so far unclear how the outbreak began. Around 80,000 visitors in Danang - many of whom had relaxed into thinking the disease was contained - were flown home promptly after the new cases emerged and the historic port city sealed itself off from visitors and retreated into full lockdown. Read more about the Danang outbreak here Readers in the UK will likely know that A-level students were given their grades on Thursday - even though they weren't able to sit any exams. The process the government used to come up with them is complicated -you can brush up on it here. Now one student who was rejected by her chosen university as the results she was given weren't good enough, has told the UK's schools minister that he ""ruined my life"". Speaking on a BBC radio programme,Nina told Nick Gibb her marks were three grades lower than predicted and that she was distraught. The government has said it will cover the cost of appealing after 280,000 students had their marks downgraded. Crime in South Africa dropped by up to 40% during the first three months of its lockdown, official figures show. Police Minister Bheki Cele said most types of crimes went down between April and June - including sexual assault and arson. The figures ""paint a never-seen-before rosy picture"" of a peaceful South Africa experiencing a ""crime holiday"", he said. He added that a controversial alcohol ban during the coronavirus lockdown had helped, but that attacks on liquor stores had increased in the pandemic. South Africa has among the world's highest crime rates. It has also recorded over half the Covid-19 cases in Africa - but observers say this may be because it has better testing than other countries.

Coronavirus cases stable across most of EnglandA survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests fewer than 0.05% of the population has the virus.HealthComments,"Coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, despite flare-ups in local hotspots, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). An estimated 1 in 1,900, or 28,300 people in England currently have the virus. The ONS said evidence of a ""small increase"" in people testing positive in July has now stabilised. It has been regularly testing people in private households since April. The ONS survey provides a consistent picture of what's been happening, because it regularly tests a large group of people - whether they have symptoms or not. That means any changes are down to fewer or more infections, not just because more testing is taking place. In areas where there have been spikes, more testing takes place. Looking at the government's figures, this can make it look like cases are rising, when in fact more are simply being uncovered. ALockdown: What can I do now? Visiting people at home banned in parts of England On the other hand, the relatively small number of people involved in the survey means the conclusions are based on 58 positive tests out of 122,000 swabs in the past six weeks. But the ONS takes this uncertainty into account and even, with a margin of error, believes cases are levelling off. Virus cases 'may be levelling off' in England Public Health England, which does look at confirmed cases along with other measures, said the majority of indicators suggested ""Covid-19 activity remained stable at a national level"". But there was a rise in cases being identified and general ""increases in activity"" in the North West, Yorkshire and Humber and the East Midlands. The area with the most cases per 100,000 people was Pendle, followed by Oldham, Blackburn and Bradford. But in Blackburn, cases are now falling - as they are in Leicester and Calderdale, the next most affected areas.

Enter a full UK postcode, English, Welsh or Northern Irish council name, or Scottish health board name to find out If you can't see the look-up click here.,external The government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) believes the virus's reproduction or R number is at or below one, indicating the virus is stable or slightly falling. The Covid Symptom Study app run by company ZOE and researchers at King's College London shows a similar picture. It estimates 22,702 people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. Symptom study figures, which are slightly more up to date than ONS figures, also show a rise in cases in July which then tailed off and have since fallen. The government's figures on ""confirmed cases"" - which just look at positive tests, but don't adjust for more tests being done - look like cases are rising. But there hasn't, yet, been a corresponding rise in hospitalisations or deaths. LOCKDOWN BABIES:How have pregnancies and births changed?
