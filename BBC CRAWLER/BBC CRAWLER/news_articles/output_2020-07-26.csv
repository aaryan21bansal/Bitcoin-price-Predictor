Patel challenges Twitter delay in tackling Wiley,"The home secretary has demanded a ""full explanation"" from Twitter and Instagram on why anti-Semitic posts by rapper Wiley were not removed more quickly. Police are investigating a series of posts on the grime artist's social media accounts. He has been temporarily banned from both Twitter and Instagram. Priti Patel said the posts were anti-Semitic and ""abhorrent"". ""Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms,"" she said. Wiley, 41, known as the ""godfather of grime"", shared conspiracy theories and insulted Jewish people on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which together have more than 940,000 followers.

Twitter removed some of Wiley's tweets with a note saying they violated its rules - but other tweets were still visible 12 hours after being posted. It later said Wiley's account had been locked for seven days. Facebook - which owns Instagram - said on Sunday that the platform had also blocked the rapper from his account for seven days, and that there was ""no place for hate speech on Instagram"". But Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the steps taken by Twitter and Instagram were not enough. In a letter to bosses of the two social media firms,external, he said that when the material was published on their platforms, ""the response - its removal and the banning of those responsible - should be immediate. ""It takes minutes for content shared on your platform to reach an audience of millions. When someone influential shares hate speech, in that time it may have an impact on the views of many who look up to them."" Mr Khan said it was ""particularly disheartening"" when social media had played a ""positive role in amplifying the vital voices"" of the Black Lives Matter movement recently. Facebook to examine racist algorithms Facebook encryption threatens safety - ministers Wiley's series of posts began on Friday night and his manager John Woolf's initial response was that, having known the artist for 12 years,""he does not truly feel this way"",external. But on Saturday, Mr Woolf saidhe had ""cut all ties"" with the London-born rapper,externaland that there was ""no place in society for anti-Semitism"". Wiley first entered the UK singles charts with Wearing My Rolex in 2008. His subsequent hits include Heatwave in 2012 and Boasty in 2019, a collaboration with rappers Stefflon Don and Sean Paul and actor Idris Elba.

Beauty salons and tattooists reopen in Wales,"This video can not be played Customers are back in beauty salons and tattoo parlours - but with protective measures in place Beauty salons and tattooists in Wales are allowed to reopen for the first time since lockdown. The Welsh Government's latest easing of restrictions means nail bars, spas, and tanning shops can open again on Monday. But people will have to wait longer for facials and to get their eyebrows and eyelashes done, with guidelines warning the treatments are ""too high risk"". One salon owner in Vale of Glamorgan said she had missed out on trade during her busiest time of year. And a tattooist in Gwynedd opened at midnight to finish off a woman's tattoo she had started before lockdown. This video can not be played Life is ""horrible"" without his fillers and Botox, Iwan Steffan says Welsh Government guidance,externalhas outlined which businesses can open on Monday, and measures they should put in place, including: Beauty salons, including nail bars and tanning shops, can reopen, but facial treatments are not advised Spas can resume business, but only for beauty treatments and not for saunas and pools Tattooists can resume, but walk-in appointments are not allowed Businesses offering piercing, electrolysis and acupuncture have also given the green light to reopen Hairdressers havebeen able to opensince 13 July. But theWelsh Government guidance has ""strongly advised"",externalbeauticians not to perform facial treatments, due to the high risk of people being face-to-face for long periods of time. This includes eyebrow tinting, waxing and threading, fillers, eyelash treatments, dermaplaning and microblading treatments and makeup. If beauticians choose to perform treatments on clients' faces, they must wear a fluid resistant surgical face mask, goggles, disposable gloves and an apron, and be fully trained in using personal protective equipment (PPE) safely, the guidelines say. The Welsh Government said it had ""worked with public health experts and the beauty industry to develop the guidance and make it is as clear as possible for an industry that covers a huge range of different procedures across a wide variety of settings"". The decision to prohibit facial treatments is based on Public Health Wales guidance, it added. Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, says she has missed out on most of her busiest time of year The owner of a beauty salon said businesses would be trying to make up for a significant loss of income, but predicted some would be unable to open straight away due to receiving the guidance at such short notice. ""Our busiest time of the year is from April to September when we take possibly more than 50% of our annual takings so for us it's been a massive hit on our business,"" said Jayne Goodings, owner of Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty Salon, in Cowbridge. ""The guidance was issued [Friday] and we're due to open on Monday. ""I'm lucky that I've got the measures in place but there could be a lot of salons that haven't and are now trying to source PPE in readiness for Monday."" Ms Goodings added: ""It has been difficult. Sourcing PPE in itself has been a marathon to say the least."" Sarah Bruton said beauty therapists were already well trained in limiting cross-infection Sarah Bruton of Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly says she will now open seven days a week to cope with demand and allow staff to work the same hours but with more space around them. She has introduced perspex screens, hand-sanitising stations and temperature checks, and removed things like fluffy towels and robes. Sarah said: ""We've changed some of our operating processes so we do treatments in a slightly different way and we've procured lots of PPE, so things like aprons, visors and gloves and masks, to make our working practices as safe as possible."" She added: ""We're trained to do things like limit cross-infection and prevent contamination, so we're already very well placed to be able to protect people against Covid."" This video can not be played Jules Lee said tattooists were already ""one of the cleanest places"" Jules Lee opened her tattoo shop in Bangor at midnight. Her first client was a woman whose tattoo was left incomplete when lockdown was announced. Because of the strict hygiene rules governing tattoo shops before the pandemic, Ms Lee said Covid-19 requirements should not be too challenging. ""Tattooists are one of the cleanest places you can be,"" she said. ""There is a need for more PPE - we were already using PPE anyway, but we have to use more now."" Ms Lee finished a tattoo of a rose, inspired by the Disney film Beauty and the Beast, on Louise Pritchard's leg Louise Pritchard, Ms Lee's first customer after reopening, said: ""I have waited for this since Jules had to close, [it] feels like forever. It feels like a lifetime ago. ""I agreed to come at midnight because I've been waiting for ages and I was really looking forward to it. ""I love my ink. I don't like things being half finished and Jules has been great fitting me in, and it is really therapeutic."" Ms Lee said the tattoo, on Ms Pritchard's lower leg, was inspired by the film Beauty and the Beast and was part of a wider piece. ""Louise is a Disney mega fan,"" she said. ""We are working on a Disney-themed leg sleeve for her. ""She's a very loyal client that I've been tattooing for months and she was very eager to get more ink as soon as."" New PPE requirements are the biggest change, Ms Lee says Ms Lee said customers needed to book in advance and must not turn up more than five minutes before their appointment or hang around afterwards. Hand sanitiser will be provided for customers and she will leave an hour between appointments to allow her time to ""deep clean"". After a ""worrying"" time without revenue, Ms Lee said she could not wait to reopen. ""I'm so excited - I just love my job,"" she added.

Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity,"""Buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government's bid to tackle obesity in England. The plan,externalalso includes restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. A ban on junk food adverts before 21:00has been confirmed - for the whole UK. Boris Johnson said the plans would help ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus"". The prime minister has unveiled the strategy amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. How bad is our obesity problem? GPs to prescribe cycling in new obesity strategy Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Has Covid-19 exposed UK's underlying ill health? The other measures being taken are: A national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily after the ""wake-up call"" of coronavirus A consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether A review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops A consultation on making calories labelling on alcohol drinks mandatory Greater incentives for GPs to tackle excess weight, including the use of apps and exercise-on-referral Labelling of calories on menus will apply to any restaurant, cafe or takeaway chain with more than 250 employees, and another new consultation will be launched around plans to provide the same information for alcoholic drinks. The move marks a change in stance by the prime minister, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". This video can not be played Former Labour MP Tom Watson who lost 8 stone, pictured here after and before But Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Writing in the Daily Express, he said: ""We all put things off - I know I have. I've wanted to lose weight for ages and, like many people, I struggle with my weight. ""I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it too, I realised how important it is not to be overweight."" If implemented this will mean radical changes to the way food is marketed. Most of the proposals were first set out in a policy paper in 2018 and put out to consultation before getting stalled. The key is how businesses react this time, having previously been against the measures. The Food and Drink Federation has again given a hostile response. But what about advertisers whose freedom to promote some food products will be severely limited? A doyen of the industry Sir John Hegarty has come out in favour of a ban on TV ads of unhealthy food before the 9pm watershed. He said there was a growing health crisis. Much of the drinks industry has already accepted the need for calorie labelling. Just as Boris Johnson and other Conservative politicians have moved from a libertarian non-interventionist approach to a call for action on obesity, the business lobby could be shifting as well. This video can not be played The people tackling obesity during lockdown Sue Eustace, director of public affairs at the Advertising Association, said the ""extreme"" and ""unnecessary"" measures would have little effect in reducing obesity, and warned they could have ""wide-ranging ramifications"" for food businesses and online publishers trying to financially recover from the pandemic and the lockdown. ""We have some of the strictest [advertising] rules in the world already and children's exposure to high fat, salt, and sugar adverts on TV has fallen by 70% over the last 15 years or so, but there's been no change to obesity, so we don't think these measures are going to work."" She warned that the measures could affect  a ""whole range"" of household products that people do not necessarily view as junk food, and questioned whether this would restrict businesses like local fish and chip shops from putting their menus online for customers. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calories listed on food products are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories or kcals) - the energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calorie content of a food can be found by burning it and measuring how much heat is released. Foods such as fruits and vegetables have fewer calories than, for instance, cakes or biscuits, which have a high fat or sugar content. Fat contains 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram Alcohol contains 7 kcal (29 kJ) per gram Protein contains 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram Carbohydrate contains 3.75 kcal (16 kJ) per gram (for the purposes of food labelling this is rounded up to 4 kcal per gram) If we consume more calories than we burn up through everyday activity or exercise, we put on weight. Knowing how many calories are in the products we eat can help us keep track. Source:BNF,external But, writing in The Daily Telegraph, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This deadly virus has given us a wake-up call about the need to tackle the stark inequalities in our nation's health, and obesity is an urgent example of this. ""If everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS more than Â£100 million over the next five years. And, more importantly, given the link between obesity and coronavirus, losing weight could be life-saving. ""Obesity is one of the greatest long-term health challenges that we face as a country."" Health experts have welcomed the moves, but some said the government should go even further, while others questioned whether the Treasury's 'Eat Out to Help Out' initiative - granting everyone 50% off meals in restaurants, including fast food outlets, throughout August - would undermine the effort to get people to lose weight. Adam Briggs, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the strategy was ""likely to be a missed opportunity"". He said there were multiple factors that contributed to obesity, adding that it was important to also address the role of economic and social factors, like poverty and unemployment which ""drive poor health and inequalities"". He also pointed out that public health budgets held by councils had been cut over the years. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's mass in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Check your BMI using the BBC calculator Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems. This video can not be played Campaigner Tasha is on a mission to make it easier for young people to have healthier diet choices Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's Board of Science, said: ""The BMA has long been calling for new ways to tackle obesity and we are delighted to see that the government has sat up and listened. ""What we need now is for this strategy to be actioned as quickly as possible, with the promised expansion of NHS services delivered in full, with adequate resources and funding, to ensure that those struggling with their weight can get the support they need and deserve.""

Students back at uni - but with masks and no bars,"The trainee vets say they're relieved to be back with their friends again after the long lockdown The first students are beginning to return for face-to-face teaching on UK university campuses - with a new term of compulsory masks and closed bars. Most students won't begin until the autumn, but veterinary students are now back at the University of Nottingham. They are the pioneers for how campuses across the UK could look as they reopen after the Covid-19 lockdown. ""The social experience will be more limited, but these are unprecedented times,"" says registrar Paul Greatrix. The first cohort going back in Nottingham are 150 trainee vets, some of whom will see a great deal of each other - as the university adopts the ""bubble"" system in which small groups will live as well as study together. The university is calling it ""households"" rather than ""bubbles"", but it is the same principle of restricting the spread of infection by keeping people in small groups which are kept separate from each other. University buildings have highly visible messages reminding students about safety messages Within these households of three to 10 students there will be no need for social distancing or wearing masks, but where different households meet the students will have to stay apart. ""Safety has to be the priority,"" says Dr Greatrix. Students might have to stay in protective bubbles Students face full fees for courses taught online Chinese students want reassurance on Covid safety The buildings are mapped out with one-way systems and hand sanitising stations and masks have to be worn, including in lessons, by staff and students. Lectures will be online and there will be in-person teaching for small groups, which is essential for a practical subject such as veterinary science. Sarah Cripps says it was impossible to teach such a practical subject online The student bars are closed and there are posters up for a pizza night that's going to be an online event. ""We can't emulate an all-night club experience through a Zoom chat,"" says Dr Greatrix. But he says the university is doing everything it can to create a sense of involvement. The students at Nottingham just seem very glad to be back and seeing friends, after months of being cooped up at home and having to study online. Registrar Paul Greatrix says it is a huge logistical operation to get ready for 40,000 students and staff in the autumn They don't seem particularly daunted by the safety restrictions or that much of the socialising will be online. ""We were desperate to come back,"" says Amy Thornton. ""It will be different, but it was time to come back."" She will be living in a bubble with five other trainee vets - and isn't worried about the new arrangements or seeing too much of a small number of people. ""It's just nice to see people again,"" says Emily Howell. ""We're going to have to get on with it."" Tom handles a milk snake as part of the training in looking after reptiles The online lectures are useful, she says, because you can rewind them. ""But I can't wait to do practicals."" Her flatmate, Lewis Ashman, says he has no concerns about any risks from going on to the campus. ""It's safe,"" he says. Tom, getting his first chance to hold a snake and a bearded dragon called Barbie, says it's ""great to be back"". The students don't mind the masks, but they're finding that dogs used in training don't like them - and it can set them off barking. It's also a relief to be back teaching in person rather than online, says clinical assistant professor, Sarah Cripps. Nottingham has a one-way system operating across its buildings Universities didn't close, but went online - and the pandemic has shown the limitations of remote teaching, and how much is missed when students and teachers are not there together in person. And in the case of a practical subject such as learning to be a vet, which is all about handling, it's impossible to switch completely online. Dr Greatrix says reopening for the rest of Nottingham's 40,000 students and staff will be one of the biggest projects the university has ever faced. There will be staggered arrival times in September to reduce contacts between students, in what is like a small town turning up. Emily Howell and Lewis Ashman do not have any worries about the safety of being on campus And there are plans if there are further Covid-19 outbreaks, either in halls of residence or in parts of the city where students are living. There is a strong message of reassurance about safety - not least to overseas students, particularly from China, who have been doubtful of how well the pandemic has been handled in the UK. Dr Greatrix says he will be pleased if more than 50% of overseas students turn up as planned - with many universities fearing a financial hit from cancellations. Universities can introduce safety rules, but students are adults and he recognises there is no way of preventing people in separate bubbles from meeting away from the university - such as going to a local pub. And it's not possible to put the same safety controls on students living in private accommodation. ""We'll try to regularly remind students about a sense of responsibility,"" said Dr Greatrix.

Westminster Abbey 'dealt shattering blow by virus',"The dean of Westminster Abbey, the Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, told the BBC: ""We are vulnerable and we are getting more vulnerable"" Westminster Abbey is down more than Â£12m in revenue this year and is set to make about 20% of its staff redundant as a result of the lockdown. More than 90% of its income comes from visitors paying an entrance fee. It closed its doors on 20 March and only began to reopen for limited tourist visits on 11 July. The dean of Westminster Abbey, the Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, told the BBC the coronavirus had dealt a ""shattering blow"" to the Abbey's finances. Separately, the Church of England's 42 cathedrals are projected to be down more than Â£28.4m on what they thought their budgets would be this year. They are projected to lose another Â£15.5m next year. The Association of English Cathedrals, which represents Westminster Abbey and the Church of England's 42 cathedrals, warned job cuts would hit churches around the country when the government's job retention scheme ended in October. The Abbey's financial reserves would be depleted by a third from September, Dr Hoyle said, and would continue to fall as visitor numbers were not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels for up to five years. ""There is a real need here,"" he said, warning Westminster Abbey expected a similar ""breathtaking"" loss of between Â£9m and Â£12m next year as well. The Abbey is open for services and visits, but numbers are limited as social distancing is enforced. Dr Hoyle said it was ""inconceivable"" that the Abbey would be so quiet, as in a ""normal"" month of July, it would be admitting 1,000 people an hour. ""We are vulnerable and we are getting more vulnerable,"" he said. ""We're negotiating one of the greatest challenges to hit the Abbey in recent times."" Coronavirus saw the Abbey closed for the longest time since the Queen's coronation The Abbey has already announced plans to scrap regular Sunday services at St Margaret's, a medieval church in Parliament Square. The professional choir at St Margaret's will be disbanded and worshippers will be told to merge with the congregation in the Abbey. Due to its status as a Royal Peculiar, Westminster Abbey does not count as one of the Church of England's 42 cathedrals. Instead it is owned directly by the monarch, meaning it is not eligible for funding by the Church Commissioners. While the Abbey makes most of its income from tourism, many places of worship across the UK rely on cash donations from congregations to survive. Having been forced to close their doors due to the lockdown, many are struggling financially. One Sikh temple, Singh Sabha London East, typically received about Â£80,000 a month in donations from attendees. During lockdown, despite losing 90% of its monthly income, the gurdwara provided more than 4,000 meals to NHS staff and other key workers. But Sukhbir Bassi, one of the senior figures at the gurdwara, said that could not continue without government support. ""We are having serious, serious problems,"" he said. Singh Sabha London East received Â£80,000 a month in donations before lockdown The government has pledged Â£750m in support for voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We understand the difficulty lockdown has caused people of faith, which is why we have worked in partnership with faith leaders to enable a phased and safe reopening of places of worship."" It said faith organisations had access to government support including the Coronavirus Community Support Fund. Minster offers telephone services and prayers What are the rules for places of worship?

"Boy, 17, stabbed to death and three others hurt","The 17-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene A 17-year-old has been stabbed to death and four other boys were injured as two groups clashed in Manchester. Police were called to a disturbance in Henbury Street, Moss Side, at about 19:30 BST on Sunday. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. Two 15-year-olds and a 17-year old were also hurt, as well as a 16-year old who is in hospital with ""potentially life-changing injuries."" A 17-year-old boy arrested at the scene remains in custody, police said. The 15-year-olds and the 17-year-old were also arrested on discharge from hospital.

Relive the best clips and analysis as Broad pushes England towards victory,"Broad makes early breakthroughs - now has 499 Test wickets England declare on 226-2 - Burns falls for 90 as England search for quick runs Root hits quickfire 68 and Sibley also passes 50 Heavy rain is forecast on Monday Broad finishes with 6-31 in Windies' 197 Third Test, Emirates Old Trafford, day three, series level at 1-1 Watch Today at the Test at 19:00 BST Callum Matthews That is it from us on day three of the third Test. It might not be tomorrow, because of the horrendous weather forecast for Manchester, but it feels a matter of time before England wrap up this Test and the series. You can read Stephan Shemilt's reporthere. The scorecard ishere. You can download the Test Match Special podcast fromherelater on. And don't forget Today at the Test is live on BBC Two NOW! You can also watch it at the top of this page on iPlayerhere. See you tomorrow! Carlos BrathwaiteWest Indies all-rounder on BBC Test Match Special West Indies could be all gloom and doom but someone in that dressing room should think that they can play a brilliant innings to save this match, especially if the rain interrupts a lot of play tomorrow. Someone needs to put their hand up and bat through a session at a time. As you go down the line-up you get more expressive strokeplayers and if they start worrying about just staying in then they'll get a ball with their name on it. You need to stand up to the bowlers and regain a bit of impetus as well. BBC Two Don't forget if you've missed any of the action or been following the final day of the Premier League season instead that Today at the Test will be live on BBC Two and iPlayer at 19:00 BST. Sky's coverage has just shown that more than Â£600,000 has been raised for the Ruth Strauss Foundation too. A magnificent effort in what is testing, difficult times. And that dart at West Indies proved profitable as Stuart Broad moved from 497 Test wickets to 499 with the wickets of John Campbell and Kemar Roach. As soon as we next get back on the field you wouldn't back against Broad bringing up 500 pretty quickly. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special Because Stuart Broad has had to always be around James Anderson it's been Anderson then Broad. But what Stuart has achieved is remarkable. He's had some low moments in the last few years, where his rhythm and pace have been done. Maybe lockdown has done the trick for him - a time to just think about things, where he's at and what he wants to achieve in his career. The way he's been bowling, he's guaranteed to reach 500 Test wickets in this match. Joe Root played absolutely superbly too for his 56-ball 68. He gave the England innings much needed impetus and put them in a position to declare and have a dart at West Indies tonight. Carlos BrathwaiteWest Indies all-rounder on BBC Test Match Special West Indies have been found wanting in the batting department especially. That 300 target is so mentally shattering for the West Indies. England now they just need to get above that to put real pressure on them. You want to see one or two more batsmen more capable of regularly reaching 50 and the team coming together to make 300-350 more often. The batting unit is therefore putting a lot of pressure on the captain Jason Holder and the bowlers. Dom Sibley and Rory Burns were patient in their innings but both played nicely for 56 and 90 respectively. They shared 114 for the first wicket which was the first time that England have had a century opening stand since 2016. England were ragged this morning but up stepped the man of the moment Stuart Broad to clear up the West Indies tail. Rory Burns talking to Sky Sports:""We're in a good position, those two wickets were a nice bonus. ""We didn't quite hit our straps this morning, that was slightly disappointing but the way we came back and gave ourselves the opportunity to bat as we did put ourselves in a good position."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special The two late wickets justified everything England did today. Stuart Broad now has 14 wickets for 83 runs in this series. It's almost impossible to face a bowler in the form he had today. If we get even half a day tomorrow, I think this match and series is all over on Monday. England opener Rory Burns on Test Match Special:""Sibs noticed in the slip that Broady was on 499 so we were aware he could've done it. ""I don't think there was much thought about the follow-on this morning. We didn't quite hit our straps in the first hour but came back really well. ""Our plan after lunch was just to bat normally, set a good foundation and see where we got to. ""Joe Root spoke to me at tea about possibly declaring tonight so after that we tried to nudge it on. The weather is definitely the big factor behind the declaration. ""I think I might have got another over to try and reach 100 if I'd not got out but the most important thing is the victory. ""It's always nice to get a hundred but it's always nice to get a Test win. I thought Joe played really nicely, especially being able to come in and score more than a run a ball."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special It was a bit odd that neither James Anderson nor Stuart Broad bowled this morning until after West Indies avoided the follow-on. Here is Monday's weather forecast. It's not improving but those two late wickets gives England a superb chance of winning this Test and the series whenever they next get back on the field. It's been a strange day. England were unthreatening in the first hour, they were accused of batting too slow in the afternoon session, but if you offered them this situation at the start of the day, would they have taken it? Of course they would. It's been the perfect day for England. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special There was that frustrating period where you did wonder if England would get a wriggle on and get bowling tonight but here we are. Here are those two wickets that Stuart Broad took tonight. Superb. Fantastic. Brilliant. There are no words. Having somehow been left out of the first Test, Stuart Broad has taken 14 wickets in the series at a ridiculous average of 10.5. If our live text let me use emojis, the fire emoji would be coming out right now. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on Test Match Special Stuart Broad really almost ended the day with his 500th wicket there. That just beat the outside edge. Â© 2025 BBC.

Man Utd beat Leicester to reach Champions LeagueManchester United's 2-0 win secures a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League.,"Anthony Martial was brought down for the penalty from which Bruno Fernandes gave Manchester United the lead Manchester United secured a place in the Champions League at the expense of Leicester City with victory at King Power Stadium. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side needed a point from this decisive final-day meeting to confirm a place in the top four - and break the hearts of the Foxes, who were in a Champions League spot for so much of the season. Leicester needed victory once Chelsea took command at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers but their dreams were dashed as Bruno Fernandes scored a 71st-minute penalty after Anthony Martial tumbled under challenge from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans. Both sides had their chances, with Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel saving well from Marcus Rashford in the first half and Jamie Vardy seeing a header glance off the frame of the goal after the break. Leicester pressed but could not break Manchester United down and their misery was compounded when Evans was sent off against his former club for a wild, late lunge on Scott McTominay. Manchester United confirmed the formalities seconds from time when substitute Jesse Lingard robbed Schmeichel and rolled the ball into an empty net. It is a result that fulfils the usual minimum requirement of Champions League qualification for Manchester United. But while Leicester City's fifth-placed finish is highly creditable and earns a place in the Europa League, this will undoubtedly be a huge disappointment and anti-climax after being in a position to reach the Champions League for so long. It will be scant consolation for them that striker Vardy will claim the Golden Boot, as the Premier League's top scorer with 23 goals. Reaction to the Premier League final day Jamie Vardy wins Premier League Golden Boot This video can not be played Leicester 0-2 Man Utd: Solskjaer 'delighted' after Man Utd qualify for Champions League After Fernandes had made an impressive debut in a goalless draw at home to Wolves on 1 February, Manchester United stood 14 points adrift of Leicester City, who were third. Fast forward to his decisive role in this victory that sees United qualify for next season's Champions League by taking that third place, and you can see the extent of his impact. The Portuguese attacker - a mid-season signing from Sporting Lisbon in a deal that could eventually be worth around Â£68m - has provided the missing link for this Manchester United side. He has built a bridge between midfield and a talented attacking array of strikers with his talent and his positive style, looking forward every time he receives possession. Fernandes was not at his best here but he was the man who unlocked Leicester's defence as Martial won the crucial penalty, then performed his usual hop, skip and jump to send Schmeichel the wrong way and ease any lingering United nerves. It capped a remarkable recovery for Manchester United - with credit also due to manager Solskjaer for guiding his side into the top four. This video can not be played Leicester 2-0 Man Utd: We wouldnât be challenging without Vardyâs goals - Brendan Rodgers The scenes at the final whistle here showed the extent of Leicester City's bitter disappointment at being denied the footballing and financial prize that seemed theirs for the taking for so long. Brendan Rodgers' side had started to lose their early-season sparkle even before the campaign was halted in March by the coronavirus pandemic - yet they were still in a powerful position as the finish line approached. They have still had a fine season but there is no point glossing over this huge missed opportunity. Rodgers is left to rue moments such as the inexplicable meltdown at Bournemouth, where they led at half-time only to lose 4-1. The manager faces a big job to pick his players up and remind them of what they have achieved in returning to European football. When they go into next season's Europa League, will they be without players such as Ben Chilwell, a target for Chelsea and reduced here to exhorting his team-mates from the directors' box as he was absent through injury? January signing Bruno Fernandes has transformed Manchester United this season and held his nerve when it mattered against Leicester Leicester finished fifth despite ending 325 days inside the top four places during the season. Manchester United recorded a top-four finish in the Premier League for just the second time in five seasons - and the third time in seven seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has lost 10 of his 12 meetings with Manchester United across all competitions, suffering defeats in each of the past five. Manchester United extended their unbeaten run to 14 games in the Premier League, their longest run without defeat in the competition since April 2017. Bruno Fernandes' penalty was the 14th Manchester United have been awarded in the Premier League this season, which is the most for a team in a single campaign in the competition's history. Since making his debut in the competition in February, Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player (15). Jesse Lingard scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United since December 2018, when he hit two in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game in charge against Cardiff. Harry Maguire became the first outfield player since Gary Pallister in 1994-95 to start every game in a Premier League campaign for Manchester United.

Crash fears amid rising biker numbers in lockdown,"Police have clocked motorcyclists speeding on roads in the Brecon Beacons during lockdown More motorcyclists could be seriously injured on Welsh roads as people avoid public transport, experts have warned. Last year 247 bikers were seriously injured or killed in Wales. Police said nearly 50,000 motorbikes had been counted on roads in one weekend in lockdown. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) said greater awareness was needed from all road users in order to cut deaths. RoSPA safety officer Michelle Harrington said Wales' ""spectacular"" scenery meant people in England were increasingly coming across the border to ride. ""Given the reluctance to use public transport we could see even more motorcyclists on our roads,"" she said. ""Motorcyclists tend to come off the worst, what would normally be a small bump for someone in a car would cause serious injury. ""It is a tragedy for everyone affected, but often people do not think about it until they are involved in a crash or someone they love has been hurt."" Police are now using technology to track hot spots to send officers and help prevent crashes During the first few months of lockdown, police accused some motorists of using quieter roads as""racing tracks"", with data revealing more accidents happened in fine weather. Trauma consultant sees rise in biker injuries in lockdown Driven to his death: Mystery of motorcyclist body on M4 Motorbike rider in shorts and flip flops badly injured Police figures, from road safety campaign Operation Darwen, show a ""significant increase"" in bikers using Welsh roads after travel restrictions were eased. Ch Insp Tom Sharville, from Dyfed-Powys Police, said on Saturday 11 June, 22,000 bikers were counted on roads, rising to nearly 27,000 on the Sunday. This is compared to about 4,500 bikes on an average weekday, he said. ""The number of collisions involving bikes during the first weekend saw a demand on resources that had not been there in previous weekends during lockdown,"" he said. Police across Wales are now using technology to try and stop crashes, using live sensors under trunk roads to record hot spots to get officers on the scene quickly. Ch Ins Sharville said: ""It's not about targeting bikers, or trying to catch them out - rather it focuses on ensuring the safety of riders in Wales."" Statistics for 2019 595accidents 22bikers killed 84%of accidents happened in fine weather 25%happened at a junction Latest statistics show,externalthat of the 5,789 people hurt in accidents on Welsh roads in 2019, 595 (10.27%) were motorcyclists. Of these, 22 bikers were killed. Half of these fatal accidents happened in the Dyfed-Powys Police area. In 2013, the Welsh Government set a target to reduce the number of bikers killed or seriously hurt in accidents by 25% by 2020. But numbers, when compared with data from 2004-08, have only fallen by 3.9%. Ms Harrington said biker numbers had increased in recent years, making the target harder to reach, and numbers were expected to be higher as people avoided public transport due to coronavirus. Wales' scenery and twisting roads are popular with bikers from across the UK South Wales Advanced Motorcycle Group said its members had been ""appalled"" by the reckless behaviour during lockdown of a small number of bikers who were giving responsible riders a ""bad name"". ""There are a lot of really well behaved motorcyclists, but they are almost invisible to the general public,"" said chairman Dave Hutton. ""A lot of members of our group have volunteered as blood bike riders during lockdown, helping to save lives across the UK, and many have been acting as local community champions, helping deliver shopping and prescriptions to people who are isolating."" Mr Hutton said motorcyclists were very difficult to spot and very easy for drivers to miss when turning or pulling out at a junction, making them very vulnerable. ""There was a time when you would expect to see several police vehicles on a stretch of road, but now you can go on a long journey and not see any at all,"" he said. ""Welsh roads are some of the best in the UK. There's a very large shared border, the roads here are very bendy and very fast, which some motorcyclists like."" Mr Hutton said motorbike companies were using fears over public transport to boost sales during lockdown, though bikes were a great alternative for easing congestion in cities. However, he added, issues tended to be with younger riders and ""born again bikers"", who go back on the roads without new training. ""You can enjoy the thrills and still stay perfectly within the law, and if you do anything that is not within the law you will not pass,"" he said. Residents living near the rural A4215 between Libanus and Defynnog met two years ago following a fatal crash For years, residents living near the 60mph A4215 between Libanus and Defynnog, in Powys, have been campaigning for safety measures on the road after a number of fatalities. ""When someone pulls out, no-one can see properly and it can mean game over,"" said resident Anita Denny. She said people were now scared to leave their homes as more people travelled to the area in the summer and during lockdown, with near misses and crashes. Ms Denny said that while the majority of road users were well behaved, going to the shops could mean driving head on into lorries, motorbikes and cars. In recent weeks, Dyfed-Powys Police said they had caughtmotorcyclists going 127 mph on the Brecon bypass near Pen y Fan, while all forcescaptured motorists speeding across Wales during lockdown. Residents have taken it upon themselves to put up signs Fay Jones, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, visited the road on 19 July. ""I am well aware that many bikers use the road responsibly, and I am very keen to ensure they keep enjoying the Brecon Beacons and all that we have to offer, but any vehicle speeding is unsafe, inconsiderate and needs to stop,"" she said. Ms Jones said the Army had agreed to stop sending lorries down the road and Powys council had been supportive of improving safety measures, and was discussing measures with Dyfed-Powys Police. She said she was arranging a meeting with Google Maps to discuss how to stop people being sent down the road by sat-navs. Police said they clocked many people breaking speed limits during lockdown While the number of fatal accidents has fallen steadily over recent years, last year there was a slight increase in the number of accidents on Welsh roads, with 2.5% more compared with 2018. And while Gwent Police recorded the smallest number of accidents, it saw the biggest increase in collisions, from 632 to 715 - 32%. The force said the rise could be down to a change in more accurate reporting systems, and an increase in traffic on roads following the removal of the tolls on the Prince of Wales bridge and the M48 Severn Bridge. Ms Harrington said many dangerous roads in Wales had been ""designed out"" and most accidents were down to human error, such as drivers not seeing bikers. She said that, as biker numbers increased, greater awareness was needed by all road users, but that it was proving hard to get motorcyclists to attend road safety courses put on to reduce accidents. ""We find there is a reluctance, sometimes local authorities do not fill the spaces, possibly because motorcyclists think 'I've been driving for 20 years, what can they teach me?',"" she said. Road safety partnership, Go Safe, said motorcyclists were ""specifically vulnerable"" and the police had engaged with bikers to increase safety through Operation Darwen. The Welsh Government said it took road safety ""extremely seriously"" and every death was ""one too many"". ""We continue to work with our partners to achieve the targets set out in the Road Safety Framework for Wales and ensure roads are safe for all users,"" a spokesman said.

False claims about vaccine hunt,"In the week that Oxford University announced promising results from its coronavirus vaccine trial, we're looking at claims on social media about vaccines and misleading statements about their safety. The anti-vaccination movement has gained traction online in recent years, and campaigners opposed to vaccination have moved their focus to making claims relating to the coronavirus. First, a video containing inaccurate claims about coronavirus vaccine trials, made by osteopath Carrie Madej, that has proved popular on social media. Carrie Madej's video makes a false claim that the vaccines will change recipients' DNA (which carries genetic information). ""The Covid-19 vaccines are designed to make us into genetically modified organisms."" She also claims - without any evidence - that vaccines will ""hook us all up to an artificial intelligence interface"". Coronavirus vaccine: Might it have side-effects? There are25 different candidate vaccines,externalin clinical trials around the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but none of them will alter human DNA and they do not contain technology to link people up to an artificial intelligence interface. The vaccines are all designed to provoke an immune response by training our bodies to recognise and fight the virus. Carrie Madej makes a number of other false claims, including that vaccine trials are ""not following any sound scientific protocol to make sure this is safe"". ""New vaccines undergo rigorous safety checks before they can be recommended for widespread use,"" says Michelle Roberts, BBC online health editor. We have asked Carrie Madej for comment about these claims, but have received no response at the time of publication. It was first uploaded to YouTube in June, where it clocked more than 300,000 views, but it has also been popular on Facebook and Instagram. It's still circulating in the United States, the UK and elsewhere. There was a small protest in South Africa a week after a Covid-19 vaccine trial started in Johannesburg A scientist in South Africa, Sarah Downs, who writes under the alias Mistress of Science, said she was alerted to the video by her mother whose prayer group had shared it. The scientist sent her own debunking information to this group and says: ""They are now much better informed, which I'm so glad about, because they were all taken in by that video."" Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know When the preliminary results of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine study were publishedon Monday, the topic provoked much debate in coronavirus-focused Facebook groups. Some Facebook users posted comments saying they didn't want the vaccine as they felt they would be used as ""guinea pigs"" and that it had been ""rushed into production at warp speed"". While there might be concerns about safety given the accelerated pace of development, Prof Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told the BBC the rigorous safety processes included in all clinical trials were in place. This includes safety reports to regulators in the countries taking part. The trial has been so fast in concluding the first two phases because of the head start provided by previous work on coronavirus vaccines in Oxford, the acceleration of administrative and funding processes, and the huge interest in the trial which meant no time was spent searching for volunteers. What is it like to be a vaccine volunteer? As the trial moves to its third phase, with thousands more volunteers taking part, all the participants will be monitored for side-effects. There were no dangerous side-effects from taking the vaccine in the first two phases, though 16-18% of trial participants given the vaccine reported a fever. Researchers said side-effects could be managed with paracetamol. When the Oxford vaccine trial first started, there was a claim that the first volunteer had died. The story was quickly debunked by fact-checkers and the BBC's medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, conducted an interview with the volunteer. A meme circulating on social media claims vaccines were responsible for 50 million deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. But this is completely wrong. Firstly, as the US Centers for Disease Control states,there was no vaccine at the time,external. Scientists in Britain and the US did experiment with basic bacterial vaccines, but these were not vaccines as we would recognise them today, says historian and author Mark Honingsbaum. This was ""for the good reason that no-one knew that the influenza was a virus"". How they tried to curb Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 There were two main causes of death - the initial flu infection or from the strong enormous immune response the virus triggered leading to lungs being filled with fluids.

Watford Watford captain Troy Deeney speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live:""Itâs not about todayâs game, itâs a year of not being good
enough. We can be frustrated with today but if we canât defend as a team youâre
going to lose more games than you win. But itâs worse for the fans and those who work at the club theyâre the ones
that might lose their jobs and it isnât fair on them. ""The club from top to bottom
will need to do an audit. Because sacking three managers in one season means we
havenât got it right. Something went wrong, is that managers, is that players
is it ownership? We need to audit that and go through it all to see what went
wrong. ""One thing Iâm certainly not going to do is come out here and
make excuses, we just havenât been good enough basically. ""Iâm 32 years old, Iâve a knee operation next week because Iâve
been playing injured for the last month. I honestly donât know if this is going
to be my last game at Watford or in the Premier League. I donât know, itâs too
early to talk about that and itâs not about me itâs about the people at the
club who work at the club and will be affected. Iâll take a few days away,
assess and take some grief online no doubt. ""But you know if I do ultimately stop playing for Watford as
of now Iâve had a great run, next week or the week after is going to be 10 years at this club. That donât happen often, I think the whole country has had
enough of Covid and Iâm right in that. Basicallly Iâm going to go and get
my knee sorted and go and spend some time with my family and at the end of the
day theyâre the only people whose opinions I care about. If someone wants to
give me grief online then please do it. Iâm a big boy with big shoulders and Iâve
had some real world issues so getting some stick online doesnât bother me. ""I have had my say in the dressing room trying to be as
positive and as real as I can be, players come and go fans and clubs and
legacies will be there a lot longer than us. The bigger picture is the club,
the people whose jobs are here and how we can safeguard those. Iâm sorry if I
didnât answer your question but I donât want to make it about me or the other
players, we know we havenât been good enough the table reflects that. But itâs
all about re-building and if this is my last game for the club Iâve had a good
run. Highest of highs and lowest of the lows, this will be the lowest one yet."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
The dying teenager who wanted world peace (and love),"When Californian teenager Jeff Henigson was diagnosed with brain cancer and given two years to live, a children's charity granted him the wish of a lifetime. But Jeff didn't choose to go to Disneyland or meet his favourite footballer - Jeff just wanted world peace. In the summer of 1986, 15-year-old Jeff Henigson was riding his bike to the local electronics shop to buy the last part for a ""super laser"" he'd been building, when he was hit by a van. ""It's coming in the opposite direction and she doesn't see me and just smashes right into me,"" Jeff says. ""And I'm launched, like a rocket, 10 feet backwards. I land on the back of my head."" Jeff wasn't wearing a helmet, and was knocked unconscious. A few hours later, he woke up in hospital. He seemed to be OK, though, so he was discharged the same day. But within a few weeks Jeff began having seizures and he returned to the hospital, this time to have a CT scan of his brain. If it had shown injuries from the cycling accident, Jeff would not have been surprised. But the news was worse than that - the scan revealed a tumour. ""Two things went through my mind,"" Jeff says. ""One was a plan to lose my virginity that summer. And let's just say that did not work out. The second was to complete my laser project."" Jeff was an ambitious teenager, whose dream was to work for Nasa. He believed that the best way to impress them was to build ""the most amazing laser"" which could bounce a beam off of a reflector that had been left on the moon by Apollo 11. But the laser was also a way for him to bond with his father, a distant figure, who had served with the US Navy in World War Two. ""I didn't know at the time if that was because of the war or something else. But my father was separate, emotionally, from the rest of us. And I thought, 'Here's this thing we have in common. This fascination with science. This fascination with space.' And that's why I pursued it."" Though Jeff's father never mentioned his experiences in the Pacific when the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he would talk, at length, about nuclear weapons, the nuclear threat and the US's relationship with the USSR. And this seems to have had an impact on Jeff. Jeff's father, Bob Henigson ""There was a fictional film in the early 1980s called The Day After. It was about the Soviet Union dropping nuclear bombs on the US. I was probably 11 years old, and I was scared out of my mind. I would often fall asleep at night and go straight into a nightmare about nuclear war,"" Jeff remembers. Jeff hoped not only that he would get that dream job with Nasa, but that the organisation would start to work with the USSR rather than competing with it. ""Even when I was fairly young, I could see the potential for collaboration between the US and Soviet Union,"" he says. ""It just never made sense to me that we were pointing nuclear weapons at each other, when we could be collaborating to do extraordinary things in space."" As it happened, Jeff didn't only fail to lose his virginity, he didn't have time to finish his laser either. He needed surgery - quickly. After spending almost six hours on the table, doctors were able to remove the tumour in its entirety. He then faced a seven-day wait to find out whether it was cancerous. ""The doctor walks in, and I could just tell from the look on her face she was not going to deliver good news. She told me, 'I'm very sorry to say you have brain cancer and it's a very aggressive, fast-growing type of cancer,'"" Jeff says. He asked how long he had to live. ""Maybe two years,"" was the doctor's reply. Jeff began radiation and chemotherapy treatments and tried his best to keep up with his school work. He also got involved with a support group for teenagers with cancer. Listen to Jeff talking on Outlook, on the BBC World Service (producer Thomas Harding Assinder) Download the Outlook podcast ""They'd tell me all about the things they'd done - going to Disneyland or meeting a famous athlete. And I'd say, 'Oh, I thought that wish thing was for little kids,' and they said, 'We're kids.' I just didn't see myself that way."" Helping the teenagers to do these things was an organisation called the Starlight Children's Foundation. Jeff's mum made contact with them on his behalf, and a couple of volunteers, Matt and Teri, came over to his house in South Pasadena to talk about his wishes. ""I said, 'I just have to ask, can you guys possibly get me on the next space shuttle mission?' They just looked at me like 'Oh, you're so ridiculous,' and said, 'Absolutely not.'"" Matt and Teri asked Jeff if he had a second wish, and yes, he did. He'd recently re-watched The Day After - the film that had given him terrible nightmares about nuclear war a few years earlier - and had visited the library to do more research. ""I was really feeling angry that we were investing so much in nuclear weapons. I thought maybe it would be a good idea to invest in cancer research instead,"" he says. So he told Matt and Teri: ""I would like to travel to the Soviet Union and meet with Mikhail Gorbachev, so we can discuss a plan to bring an end to nuclear weapons and the Cold War."" There was a pause. Matt and Teri then asked Jeff if he had a third wish, probably hoping it would be something easier to satisfy. But he didn't want anything else. ""I said, 'I totally understand if you can't make this happen, but it's my only wish.'"" Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR in 1985 Amazingly, the Starlight Foundation started trying to make it a reality. They arranged for Jeff to join a trip to the Soviet Union with an organisation called Youth Ambassadors of America. Then they started contacting people they thought might have connections to Gorbachev. They told him that they'd try their best, but couldn't promise that it would happen. Jeff had an image in his head of what the Soviet Union would be like - thanks in part to films like Red Dawn, released in 1984, in which the US is invaded by the Soviet Union and her allies. ""These films portrayed the Soviets as hardcore militants who were determined to destroy the United States. I must say, I went to see a militant country with a militant people,"" Jeff admits. ""And I was quite surprised by the people I actually met."" Jeff in Moscow with Youth Ambassadors of America, in April 1988 The Youth Ambassadors were determined to see if they could spot any spies - keeping an eye out for furtive glances and trench coats as they toured the country. They were disappointed to not find any in Leningrad, but when they were walking through Moscow, a member of the group noticed that they were being followed. ""We were like, 'No way! Are you serious?' And he was like, 'I'm totally sure! Every time I turn around, he turns and looks at whatever's next to him.' It was right out of a movie. And he was wearing a trenchcoat. It was great."" One of the teenagers came up with the idea of counting down from three and spinning around at the same time to say hello in Russian to the man they believed was following them. Jeff was hesitant, he didn't want to risk losing his meeting with Gorbachev. ""But finally I give in. So we do the countdown, and all spin around and yellprivyet, and the guy turns around and looks at a wall - there was nothing to look at. It was classic."" In their hotel rooms, they noticed that there were sections of each wall where the wallpaper didn't quite match. One of the Youth Ambassadors decided to poke a hole and found a microphone inside. They were being listened to. ""I guess the only thing that freaked me out was when one of the girls went back to her room and found two guys going through all of her stuff,"" Jeff says. ""That was a little disturbing. I was wondering if they would go through my things. I had a present for Mr Gorbachev and I didn't want them to steal that. It was my high school yearbook, which everyone in my school had signed. It was a silly little gift, but I liked it and I hoped he would too."" Jeff kept being told that people were working on getting him a meeting with Gorbachev. Then one day he was told to put on the suit that he'd brought for the occasion, and be in the lobby at 8am the next day. ""I wanted to know what his hopes were for bringing an end to nuclear weapons,"" Jeff says. ""But I also wanted to tell him about American kids, what we wanted in this world, and how it wasn't that different from what Soviet kids wanted. We wanted to learn things, travel the world, visit each other's countries. None of these things were facilitated through this militant stance that our countries took towards one another, so I wanted to talk to him about that and see what he had to say."" Soviet participants in the Moscow youth conference However at the very moment his hopes seemed about to be realised, they were suddenly dashed. As he waited anxiously in the lobby, a man from Gorbachev's office came to deliver the news that he was unavailable to meet Jeff. When Jeff responded that he'd be free the next day, he was told that Gorbachev would never be available to meet him. ""Who knows what brought an end to that meeting with Gorbachev,"" Jeff says. ""Maybe it was never planned in the first place. I was pretty devastated."" But the man went on to say that they'd arranged an introduction for him to another important figure. Jeff was told to pack an overnight bag, and was driven by limousine to the countryside. He wasn't told anything about the man he was going to meet. ""There was this lovely couple there, and they welcomed me to their home. We ended up having a really lovely experience, and incredible conversations over a fine dinner. They were talking about all sorts of philosophical notions for a better Earth, for how our countries could co-exist,"" Jeff fondly recalls. I wasn't until he returned to Moscow and told one of his co-ordinators the name of the family he had had such a wonderful time with that he realised who he'd had dinner with. ""She said, 'You met with Evgeny Velikhov? Do you realise who he is?'"" Mikhail Gorbachev's nuclear adviser and Jeff's host, Evgeny Velikhov Velikhov was one of the country's top nuclear physicists, she explained, and Gorbachev's right hand man when it came to nuclear weapons. He hadn't met Gorbachev, but he had spent the evening talking to a man who played a key role in arms negotiations. With the Youth Ambassadors conference over, and his signed yearbook safely delivered to Gorbachev's assistant, Jeff flew back home to California. His parents met him at the airport, but it wasn't really the welcome reception he'd been expecting. Much to his dismay, neither his mother nor his father asked a single question about his trip. When he raised the subject, it was his father who spoke. ""My dad said, 'I have a question - did you meet with Mikhail Gorbachev?' I said, 'No.' And that was the end of the dialogue. It made me feel like a failure."" Jeff had finished his treatment before the trip, so he now went back to normal life and school. Then one day, a month and a half later, he received a phone call from Moscow. ""I ran to pick it up and it's Jack Matlock Jr, the US ambassador to the Soviet Union. And he says, 'Son, we have thousands and thousands of letters here that are all addressed to you.'"" Jeff had spoken to a well-known journalist in Leningrad, who had published a story about Jeff's last wish to visit the Soviet Union. At the end of the piece, he had invited people to write letters to Jeff. And thousands of people from across the Soviet Union had done so. Jeff being interviewed by journalist Nikolai Sivach ""Mr Matlock said to me, 'Listen, we're not the US Postal Service, we can't send you all of these, but we'll send you a sampling. And son, good luck.'"" Jeff only received a couple of letters in English, but the school's Russian teacher translated the headline of the news story for him - ""In leaving, I will stay"". A reference to his cancer. ""It made me feel like death was close again and I no longer wanted to be the kid with cancer. So I ended up taking those letters, putting them in a box, and writing 'nostalgia' in block letters on the top."" But despite the grim warning given by the hospital doctor, Jeff's death was not in fact close. He hid the box away, and kept living his life. Time ticked by, and his tumour didn't return. He moved to London to study at the London School of Economics and then back to the US to attend Columbia University. He started working for the United Nations. Still no tumour. Then one day in the summer of 2008, when he was 37, Jeff returned to his childhood bedroom with his then-wife. He was throwing away what he no longer needed or wanted, organising the things he did, and boxing up the laser project that had been interrupted all those years ago. And as he went through everything, he found the box with 'nostalgia' written on the top. He was at a low point in his life, Jeff says. He had been forced to leave his job at the UN because of seizures caused by scar tissue in his brain. His marriage also was coming to an end. This time, the box held a fascination for him. ""The letters, somewhat overwhelming 20 years before as I wanted to disassociate myself from cancer, were welcome the second time around,"" he says. He found a letter in the stack that was written in good English - and there was a phone number. He checked what time it was in St Petersburg and decided to call. The phone rang three times, and a woman answered in Russian. Jeff asked if, by any chance, her name was Svetlana. And it was. Twenty-three years earlier she had written him a letter in response to the article. She was shocked that he was still alive, and offered to help him translate the remaining letters, and track down others who had taken the time to write too. Envelope of letter to Jeff from reader of the article in Smena, June 1988 ""A number of volunteers translated the letters for me - one in particular, Eugenia Zhurbinskaya. I knew early on that I wanted to connect with these people. I was interested in documentary film-making, and a couple of film-makers I discussed my story with encouraged me to assemble a film crew, return to Russia, and interview the people who had written to me."" In the Summer of 2011, Jeff got on a plane with a film crew and flew to St Petersburg for 10 days to meet several of the original letter-writers that his contacts had located. He later returned twice more, but no film was ever made. ""Some of the stories were absolutely stunning,"" Jeff recalls. ""There was this woman, Nina Ivanovna Dmitrieva, she was in her 80s then, who had been walking down the street in Leningrad as a child in the 1940s when she hears this rumbling in the sky and a bomb detonates over the building next to her, which collapsed on top of her and crushed her skull. They took her to the hospital, and she goes through three brain surgeries during the siege of Leningrad, and still managed to survive. The area she had the surgery was exactly the same area where I had my tumour. That was mind-blowing. She felt like I was her child."" Nina Ivanovna Dmitrieva, who survived the siege of Leningrad Jeff fondly recalls a woman called Nelly Slepkova, then in her 80s, who had been a geologist. ""She told me that they looked for uranium. When I asked what for, she looked at me like, 'You idiot!' And she said, 'To build nuclear weapons, of course.'"" Nelly Slepkova, geologist Jeff also had the opportunity to meet the journalist who had written the story about him all those years ago. Journalist Nikolai Sivach in 2011 ""We had a pretty intense interaction. He kept wanting to communicate his success, but unlike every other Russian I'd met on that trip, all the letter writers, he did not talk about his family. I finally asked him about it and he slows down and looks at me and says, 'I had a very difficult relationship with my father.' And there was something I understood there because I hadn't resolved my relationship with my father."" This took a long time. In the Christmas holidays of 2013 Jeff went to visit his parents, and confronted his dad about how emotionally distant he had been. He told him how difficult he had found it being his son. ""When I finished, he thought for a moment and said, 'It is difficult to have lain against me, accusations...' And I just felt this anger building up in me, but he continued, 'identical to those I laid against my own father.'"" For the first time, Jeff's father opened up to his son about his childhood. His father had been a Hollywood producer, he said, and a gambling addict. ""He'd bring a small fortune home from a well-performing film to his ever-neurotic wife, and then he'd lose it in a late-night card game."" He rarely had anything to say to his children, though they were witnesses to his anger, and he showed little interest in their lives. ""My father repeated the distance, but not the lack of care. He provided for us. He took us on vacation. He came home each night for dinner, even if it was an hour or three later than my friends' suppers with their families. He just couldn't make the emotional connection. He couldn't express feelings,"" Jeff says. Jeff with his parents, Robert and Phyllis Henigson ""Not long after that, he gathered the family for the first and only time, and told us all that he loved us. He died a month later. So I am absolutely grateful that we found our peace."" Jeff is now 49 and working as a writer. His first book, Warhead, is about his own experiences, and he is following it up with a young adult novel. A recent MRI scan of his brain has given him a clean bill of health, though he expects to live with epilepsy for the rest of his life. He's still occasionally in touch with some of the Russian letter-writers, or their English-speaking grandchildren. Nelly, the geologist, is well. Sadly, he hasn't heard for a while from Nina, the survivor of the siege of Leningrad. Jeff regrets that a trusting relationship between the US and Russia seems very far away, and remains anxious about their vast nuclear stockpiles, and the danger of further nuclear proliferation which he believes ""presents a very real and ever-growing threat to human existence"". ""Iran seems determined to obtain nukes, and Turkey and Saudi Arabia will not sit idly by if Iran succeeds. The US has withdrawn from one key nuclear disarmament treaty, the INF treaty, and has signalled that another, New START, will not be extended,"" he says. ""Russia is investing in new nuclear weapons systems and China is on pace to double its nuclear stockpile in the next decade. While I no longer wake up in a cold sweat, I think nuclear war is becoming increasingly likely. There is much to worry about.""

Watford Watford captain Troy Deeney speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live:""Itâs not about todayâs game, itâs a year of not being good
enough. We can be frustrated with today but if we canât defend as a team youâre
going to lose more games than you win. But itâs worse for the fans and those who work at the club theyâre the ones
that might lose their jobs and it isnât fair on them. ""The club from top to bottom
will need to do an audit. Because sacking three managers in one season means we
havenât got it right. Something went wrong, is that managers, is that players
is it ownership? We need to audit that and go through it all to see what went
wrong. ""One thing Iâm certainly not going to do is come out here and
make excuses, we just havenât been good enough basically. ""Iâm 32 years old, Iâve a knee operation next week because Iâve
been playing injured for the last month. I honestly donât know if this is going
to be my last game at Watford or in the Premier League. I donât know, itâs too
early to talk about that and itâs not about me itâs about the people at the
club who work at the club and will be affected. Iâll take a few days away,
assess and take some grief online no doubt. ""But you know if I do ultimately stop playing for Watford as
of now Iâve had a great run, next week or the week after is going to be 10 years at this club. That donât happen often, I think the whole country has had
enough of Covid and Iâm right in that. Basicallly Iâm going to go and get
my knee sorted and go and spend some time with my family and at the end of the
day theyâre the only people whose opinions I care about. If someone wants to
give me grief online then please do it. Iâm a big boy with big shoulders and Iâve
had some real world issues so getting some stick online doesnât bother me. ""I have had my say in the dressing room trying to be as
positive and as real as I can be, players come and go fans and clubs and
legacies will be there a lot longer than us. The bigger picture is the club,
the people whose jobs are here and how we can safeguard those. Iâm sorry if I
didnât answer your question but I donât want to make it about me or the other
players, we know we havenât been good enough the table reflects that. But itâs
all about re-building and if this is my last game for the club Iâve had a good
run. Highest of highs and lowest of the lows, this will be the lowest one yet."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Harry Dunn family drop legal action against policeMr Dunn's family believe a suspect in the case was allowed to leave the UK unlawfully.Northampton,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The parents of a young man whose death in a crash sparked an international diplomatic row have dropped their legal action against Northamptonshire Police. Harry Dunn, 19, was fatally injured outside RAF Croughton in August. His family began legal action against the force and the Foreign Office after US suspect Anne Sacoolas left the UK, citing diplomatic immunity. After seeing documents disclosed in the case the family said the ""police are absolved of any blame"". The information provided for the court proceedings showed the force ""could have done no more last August and September to ensure that Mrs Sacoolas was brought to justice"", said family spokesman Radd Seiger. Police had been ""kept in the dark"" by the FCO (Foreign & Commonwealth Office) about uncertainty relating to Mrs Sacoolas' immunity status, he said. Mr Seiger said: ""Our case remains that the documents clearly show how the police investigation was effectively stopped in its tracks abruptly when the Foreign Office told the police shortly after Harry died that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity."" Northamptonshire Police previously said it was ""not informed"" by the FCO of the arrangements that allowed Mrs Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have taken legal action against the FCO A two-day judicial review hearing at the High Court in November is scheduled, with Mr Dunn's parents, Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, claiming the foreign secretary ""obstructed justice"" by allowing Mrs Sacoolas to leave the UK. Northamptonshire Police were brought into the legal claim in January. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after a crash involving her car and Mr Dunn's motorbike outside RAF Croughton The force will continue to be involved in the claim as an ""interested party"", said Mr Seiger. In December last year, Mrs Sacoolas wascharged with causing death by dangerous drivingbut an extradition request was rejected by the US. Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? US immunity 'loophole' closed after Dunn death Earlier this month the UK and US agreed to amend the ""anomaly"" which allowed Mrs Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: ""This is an ongoing legal matter and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" The FCO has been approached for comment.

The dying teenager who wanted world peace (and love)LiveLivePremier League final day: Who will stay up?

Who will qualify for Europe?  Less than a minute ago,"When Californian teenager Jeff Henigson was diagnosed with brain cancer and given two years to live, a children's charity granted him the wish of a lifetime. But Jeff didn't choose to go to Disneyland or meet his favourite footballer - Jeff just wanted world peace. In the summer of 1986, 15-year-old Jeff Henigson was riding his bike to the local electronics shop to buy the last part for a ""super laser"" he'd been building, when he was hit by a van. ""It's coming in the opposite direction and she doesn't see me and just smashes right into me,"" Jeff says. ""And I'm launched, like a rocket, 10 feet backwards. I land on the back of my head."" Jeff wasn't wearing a helmet, and was knocked unconscious. A few hours later, he woke up in hospital. He seemed to be OK, though, so he was discharged the same day. But within a few weeks Jeff began having seizures and he returned to the hospital, this time to have a CT scan of his brain. If it had shown injuries from the cycling accident, Jeff would not have been surprised. But the news was worse than that - the scan revealed a tumour. ""Two things went through my mind,"" Jeff says. ""One was a plan to lose my virginity that summer. And let's just say that did not work out. The second was to complete my laser project."" Jeff was an ambitious teenager, whose dream was to work for Nasa. He believed that the best way to impress them was to build ""the most amazing laser"" which could bounce a beam off of a reflector that had been left on the moon by Apollo 11. But the laser was also a way for him to bond with his father, a distant figure, who had served with the US Navy in World War Two. ""I didn't know at the time if that was because of the war or something else. But my father was separate, emotionally, from the rest of us. And I thought, 'Here's this thing we have in common. This fascination with science. This fascination with space.' And that's why I pursued it."" Though Jeff's father never mentioned his experiences in the Pacific when the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he would talk, at length, about nuclear weapons, the nuclear threat and the US's relationship with the USSR. And this seems to have had an impact on Jeff. Jeff's father, Bob Henigson ""There was a fictional film in the early 1980s called The Day After. It was about the Soviet Union dropping nuclear bombs on the US. I was probably 11 years old, and I was scared out of my mind. I would often fall asleep at night and go straight into a nightmare about nuclear war,"" Jeff remembers. Jeff hoped not only that he would get that dream job with Nasa, but that the organisation would start to work with the USSR rather than competing with it. ""Even when I was fairly young, I could see the potential for collaboration between the US and Soviet Union,"" he says. ""It just never made sense to me that we were pointing nuclear weapons at each other, when we could be collaborating to do extraordinary things in space."" As it happened, Jeff didn't only fail to lose his virginity, he didn't have time to finish his laser either. He needed surgery - quickly. After spending almost six hours on the table, doctors were able to remove the tumour in its entirety. He then faced a seven-day wait to find out whether it was cancerous. ""The doctor walks in, and I could just tell from the look on her face she was not going to deliver good news. She told me, 'I'm very sorry to say you have brain cancer and it's a very aggressive, fast-growing type of cancer,'"" Jeff says. He asked how long he had to live. ""Maybe two years,"" was the doctor's reply. Jeff began radiation and chemotherapy treatments and tried his best to keep up with his school work. He also got involved with a support group for teenagers with cancer. Listen to Jeff talking on Outlook, on the BBC World Service (producer Thomas Harding Assinder) Download the Outlook podcast ""They'd tell me all about the things they'd done - going to Disneyland or meeting a famous athlete. And I'd say, 'Oh, I thought that wish thing was for little kids,' and they said, 'We're kids.' I just didn't see myself that way."" Helping the teenagers to do these things was an organisation called the Starlight Children's Foundation. Jeff's mum made contact with them on his behalf, and a couple of volunteers, Matt and Teri, came over to his house in South Pasadena to talk about his wishes. ""I said, 'I just have to ask, can you guys possibly get me on the next space shuttle mission?' They just looked at me like 'Oh, you're so ridiculous,' and said, 'Absolutely not.'"" Matt and Teri asked Jeff if he had a second wish, and yes, he did. He'd recently re-watched The Day After - the film that had given him terrible nightmares about nuclear war a few years earlier - and had visited the library to do more research. ""I was really feeling angry that we were investing so much in nuclear weapons. I thought maybe it would be a good idea to invest in cancer research instead,"" he says. So he told Matt and Teri: ""I would like to travel to the Soviet Union and meet with Mikhail Gorbachev, so we can discuss a plan to bring an end to nuclear weapons and the Cold War."" There was a pause. Matt and Teri then asked Jeff if he had a third wish, probably hoping it would be something easier to satisfy. But he didn't want anything else. ""I said, 'I totally understand if you can't make this happen, but it's my only wish.'"" Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR in 1985 Amazingly, the Starlight Foundation started trying to make it a reality. They arranged for Jeff to join a trip to the Soviet Union with an organisation called Youth Ambassadors of America. Then they started contacting people they thought might have connections to Gorbachev. They told him that they'd try their best, but couldn't promise that it would happen. Jeff had an image in his head of what the Soviet Union would be like - thanks in part to films like Red Dawn, released in 1984, in which the US is invaded by the Soviet Union and her allies. ""These films portrayed the Soviets as hardcore militants who were determined to destroy the United States. I must say, I went to see a militant country with a militant people,"" Jeff admits. ""And I was quite surprised by the people I actually met."" Jeff in Moscow with Youth Ambassadors of America, in April 1988 The Youth Ambassadors were determined to see if they could spot any spies - keeping an eye out for furtive glances and trench coats as they toured the country. They were disappointed to not find any in Leningrad, but when they were walking through Moscow, a member of the group noticed that they were being followed. ""We were like, 'No way! Are you serious?' And he was like, 'I'm totally sure! Every time I turn around, he turns and looks at whatever's next to him.' It was right out of a movie. And he was wearing a trenchcoat. It was great."" One of the teenagers came up with the idea of counting down from three and spinning around at the same time to say hello in Russian to the man they believed was following them. Jeff was hesitant, he didn't want to risk losing his meeting with Gorbachev. ""But finally I give in. So we do the countdown, and all spin around and yellprivyet, and the guy turns around and looks at a wall - there was nothing to look at. It was classic."" In their hotel rooms, they noticed that there were sections of each wall where the wallpaper didn't quite match. One of the Youth Ambassadors decided to poke a hole and found a microphone inside. They were being listened to. ""I guess the only thing that freaked me out was when one of the girls went back to her room and found two guys going through all of her stuff,"" Jeff says. ""That was a little disturbing. I was wondering if they would go through my things. I had a present for Mr Gorbachev and I didn't want them to steal that. It was my high school yearbook, which everyone in my school had signed. It was a silly little gift, but I liked it and I hoped he would too."" Jeff kept being told that people were working on getting him a meeting with Gorbachev. Then one day he was told to put on the suit that he'd brought for the occasion, and be in the lobby at 8am the next day. ""I wanted to know what his hopes were for bringing an end to nuclear weapons,"" Jeff says. ""But I also wanted to tell him about American kids, what we wanted in this world, and how it wasn't that different from what Soviet kids wanted. We wanted to learn things, travel the world, visit each other's countries. None of these things were facilitated through this militant stance that our countries took towards one another, so I wanted to talk to him about that and see what he had to say."" Soviet participants in the Moscow youth conference However at the very moment his hopes seemed about to be realised, they were suddenly dashed. As he waited anxiously in the lobby, a man from Gorbachev's office came to deliver the news that he was unavailable to meet Jeff. When Jeff responded that he'd be free the next day, he was told that Gorbachev would never be available to meet him. ""Who knows what brought an end to that meeting with Gorbachev,"" Jeff says. ""Maybe it was never planned in the first place. I was pretty devastated."" But the man went on to say that they'd arranged an introduction for him to another important figure. Jeff was told to pack an overnight bag, and was driven by limousine to the countryside. He wasn't told anything about the man he was going to meet. ""There was this lovely couple there, and they welcomed me to their home. We ended up having a really lovely experience, and incredible conversations over a fine dinner. They were talking about all sorts of philosophical notions for a better Earth, for how our countries could co-exist,"" Jeff fondly recalls. I wasn't until he returned to Moscow and told one of his co-ordinators the name of the family he had had such a wonderful time with that he realised who he'd had dinner with. ""She said, 'You met with Evgeny Velikhov? Do you realise who he is?'"" Mikhail Gorbachev's nuclear adviser and Jeff's host, Evgeny Velikhov Velikhov was one of the country's top nuclear physicists, she explained, and Gorbachev's right hand man when it came to nuclear weapons. He hadn't met Gorbachev, but he had spent the evening talking to a man who played a key role in arms negotiations. With the Youth Ambassadors conference over, and his signed yearbook safely delivered to Gorbachev's assistant, Jeff flew back home to California. His parents met him at the airport, but it wasn't really the welcome reception he'd been expecting. Much to his dismay, neither his mother nor his father asked a single question about his trip. When he raised the subject, it was his father who spoke. ""My dad said, 'I have a question - did you meet with Mikhail Gorbachev?' I said, 'No.' And that was the end of the dialogue. It made me feel like a failure."" Jeff had finished his treatment before the trip, so he now went back to normal life and school. Then one day, a month and a half later, he received a phone call from Moscow. ""I ran to pick it up and it's Jack Matlock Jr, the US ambassador to the Soviet Union. And he says, 'Son, we have thousands and thousands of letters here that are all addressed to you.'"" Jeff had spoken to a well-known journalist in Leningrad, who had published a story about Jeff's last wish to visit the Soviet Union. At the end of the piece, he had invited people to write letters to Jeff. And thousands of people from across the Soviet Union had done so. Jeff being interviewed by journalist Nikolai Sivach ""Mr Matlock said to me, 'Listen, we're not the US Postal Service, we can't send you all of these, but we'll send you a sampling. And son, good luck.'"" Jeff only received a couple of letters in English, but the school's Russian teacher translated the headline of the news story for him - ""In leaving, I will stay"". A reference to his cancer. ""It made me feel like death was close again and I no longer wanted to be the kid with cancer. So I ended up taking those letters, putting them in a box, and writing 'nostalgia' in block letters on the top."" But despite the grim warning given by the hospital doctor, Jeff's death was not in fact close. He hid the box away, and kept living his life. Time ticked by, and his tumour didn't return. He moved to London to study at the London School of Economics and then back to the US to attend Columbia University. He started working for the United Nations. Still no tumour. Then one day in the summer of 2008, when he was 37, Jeff returned to his childhood bedroom with his then-wife. He was throwing away what he no longer needed or wanted, organising the things he did, and boxing up the laser project that had been interrupted all those years ago. And as he went through everything, he found the box with 'nostalgia' written on the top. He was at a low point in his life, Jeff says. He had been forced to leave his job at the UN because of seizures caused by scar tissue in his brain. His marriage also was coming to an end. This time, the box held a fascination for him. ""The letters, somewhat overwhelming 20 years before as I wanted to disassociate myself from cancer, were welcome the second time around,"" he says. He found a letter in the stack that was written in good English - and there was a phone number. He checked what time it was in St Petersburg and decided to call. The phone rang three times, and a woman answered in Russian. Jeff asked if, by any chance, her name was Svetlana. And it was. Twenty-three years earlier she had written him a letter in response to the article. She was shocked that he was still alive, and offered to help him translate the remaining letters, and track down others who had taken the time to write too. Envelope of letter to Jeff from reader of the article in Smena, June 1988 ""A number of volunteers translated the letters for me - one in particular, Eugenia Zhurbinskaya. I knew early on that I wanted to connect with these people. I was interested in documentary film-making, and a couple of film-makers I discussed my story with encouraged me to assemble a film crew, return to Russia, and interview the people who had written to me."" In the Summer of 2011, Jeff got on a plane with a film crew and flew to St Petersburg for 10 days to meet several of the original letter-writers that his contacts had located. He later returned twice more, but no film was ever made. ""Some of the stories were absolutely stunning,"" Jeff recalls. ""There was this woman, Nina Ivanovna Dmitrieva, she was in her 80s then, who had been walking down the street in Leningrad as a child in the 1940s when she hears this rumbling in the sky and a bomb detonates over the building next to her, which collapsed on top of her and crushed her skull. They took her to the hospital, and she goes through three brain surgeries during the siege of Leningrad, and still managed to survive. The area she had the surgery was exactly the same area where I had my tumour. That was mind-blowing. She felt like I was her child."" Nina Ivanovna Dmitrieva, who survived the siege of Leningrad Jeff fondly recalls a woman called Nelly Slepkova, then in her 80s, who had been a geologist. ""She told me that they looked for uranium. When I asked what for, she looked at me like, 'You idiot!' And she said, 'To build nuclear weapons, of course.'"" Nelly Slepkova, geologist Jeff also had the opportunity to meet the journalist who had written the story about him all those years ago. Journalist Nikolai Sivach in 2011 ""We had a pretty intense interaction. He kept wanting to communicate his success, but unlike every other Russian I'd met on that trip, all the letter writers, he did not talk about his family. I finally asked him about it and he slows down and looks at me and says, 'I had a very difficult relationship with my father.' And there was something I understood there because I hadn't resolved my relationship with my father."" This took a long time. In the Christmas holidays of 2013 Jeff went to visit his parents, and confronted his dad about how emotionally distant he had been. He told him how difficult he had found it being his son. ""When I finished, he thought for a moment and said, 'It is difficult to have lain against me, accusations...' And I just felt this anger building up in me, but he continued, 'identical to those I laid against my own father.'"" For the first time, Jeff's father opened up to his son about his childhood. His father had been a Hollywood producer, he said, and a gambling addict. ""He'd bring a small fortune home from a well-performing film to his ever-neurotic wife, and then he'd lose it in a late-night card game."" He rarely had anything to say to his children, though they were witnesses to his anger, and he showed little interest in their lives. ""My father repeated the distance, but not the lack of care. He provided for us. He took us on vacation. He came home each night for dinner, even if it was an hour or three later than my friends' suppers with their families. He just couldn't make the emotional connection. He couldn't express feelings,"" Jeff says. Jeff with his parents, Robert and Phyllis Henigson ""Not long after that, he gathered the family for the first and only time, and told us all that he loved us. He died a month later. So I am absolutely grateful that we found our peace."" Jeff is now 49 and working as a writer. His first book, Warhead, is about his own experiences, and he is following it up with a young adult novel. A recent MRI scan of his brain has given him a clean bill of health, though he expects to live with epilepsy for the rest of his life. He's still occasionally in touch with some of the Russian letter-writers, or their English-speaking grandchildren. Nelly, the geologist, is well. Sadly, he hasn't heard for a while from Nina, the survivor of the siege of Leningrad. Jeff regrets that a trusting relationship between the US and Russia seems very far away, and remains anxious about their vast nuclear stockpiles, and the danger of further nuclear proliferation which he believes ""presents a very real and ever-growing threat to human existence"". ""Iran seems determined to obtain nukes, and Turkey and Saudi Arabia will not sit idly by if Iran succeeds. The US has withdrawn from one key nuclear disarmament treaty, the INF treaty, and has signalled that another, New START, will not be extended,"" he says. ""Russia is investing in new nuclear weapons systems and China is on pace to double its nuclear stockpile in the next decade. While I no longer wake up in a cold sweat, I think nuclear war is becoming increasingly likely. There is much to worry about.""

Watford Watford captain Troy Deeney speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live:""Itâs not about todayâs game, itâs a year of not being good
enough. We can be frustrated with today but if we canât defend as a team youâre
going to lose more games than you win. But itâs worse for the fans and those who work at the club theyâre the ones
that might lose their jobs and it isnât fair on them. ""The club from top to bottom
will need to do an audit. Because sacking three managers in one season means we
havenât got it right. Something went wrong, is that managers, is that players
is it ownership? We need to audit that and go through it all to see what went
wrong. ""One thing Iâm certainly not going to do is come out here and
make excuses, we just havenât been good enough basically. ""Iâm 32 years old, Iâve a knee operation next week because Iâve
been playing injured for the last month. I honestly donât know if this is going
to be my last game at Watford or in the Premier League. I donât know, itâs too
early to talk about that and itâs not about me itâs about the people at the
club who work at the club and will be affected. Iâll take a few days away,
assess and take some grief online no doubt. ""But you know if I do ultimately stop playing for Watford as
of now Iâve had a great run, next week or the week after is going to be 10 years at this club. That donât happen often, I think the whole country has had
enough of Covid and Iâm right in that. Basicallly Iâm going to go and get
my knee sorted and go and spend some time with my family and at the end of the
day theyâre the only people whose opinions I care about. If someone wants to
give me grief online then please do it. Iâm a big boy with big shoulders and Iâve
had some real world issues so getting some stick online doesnât bother me. ""I have had my say in the dressing room trying to be as
positive and as real as I can be, players come and go fans and clubs and
legacies will be there a lot longer than us. The bigger picture is the club,
the people whose jobs are here and how we can safeguard those. Iâm sorry if I
didnât answer your question but I donât want to make it about me or the other
players, we know we havenât been good enough the table reflects that. But itâs
all about re-building and if this is my last game for the club Iâve had a good
run. Highest of highs and lowest of the lows, this will be the lowest one yet."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
GPs to prescribe cycling in new obesity strategySurgeries will also provide access to bikes and ministers promise cycling infrastructure will improve.UK,"GPs will be encouraged prescribe cycling where appropriate Boris Johnson will set out his strategy to tackle obesity on Monday - including a 12-week plan for people to lose weight and GPs prescribing cycling. It comes after Public Health England research found that being overweight or obese puts people at greater riskof serious illness or death from Covid-19. Ministers estimate that about two-thirds of adults in the UK are above a healthy weight. Labour said ""radical action"" on obesity was long overdue. It is not yet clear how much new money will be allocated to the anti-obesity drive. Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say How bad is our obesity problem? Mr Johnson has admitted that his own weight was a factor in how badly he suffered from coronavirus. The government estimates that overweight and obesity related conditions are costing the NHS more than Â£6bn each year. There were nearly 900,000 obesity related hospital admissions in 2018/19, with obesity a risk factor for chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, some cancers, liver and respiratory disease. The ""Better Health"" campaign will aim to reach 35 million people in a bid ""to help them lose weight and live healthier lives"", the government said. This will be supported by a 12-week plan that people can use to develop healthier eating habits, get more active and lose weight. It's an issue that has grown in the last two decades -   with obesity rates rising steeply in England between 1993 and 2000 and continuing to go up more gradually in the years since then. In 2018 official statistics show around 36% of the adult population in England were overweight and 28% were obese.  And the burden is not shared equally across society - people living in deprived areas are more likely to be admitted to hospital with a condition related to obesity. What's clear is that it can start in childhood. In England one in ten children in reception year are obese and that rises to one in five by the end of primary school. That's why the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has described obesity as ""one of the greatest threats"" to children and society as a whole. And these problems are not unique to England - with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland experiencing very similar levels.  But around the world the picture does vary.  Less than 10% of adults in South Korea and Japan are obese, compared to 40% in the US. Boris Johnson will be hoping that his new measures will move the UK closer to healthier nations. A government spokesman said: ""Covid-19 has given us all a wake-up call of the immediate and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is clear we must use this moment to get healthier, more active and eat better. ""We will be urging the public to use this moment to take stock of how they live their lives, and to take simple steps to lose weight, live healthier lives, and reduce pressure on the NHS."" Under the plans, NHS weight loss services will be expanded so more people get support, and GPs will be encouraged to prescribe cycling in pilot areas identified as having poor health outcomes. Surgeries will provide access to bikes and ministers are promising local cycling infrastructure will be improved. This may include segregated cycle lanes, low traffic neighbourhoods and secure cycle parking. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' The government is also expected to ban junk food adverts online and before 21:00 on TV, while promotions on snacks will be curbed. According tothe Daily Mail,external, restaurant and takeaway chains will have to publish the number of calories in the meals they serve - while shops will have to do the same with any alcohol they sell. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said we could all think a bit more about our lifestyles - himself included. ""I seemed to eat my way through the first half of lockdown and then I lost a bit of weight in the second half when I started to think about it more. ""But I think more generally we need to take some personal responsibility,"" he said on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Meanwhile, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, said tackling obesity needed a much wider approach than focusing on diet and exercise. On the same programme, he said: ""We need action around accessing nutritional food, we need to ban junk food advertisingâ¦and also these high energy drinks we can we buy  in shops - why aren't we banning them? ""Kids shouldn't be buying energy drinks in shops. I'm looking for decisive, radical action from government, not more backsliding.""

Westminster Abbey 'dealt shattering blow by virus'The dean of Westminster Abbey says it is down Â£12m this year and is set to make staff redundant.London,"The dean of Westminster Abbey, the Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, told the BBC: ""We are vulnerable and we are getting more vulnerable"" Westminster Abbey is down more than Â£12m in revenue this year and is set to make about 20% of its staff redundant as a result of the lockdown. More than 90% of its income comes from visitors paying an entrance fee. It closed its doors on 20 March and only began to reopen for limited tourist visits on 11 July. The dean of Westminster Abbey, the Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, told the BBC the coronavirus had dealt a ""shattering blow"" to the Abbey's finances. Separately, the Church of England's 42 cathedrals are projected to be down more than Â£28.4m on what they thought their budgets would be this year. They are projected to lose another Â£15.5m next year. The Association of English Cathedrals, which represents Westminster Abbey and the Church of England's 42 cathedrals, warned job cuts would hit churches around the country when the government's job retention scheme ended in October. The Abbey's financial reserves would be depleted by a third from September, Dr Hoyle said, and would continue to fall as visitor numbers were not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels for up to five years. ""There is a real need here,"" he said, warning Westminster Abbey expected a similar ""breathtaking"" loss of between Â£9m and Â£12m next year as well. The Abbey is open for services and visits, but numbers are limited as social distancing is enforced. Dr Hoyle said it was ""inconceivable"" that the Abbey would be so quiet, as in a ""normal"" month of July, it would be admitting 1,000 people an hour. ""We are vulnerable and we are getting more vulnerable,"" he said. ""We're negotiating one of the greatest challenges to hit the Abbey in recent times."" Coronavirus saw the Abbey closed for the longest time since the Queen's coronation The Abbey has already announced plans to scrap regular Sunday services at St Margaret's, a medieval church in Parliament Square. The professional choir at St Margaret's will be disbanded and worshippers will be told to merge with the congregation in the Abbey. Due to its status as a Royal Peculiar, Westminster Abbey does not count as one of the Church of England's 42 cathedrals. Instead it is owned directly by the monarch, meaning it is not eligible for funding by the Church Commissioners. While the Abbey makes most of its income from tourism, many places of worship across the UK rely on cash donations from congregations to survive. Having been forced to close their doors due to the lockdown, many are struggling financially. One Sikh temple, Singh Sabha London East, typically received about Â£80,000 a month in donations from attendees. During lockdown, despite losing 90% of its monthly income, the gurdwara provided more than 4,000 meals to NHS staff and other key workers. But Sukhbir Bassi, one of the senior figures at the gurdwara, said that could not continue without government support. ""We are having serious, serious problems,"" he said. Singh Sabha London East received Â£80,000 a month in donations before lockdown The government has pledged Â£750m in support for voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We understand the difficulty lockdown has caused people of faith, which is why we have worked in partnership with faith leaders to enable a phased and safe reopening of places of worship.""

Harry Dunn family drop legal action against police,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The parents of a young man whose death in a crash sparked an international diplomatic row have dropped their legal action against Northamptonshire Police. Harry Dunn, 19, was fatally injured outside RAF Croughton in August. His family began legal action against the force and the Foreign Office after US suspect Anne Sacoolas left the UK, citing diplomatic immunity. After seeing documents disclosed in the case the family said the ""police are absolved of any blame"". The information provided for the court proceedings showed the force ""could have done no more last August and September to ensure that Mrs Sacoolas was brought to justice"", said family spokesman Radd Seiger. Police had been ""kept in the dark"" by the FCO (Foreign & Commonwealth Office) about uncertainty relating to Mrs Sacoolas' immunity status, he said. Mr Seiger said: ""Our case remains that the documents clearly show how the police investigation was effectively stopped in its tracks abruptly when the Foreign Office told the police shortly after Harry died that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity."" Northamptonshire Police previously said it was ""not informed"" by the FCO of the arrangements that allowed Mrs Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have taken legal action against the FCO A two-day judicial review hearing at the High Court in November is scheduled, with Mr Dunn's parents, Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, claiming the foreign secretary ""obstructed justice"" by allowing Mrs Sacoolas to leave the UK. Northamptonshire Police were brought into the legal claim in January. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after a crash involving her car and Mr Dunn's motorbike outside RAF Croughton The force will continue to be involved in the claim as an ""interested party"", said Mr Seiger. In December last year, Mrs Sacoolas wascharged with causing death by dangerous drivingbut an extradition request was rejected by the US. Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? US immunity 'loophole' closed after Dunn death Earlier this month the UK and US agreed to amend the ""anomaly"" which allowed Mrs Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: ""This is an ongoing legal matter and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" The FCO has been approached for comment.

Fleetwood leads tributes to 'dearest friend' Green,"An early line-up of Fleetwood Mac (L-R): Peter Green, John McVie, Jeremy Spencer, Mick Fleetwood and Danny Kirwan Mick Fleetwood has led tributes to his ""dearest friend"" and co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green. Fleetwood said they had ""trail blazed one hell of a musical road for so many to enjoy"". And Stevie Nicks, who joined the band five years after Green quit amid struggles with his mental health, said her biggest regret was not having shared a stage with him. Green, 73, died peacefully in his sleep,his family said on Saturday. Fleetwood said: ""For me, and every past and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is monumental. ""No-one has ever stepped into the ranks of Fleetwood Mac without a reverence for Peter Green and his talent, and to the fact that music should shine bright and always be delivered with uncompromising passion."" The 73-year-old added: ""Peter, I will miss you, but rest easy your music lives on. I thank you for asking me to be your drummer all those years ago. We did good, and trail blazed one hell of a musical road for so many to enjoy. ""God speed to you, my dearest friend."" Peter Green performed at a charity event at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2004 Blues rock guitarist Green, from Bethnal Green in east London, formed Fleetwood Mac with drummer Fleetwood, bass guitarist John McVie and guitarist Jeremy Spencer in 1967. He wrote the instantly recognisable instrumental track Albatross, which remains the band's only number one hit, plus two other early hits, Black Magic Woman and Oh Well. And it was under Green's direction that they produced their first three albums. Green left the band after a last performance in 1970 as he struggled with his mental health. He was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent time in hospital in the mid-70s. Singer Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham in 1975 and the band became one of the most successful in the world. ""I am sorry to hear about the passing of Peter Green. My biggest regret is that I never got to share the stage with him. I always hoped in my heart of hearts that that would happen,"" she said. ""When I first listened to all the Fleetwood Mac records, I was very taken with his guitar playing. It was one of the reasons I was excited to join the band. ""His legacy will live on forever in the history books of Rock n Roll. It was in the beginning, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and I thank you, Peter Green, for that. You changed our lives."" Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, John McVie in 1975 David Coverdale, the lead singer of Whitesnake, is among other musicians to pay tribute to a ""truly loved and admired"" artist. In a tweet,external, he said: ""I supported the original Fleetwood Mac at Redcar Jazz Club when I was in a local band... he was a breathtaking singer, guitarist and composer. I know who I will be listening to today. RIP"" Mumford and Sons guitarist Winston Marshall tweeted: ""RIP Peter Green. #GOAT. Man of the world, oh well, albatross, need your love so bad. Some of my favourites songs and performances of all time. Thank you for the music."" Actor David Morrissey praised Green's ""fantastic soulful voice"" while Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler described Green as ""one of the greats"". And Scottish musician Midge Ure tweeted: ""One of the great ones gone. You taught me well."" The singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam, tweeted: ""God bless the ineffable Peter Green, one of the unsung heroes of musical integrity, innovation and spirit. When I heard he left Fleetwood Mac in 1970 to get a real life and donate his wealth to charity, he became something of a model for me."" Peter Green was one of the greatest Blues guitarists Britain ever produced. His shape-shifting riffs and long, improvisational excursions made Fleetwood Mac one of the most exciting live bands of the 1960s Blues explosion. He first picked up a hand-me-down guitar at the age of 10 and, like many of his peers, began to devour the import vinyl that trickled into the UK from the US. He studied the greats - Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and BB King - combining their tensely coiled playing style with the shimmering vibrato of The Shadows' Hank Marvin. But he actually started his professional career as a bassist, until an encounter with Eric Clapton persuaded him to ditch the instrument. ""I decided to go back on lead guitar after seeing him with the Bluesbreakers. He had a Les Paul, his fingers were marvellous. The guy knew how to do a bit of evil, I guess."" He later had the seemingly impossible task of taking over from Clapton in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Fans were unconvinced at first, but after a handful of incendiary performances, he won them over, earning the nickname ""The Green God"". Read morehere. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Green at number 58 in its all-time list of the100 greatest guitarists,external, describing him as ""Britain's most progressive blues guitarist"" in his heyday. He was among the eight members of the band - along with Fleetwood, Nicks, Buckingham, Spencer, McVie, Christine McVie and Danny Kirwan - who were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. The news of his death comes days after Fleetwood Mac announced they would release aretrospective box set,externaldocumenting the band's early years between 1969 and 1974. Green married Jane Samuels in January 1978. They divorced in 1979 and have a daughter.

False and misleading claims about hunt for vaccine,"In the week that Oxford University announced promising results from its coronavirus vaccine trial, we're looking at claims on social media about vaccines and misleading statements about their safety. The anti-vaccination movement has gained traction online in recent years, and campaigners opposed to vaccination have moved their focus to making claims relating to the coronavirus. First, a video containing inaccurate claims about coronavirus vaccine trials, made by osteopath Carrie Madej, that has proved popular on social media. Carrie Madej's video makes a false claim that the vaccines will change recipients' DNA (which carries genetic information). ""The Covid-19 vaccines are designed to make us into genetically modified organisms."" She also claims - without any evidence - that vaccines will ""hook us all up to an artificial intelligence interface"". Coronavirus vaccine: Might it have side-effects? There are25 different candidate vaccines,externalin clinical trials around the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but none of them will alter human DNA and they do not contain technology to link people up to an artificial intelligence interface. The vaccines are all designed to provoke an immune response by training our bodies to recognise and fight the virus. Carrie Madej makes a number of other false claims, including that vaccine trials are ""not following any sound scientific protocol to make sure this is safe"". ""New vaccines undergo rigorous safety checks before they can be recommended for widespread use,"" says Michelle Roberts, BBC online health editor. We have asked Carrie Madej for comment about these claims, but have received no response at the time of publication. It was first uploaded to YouTube in June, where it clocked more than 300,000 views, but it has also been popular on Facebook and Instagram. It's still circulating in the United States, the UK and elsewhere. There was a small protest in South Africa a week after a Covid-19 vaccine trial started in Johannesburg A scientist in South Africa, Sarah Downs, who writes under the alias Mistress of Science, said she was alerted to the video by her mother whose prayer group had shared it. The scientist sent her own debunking information to this group and says: ""They are now much better informed, which I'm so glad about, because they were all taken in by that video."" Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know When the preliminary results of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine study were publishedon Monday, the topic provoked much debate in coronavirus-focused Facebook groups. Some Facebook users posted comments saying they didn't want the vaccine as they felt they would be used as ""guinea pigs"" and that it had been ""rushed into production at warp speed"". While there might be concerns about safety given the accelerated pace of development, Prof Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told the BBC the rigorous safety processes included in all clinical trials were in place. This includes safety reports to regulators in the countries taking part. The trial has been so fast in concluding the first two phases because of the head start provided by previous work on coronavirus vaccines in Oxford, the acceleration of administrative and funding processes, and the huge interest in the trial which meant no time was spent searching for volunteers. What is it like to be a vaccine volunteer? As the trial moves to its third phase, with thousands more volunteers taking part, all the participants will be monitored for side-effects. There were no dangerous side-effects from taking the vaccine in the first two phases, though 16-18% of trial participants given the vaccine reported a fever. Researchers said side-effects could be managed with paracetamol. When the Oxford vaccine trial first started, there was a claim that the first volunteer had died. The story was quickly debunked by fact-checkers and the BBC's medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, conducted an interview with the volunteer. A meme circulating on social media claims vaccines were responsible for 50 million deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. But this is completely wrong. Firstly, as the US Centers for Disease Control states,there was no vaccine at the time,external. Scientists in Britain and the US did experiment with basic bacterial vaccines, but these were not vaccines as we would recognise them today, says historian and author Mark Honingsbaum. This was ""for the good reason that no-one knew that the influenza was a virus"". How they tried to curb Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 There were two main causes of death - the initial flu infection or from the strong enormous immune response the virus triggered leading to lungs being filled with fluids.

Premier League set for dramatic final day,"This video can not be played 'It comes down to one game' - managers on Premier League final-day survival chances Champions League qualification and the battle to avoid relegation are the major issues at stake as the Premier League season concludes on Sunday. Coronavirus prompted fears the campaign might not be completed but after 92 games in 40 days the top flight is set for a dramatic finale. Leicester City host Manchester Unitedwith both teams and Chelsea competing for the two remaining top-four spots. Two of Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth will be relegated. Europa League qualification is also up for grabs, with Wolves and Tottenham battling for sixth place, which guarantees a European place next season. Jamie Vardy is favourite to win the Golden Boot, while the Golden Glove is also up for grabs. Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne will be hoping to match - or break - an assists landmark only previously achieved by Thierry Henry, plus the Premier League will bid farewell to a legend as De Bruyne's City team-mate David Silva plays his final match in the competition. Sunday's final day fixtures in full How to watch, listen and follow the final day Who needs what to survive? Race for Europe - which clubs are likely to qualify? Remember in normal times when the television cameras loved zooming in on sobbing fans after their club had been relegated? With supporters unable to attend games because of the coronavirus pandemic, that is not going to happen this season. But fans of Bournemouth, Watford and Aston Villa are preparing for a nerve-shredding day as their clubs look toavoid joining Norwichin the Championship. After a long slog of a season, three teams separated by three points and with almost identical goal differences, are left to battle for one Premier League place. Villa, who start the day outside of the bottom three on goal difference, visit a West Ham side who are now safe, 18th-placed Watford go to FA Cup finalists Arsenal, while 19th-placed Bournemouth are at mid-table Everton. ""We can control our own destiny and that was looking unlikely,"" said Villa boss Dean Smith, whose side moved out of the bottom three with one game to go. ""We are above the dotted line but the most important thing is to be there after the game on Sunday."" Sports data analysts Gracenote have used their Euro Club Index to work out the chances of relegation for those teams trying to stay up. Bournemouth's chances of going down are rated at 95%, Watford are 77.5% while the figure is 28.5% for Villa. The Cherries may be favourites for the drop as they are reliant on both their relegation rivals losing - but manager Eddie Howe believes keeping a cool head is crucial. ""It's controlling our emotions that is going to be key because you have to play the game and you have to play the moment, be very much in the present,"" he said. ""Thinking too much, or getting too emotional, can be very counter productive so we need the players to enjoy the game, play the game as they have always done. ""I'm sure at some stage I will hear what's happening elsewhere. But we have to win regardless, so that's what I'll be working on."" Hayden Mullins, in charge of Watford following Nigel Pearson's surprise sacking, knows his side must better Villa's result. ""If we need to get messages onto the pitch we will but they just need to concentrate on their jobs,"" he said. With all of Sunday's games kicking off at 16:00 BST, expect tears to be flowing around 17:50 - just not from fans in stadiums, as we have become used to on the last day of the league season. For a detailed explanation of the permutations at the bottom,click here. With champions Liverpool and runners-up Manchester City having booked their places in next season's Champions League, Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester United are battling it out for the final two group-stage spots. United, who are third, will guarantee a top-four finish if they avoid defeat at fifth-placed Leicester. FA Cup finalists Chelsea, who are one point clear of Leicester, just need a point against sixth-placed Wolves to secure a place. Leicester will guarantee a spot in the top four by beating Manchester United. ""We'll approach the game to win it - I don't think there's any other way,"" said Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. This video can not be played FA Cup: Chelsea's Christian Pulisic says top four and trophy would be 'massive' Meanwhile, Wolves will qualify for the Europa League for a second successive season if they win at Chelsea. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United were six points off the top four after a2-0 home defeat by Burnleyon 22 January. They go into the final day with an 88% chance of making the Champions League, according to Gracenote, as do Chelsea. Leicester's chances are rated at 70%. ""We want the players to learn about the traditions and history of the club and what the players before them have done,"" Solskjaer told Sky Sports. ""The club's former players have played so many vital games at the end of the season - a cup final, a game to win the league, a game to get into the Champions League. ""The players now are learning what the other players through history have been through."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said: ""This is virtually like a barrier-breaking goal, a goal that will get us into the Champions League. ""It wasn't really something we spoke about at the beginning of the season because naturally, where the club had been these last few seasons, we wanted to try step-by-step to arrive there."" Click here for a more detailed explanation of the race for the Europe. Eight years ago, Jamie Vardy was playing non-league football for Fleetwood Town. On Sunday, the Leicester striker could win the Golden Boot awarded to the leading Premier League scorer. Vardy, 33, is top of the scoring charts with 23 goals, two ahead of Southampton's Danny Ings, his nearest rival for the award. While Vardy goes into the Foxes' final game at home to Manchester United without a goal in his past two appearances, Ings has scored six times in eight matches since the restart for Southampton, who entertain Sheffield United. This video can not be played Jamie Vardy: the Fleetwood Town story Should Vardy and Ings seal the top two places, it will be the first time two English forwards have finished top of the scoring charts outright since 1999-2000, when Sunderland's Kevin Phillips scored 30 and Newcastle's Alan Shearer got 23. In 2015-16, Vardy shared runners-up spot with Manchester City's Argentina forward Sergio Aguero - the pair ending the season on 24 goals, one behind Tottenham's Harry Kane. With Manchester City's Raheem Sterling on 19 goals, there is a chance English forwards could fill the top three places, although Arsenal's Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (20) and Liverpool's Egypt forward Mohamed Salah (19) might have something to say about that. This video can not be played Lineker calls out Ings for being coy on Golden Boot hopes Premier League top scorers Burnley against Brighton is one of the few games on the final day with little riding on it. The Clarets start ninth after another solid season while the Seagulls have secured their safety. But it is a huge game for Nick Pope as he chases the prestigious Golden Glove - the award for the goalkeeper who keeps the most clean sheets in a Premier League season. The Clarets stopper has managed an impressive 15 shutouts - the same number as Manchester City's Brazil keeper Ederson. This video can not be played Burnley manager Sean Dyche praises goalkeeper Nick Pope's performance at Liverpool Pope will become the first English winner of the award since City's Joe Hart in 2014-15 if Burnley do not concede against Brighton - and relegated Norwich score at Pep Guardiola's runners-up. If Pope and Ederson finish on the same number of clean sheets, the award will be shared for the first time since 2013-14 when Chelsea's Petr Cech and Arsenal's Wojciech Szczesny were tied on 16 shutouts. Although there will be no supporters present, Silva will be fighting back the tears when he makes his 309th and final Premier League appearance for Manchester City. The former Spain playmaker, 34, is regarded as one of the club's greatest-ever players, a key figure in transforming City into the dominant domestic force over the past few years. Silva, who has helped the club win 11 major trophies in 10 years,announced in June he would leaveat the end of the 2019-20 season, adding: ""Ten years for me is enough. It's the perfect time for me."" Since arriving fromValencia for Â£24m in July 2010,,externalhe has provided 93 assists in the Premier League and scored 60 goals.

""I know he's loved by City fans and appreciated far beyond Etihad Stadium, but I'm still not sure he quite gets all the wider accolades he deserves for what he's brought to English football since he arrived in 2010,"" said former City defender Micah Richards.

Crash warning as more bikers hit roads in lockdown,"Police have clocked motorcyclists speeding on roads in the Brecon Beacons during lockdown More motorcyclists could be seriously injured on Welsh roads as people avoid public transport, experts have warned. Last year 247 bikers were seriously injured or killed in Wales. Police said nearly 50,000 motorbikes had been counted on roads in one weekend in lockdown. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) said greater awareness was needed from all road users in order to cut deaths. RoSPA safety officer Michelle Harrington said Wales' ""spectacular"" scenery meant people in England were increasingly coming across the border to ride. ""Given the reluctance to use public transport we could see even more motorcyclists on our roads,"" she said. ""Motorcyclists tend to come off the worst, what would normally be a small bump for someone in a car would cause serious injury. ""It is a tragedy for everyone affected, but often people do not think about it until they are involved in a crash or someone they love has been hurt."" Police are now using technology to track hot spots to send officers and help prevent crashes During the first few months of lockdown, police accused some motorists of using quieter roads as""racing tracks"", with data revealing more accidents happened in fine weather. Trauma consultant sees rise in biker injuries in lockdown Driven to his death: Mystery of motorcyclist body on M4 Motorbike rider in shorts and flip flops badly injured Police figures, from road safety campaign Operation Darwen, show a ""significant increase"" in bikers using Welsh roads after travel restrictions were eased. Ch Insp Tom Sharville, from Dyfed-Powys Police, said on Saturday 11 June, 22,000 bikers were counted on roads, rising to nearly 27,000 on the Sunday. This is compared to about 4,500 bikes on an average weekday, he said. ""The number of collisions involving bikes during the first weekend saw a demand on resources that had not been there in previous weekends during lockdown,"" he said. Police across Wales are now using technology to try and stop crashes, using live sensors under trunk roads to record hot spots to get officers on the scene quickly. Ch Ins Sharville said: ""It's not about targeting bikers, or trying to catch them out - rather it focuses on ensuring the safety of riders in Wales."" Statistics for 2019 595accidents 22bikers killed 84%of accidents happened in fine weather 25%happened at a junction Latest statistics show,externalthat of the 5,789 people hurt in accidents on Welsh roads in 2019, 595 (10.27%) were motorcyclists. Of these, 22 bikers were killed. Half of these fatal accidents happened in the Dyfed-Powys Police area. In 2013, the Welsh Government set a target to reduce the number of bikers killed or seriously hurt in accidents by 25% by 2020. But numbers, when compared with data from 2004-08, have only fallen by 3.9%. Ms Harrington said biker numbers had increased in recent years, making the target harder to reach, and numbers were expected to be higher as people avoided public transport due to coronavirus. Wales' scenery and twisting roads are popular with bikers from across the UK South Wales Advanced Motorcycle Group said its members had been ""appalled"" by the reckless behaviour during lockdown of a small number of bikers who were giving responsible riders a ""bad name"". ""There are a lot of really well behaved motorcyclists, but they are almost invisible to the general public,"" said chairman Dave Hutton. ""A lot of members of our group have volunteered as blood bike riders during lockdown, helping to save lives across the UK, and many have been acting as local community champions, helping deliver shopping and prescriptions to people who are isolating."" Mr Hutton said motorcyclists were very difficult to spot and very easy for drivers to miss when turning or pulling out at a junction, making them very vulnerable. ""There was a time when you would expect to see several police vehicles on a stretch of road, but now you can go on a long journey and not see any at all,"" he said. ""Welsh roads are some of the best in the UK. There's a very large shared border, the roads here are very bendy and very fast, which some motorcyclists like."" Mr Hutton said motorbike companies were using fears over public transport to boost sales during lockdown, though bikes were a great alternative for easing congestion in cities. However, he added, issues tended to be with younger riders and ""born again bikers"", who go back on the roads without new training. ""You can enjoy the thrills and still stay perfectly within the law, and if you do anything that is not within the law you will not pass,"" he said. Residents living near the rural A4215 between Libanus and Defynnog met two years ago following a fatal crash For years, residents living near the 60mph A4215 between Libanus and Defynnog, in Powys, have been campaigning for safety measures on the road after a number of fatalities. ""When someone pulls out, no-one can see properly and it can mean game over,"" said resident Anita Denny. She said people were now scared to leave their homes as more people travelled to the area in the summer and during lockdown, with near misses and crashes. Ms Denny said that while the majority of road users were well behaved, going to the shops could mean driving head on into lorries, motorbikes and cars. In recent weeks, Dyfed-Powys Police said they had caughtmotorcyclists going 127 mph on the Brecon bypass near Pen y Fan, while all forcescaptured motorists speeding across Wales during lockdown. Residents have taken it upon themselves to put up signs Fay Jones, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, visited the road on 19 July. ""I am well aware that many bikers use the road responsibly, and I am very keen to ensure they keep enjoying the Brecon Beacons and all that we have to offer, but any vehicle speeding is unsafe, inconsiderate and needs to stop,"" she said. Ms Jones said the Army had agreed to stop sending lorries down the road and Powys council had been supportive of improving safety measures, and was discussing measures with Dyfed-Powys Police. She said she was arranging a meeting with Google Maps to discuss how to stop people being sent down the road by sat-navs. Police said they clocked many people breaking speed limits during lockdown While the number of fatal accidents has fallen steadily over recent years, last year there was a slight increase in the number of accidents on Welsh roads, with 2.5% more compared with 2018. And while Gwent Police recorded the smallest number of accidents, it saw the biggest increase in collisions, from 632 to 715 - 32%. The force said the rise could be down to a change in more accurate reporting systems, and an increase in traffic on roads following the removal of the tolls on the Prince of Wales bridge and the M48 Severn Bridge. Ms Harrington said many dangerous roads in Wales had been ""designed out"" and most accidents were down to human error, such as drivers not seeing bikers. She said that, as biker numbers increased, greater awareness was needed by all road users, but that it was proving hard to get motorcyclists to attend road safety courses put on to reduce accidents. ""We find there is a reluctance, sometimes local authorities do not fill the spaces, possibly because motorcyclists think 'I've been driving for 20 years, what can they teach me?',"" she said. Road safety partnership, Go Safe, said motorcyclists were ""specifically vulnerable"" and the police had engaged with bikers to increase safety through Operation Darwen. The Welsh Government said it took road safety ""extremely seriously"" and every death was ""one too many"". ""We continue to work with our partners to achieve the targets set out in the Road Safety Framework for Wales and ensure roads are safe for all users,"" a spokesman said.

PM to set out strategy to tackle obesity in UK,"GPs will be encouraged prescribe cycling where appropriate Boris Johnson will set out his strategy to tackle obesity on Monday - including a 12-week plan for people to lose weight and GPs prescribing cycling. It comes after Public Health England research found that being overweight or obese puts people at greater riskof serious illness or death from Covid-19. Ministers estimate that about two-thirds of adults in the UK are above a healthy weight. Labour said ""radical action"" on obesity was long overdue. It is not yet clear how much new money will be allocated to the anti-obesity drive. Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say How bad is our obesity problem? Mr Johnson has admitted that his own weight was a factor in how badly he suffered from coronavirus. The government estimates that overweight and obesity related conditions are costing the NHS more than Â£6bn each year. There were nearly 900,000 obesity related hospital admissions in 2018/19, with obesity a risk factor for chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, some cancers, liver and respiratory disease. The ""Better Health"" campaign will aim to reach 35 million people in a bid ""to help them lose weight and live healthier lives"", the government said. This will be supported by a 12-week plan that people can use to develop healthier eating habits, get more active and lose weight. It's an issue that has grown in the last two decades -   with obesity rates rising steeply in England between 1993 and 2000 and continuing to go up more gradually in the years since then. In 2018 official statistics show around 36% of the adult population in England were overweight and 28% were obese.  And the burden is not shared equally across society - people living in deprived areas are more likely to be admitted to hospital with a condition related to obesity. What's clear is that it can start in childhood. In England one in ten children in reception year are obese and that rises to one in five by the end of primary school. That's why the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has described obesity as ""one of the greatest threats"" to children and society as a whole. And these problems are not unique to England - with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland experiencing very similar levels.  But around the world the picture does vary.  Less than 10% of adults in South Korea and Japan are obese, compared to 40% in the US. Boris Johnson will be hoping that his new measures will move the UK closer to healthier nations. A government spokesman said: ""Covid-19 has given us all a wake-up call of the immediate and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is clear we must use this moment to get healthier, more active and eat better. ""We will be urging the public to use this moment to take stock of how they live their lives, and to take simple steps to lose weight, live healthier lives, and reduce pressure on the NHS."" Under the plans, NHS weight loss services will be expanded so more people get support, and GPs will be encouraged to prescribe cycling in pilot areas identified as having poor health outcomes. Surgeries will provide access to bikes and ministers are promising local cycling infrastructure will be improved. This may include segregated cycle lanes, low traffic neighbourhoods and secure cycle parking. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

According tothe Daily Mail,external, restaurant and takeaway chains will have to publish the number of calories in the meals they serve - while shops will have to do the same with any alcohol they sell. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said we could all think a bit more about our lifestyles - himself included. ""I seemed to eat my way through the first half of lockdown and then I lost a bit of weight in the second half when I started to think about it more. ""But I think more generally we need to take some personal responsibility,"" he said on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Meanwhile, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, said tackling obesity needed a much wider approach than focusing on diet and exercise. On the same programme, he said: ""We need action around accessing nutritional food, we need to ban junk food advertisingâ¦and also these high energy drinks we can we buy  in shops - why aren't we banning them? ""Kids shouldn't be buying energy drinks in shops. I'm looking for decisive, radical action from government, not more backsliding.""
