Bullet 'centimetres' from London Bridge witness,"A bullet missed a man by centimetres as police fired on the London Bridge attackers, an inquest has heard. Simon Edwards was in the Wheatsheaf pub in Borough Market when police shot dead the three knife-wielding assailants outside, the Old Bailey heard. The inquest into the deaths of their eight victims was shown a CCTV image of the moment a stray shot came through the pub window close to Mr Edwards. The bullet hit a man behind Mr Edwards in the head, seriously injuring him. Giving evidence to the inquest, Mr Edwards said a friend of his rushed to give first aid to that man, Neil McLellan, and he survived. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack US man 'flatlined twice' after London attack Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, killed eight people in the van and knife attack on the evening of 3 June 2017. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. Khuram Butt tried to enter the Wheatsheaf pub in Borough Maket Mr Edwards had actually just left the Wheatsheaf pub when he saw three armed men walking towards him, he told the court. He said people were screaming and his wife Nicole dragged him back into the pub, where a member of staff locked the door. Butt tried to enter the pub by forcing the door open. He seemed ""calm"" and ""determined"", Mr Edwards told the Old Bailey. He said Butt had ""canisters"" strapped to him, which later turned out to be part of a fake suicide vest. by Harriet Agerholm, BBC News reporter, at the inquests Simon Edwards had been out for a meal and then drinks with his wife and friends when the London Bridge attackers went on their murderous rampage. Suspense grew in the courtroom as Mr Edwards described how Butt repeatedly tried to kick down the door of the Wheatsheaf pub as scared people hid inside. All that secured the door was a single bolt at the top, and the bottom of it flexed with the force of his kicks, he said. After failing to kick his way in, Butt began smashing the window panes surrounding the door with the handle of his knife, Mr Edwards said. His voice shook as he told the Old Bailey that Butt only stopped when he saw Redouane and Zaghba set upon a man outside the pub All three descended on the victim ""like a pack of wolves"", Mr Edwards said in a statement. Making a stabbing movement with his arm, Mr Edwards demonstrated how they knifed the man repeatedly, ""trying to inflict as much injury as they could"". While the attackers were stabbing the man in the street, the pub ""filled with blue lights"" as armed police arrived outside, Mr Edwards said. He told the court there were several volleys of bullets and he dropped to his knees to take cover. After noticing there was ""quite a lot of blood"" coming from Mr McLellan's head, he opened the door to shout to police for medical help. He discovered later that he too had been cut by shrapnel from the bullet. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

The Bitter Sweet Symphony dispute is over,"This video can not be played The Verve's Richard Ashcroft on the end of Bitter Sweet Symphony dispute One of rock music's most famous injustices has finally been resolved. For the last 22 years, The Verve haven't made a penny from Bitter Sweet Symphony, after forfeiting the royalties to The Rolling Stones. The song was embroiled in a legal battle shortly after its release, as it samples anorchestral version of The Stones' song The Last Time.,external As a result, writer Richard Ashcroft had to sign over his rights to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards - until now. Speaking as he received a lifetime achievement prize at the Ivor Novello Awards, Ashcroft announced: ""As of last month, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards signed over all their publishing for Bitter Sweet Symphony, which was a truly kind and magnanimous thing for them to do."" As a result, all future royalties for the song will now go to Ashcroft. The singer acknowledged that it was the Rolling Stones' late manager, Allen Klein, who had been responsible for the situation, rather than the musicians themselves. ""I never had a personal beef with the Stones,"" he told the BBC. ""They've always have been the greatest rock and roll band in the world."" He went on to thank Jagger and Richards for acknowledging he was responsible ""for this [expletive] masterpiece"". Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

According to Rolling Stone magazine,external, the royalty dispute arose in 1997 when The Verve sought permission to sample a short, staccato string sequence from the symphonic version of The Last Time, recorded in 1965 by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra. The Stones agreed to license a five-note segment in exchange for 50 percent of the royalties, but Klein claimed the Verve voided the agreement by using a larger portion of the song. ABKCO Records, Klein's holding company, filed a plagiarism case, after which The Verve relinquished all their royalties and publishing rights to ABKCO, and the song credit reverted to Jagger and Richards. The situation rankled The Verve for years. ""We were told it was going to be a 50/50 split,"" recalled bassist Simon Jones. ""Then they saw how well the record was doing they rung up and said, 'We want 100 percent or take it out of the shops, you don't have much choice.'"" The bitterest pill came when the song was nominated for a best song Grammy - with Jagger and Richards' names on the ballot. Asked in 1999 if he believed The Verve had been treated fairly, the Stones' guitarist replied: ""I'm out of whack here, this is serious lawyer [stuff]."" However, he added: ""If the Verve can write a better song, they can keep the money."" Ashcroft told the BBC that the dispute came to an end following negotiations with Klein's son, and the Rolling Stones new manager Joyce Smyth. ""It's been a fantastic development,"" he said. ""It's life-affirming in a way."" One unexpected benefit is that the singer can once again enjoy international football. ""They play it [Bitter Sweet Symphony] before England play. So I can sit back and watch England... and finally just enjoy the moment."" In a statement, The Rolling Stones acknowledged that Ashcroft had been denied the rights to ""one of his most iconic songs, including the lyrical content"" for more than two decades. ""Of course there was a huge financial cost but any songwriter will know that there is a huge emotional price greater than the money in having to surrender the composition of one of your own songs. Richard has endured that loss for many years."" Bitter Sweet Symphony has sold 1,276,209 copies in the UK, according to the Official Charts Company, including 70,593 this year. Protest music dominates songwriting awards Ryan Tedder slams 'ludicrous' copyright cases Ashcroft picked up the outstanding contribution prize at Thursday's Ivor Novello Awards, which recognise achievement in songwriting. Other winners included Deep Purple, Dido and Mariah Carey, who won the special international award. ""I rarely get acknowledged for my songwriting, which is the core of who I am,"" said the diva in a video message - due to the fact she's performing at an AIDS gala in Cannes on Thursday evening. ""It's a beautiful thing to feel appreciated for the music I've been making for my entire career."" Mariah Carey has had 18 number one singles in the US Carey has written or co-written 17 US number one singles, including Vision of Love, Hero, We Belong Together and Fantasy (her 18th number one, I'll Be There, is a cover of a Jackson 5 song). Her festive hit All I Want For Christmas Is You has become a modern-day standard, and was streamed a staggering 38 million times in the UK last year alone. Grime pioneer Wiley received the ""inspiration"" prize and instantly handed it over to his father, the reggae musician Richard Cowie. ""It's because of him that I do it,"" said the star. ""I want to big up my dad."" Socially-conscious punk band Idles won album of the year, while The 1975 took home two prizes - songwriters of the year and best contemporary song for the state-of-the-nation pop anthem Love It If We Made It. Organisers hailed the ""brilliantly diverse"" range of songwriting talent in the UK, noting that 70% of this year's nominees were being recognised for the first time.

Polls close in UK's European elections,"The polls have closed in the UK for the European Parliament elections. Seventy-three members, known as MEPs, will be elected in nine constituencies in England, and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region's number of representatives is based on its population - from three MEPs in north-east England and Northern Ireland to 10 in south-east England. The results will be announced once all EU nations have voted, expected to be completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday. How the BBC reports polling day European elections: What you need to know EU citizens in UK turned away from polls The Netherlands also voted on Thursday while voting in other EU nations will take place at various times over the next three days. Voters had to be registered to vote, be 18 years old or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country. They had to be resident at a UK address (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not be legally excluded from voting. MEPs are elected in the order listed by their party, based on the total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, and each voter can choose one party or individual to back. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used, allowing voters to rank the parties standing in order of preference. 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do MEPs get elected?

Modi thanks India for 'historic mandate',"This video can not be played Modi supporters celebrate after a vote which had been widely viewed as a referendum on the prime minister Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thanked the people of India for giving him a ""historic mandate"" of five more years in office, after a landslide victory in the general election. ""We all want a new India. I want to bow down my head and say thank you,"" he said in a victory address to supporters of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP is projected to get about 300 of the 543 seats in parliament. It is likely to take a larger share of the vote than in the 2014 elections. The main opposition alliance, which is headed by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, has admitted defeat. What is Modi's record in office? Modi reinvents Indian politics The Hindu foot soldier who became PM India's election - as it happened The general election was widely viewed as a referendum on the prime minister's Hindu nationalist politics, and the victory was won despite growing unemployment, fears of a recession and a slump in industrial production. Partial and declared results show Mr Modi's BJP is projected to win 300 seats on its own, and combined with the party's allies, this number reaches nearly 350. The main opposition Congress party is expected to win fewer than 60. A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. The results as they come in A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election In 2014, the BJP won 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years - and with its allies it secured 336 seats in that parliament. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat in 2014 and with its allies took up just 60 seats in the lower house. More than 600 million people voted in a marathon six-week process, which involved seven rounds of voting. The 68-year-old prime minister was showered with rose petals by thousands of supporters as he arrived at the BJP headquarters on Thursday evening. ""This election was fought not by politicians but the people of this country - but it's the people of this country who have emerged victorious,"" Mr Modi told supporters in Delhi. Modi: The man who wants 900m votes ""We will never give up our ideals, our humility and our culture,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said the victory was for the whole of the country, and vowed to build a ""strong and inclusive India"". Party members cheered, banged drums and set off fireworks when the results started to emerge. Narendra Modi made this an election all about himself. He should have faced some anti-incumbent feeling. Joblessness has risen to a record high, farm incomes have plummeted and industrial production has slumped. Many Indians were hit hard by the currency ban (also known as demonetisation), which was designed to flush out undeclared wealth, and there were complaints about what critics said was a poorly designed and complicated uniform sales tax. The results prove that people are not yet blaming Mr Modi for this. A combination of nationalist rhetoric, subtle religious polarisation and a slew of welfare programmes helped Mr Modi to coast to a second successive win. He also mined national security as a vote-getter in a manner never seen in a general election in recent history. ""It is all right if there's little development, but Modi is keeping the nation secure and keeping India's head high,"" a voter in the eastern city of Kolkata told me. Mr Modi is a strongman, and people possibly love him for that. Modi reinvents Indian politics At a press conference in Delhi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conceded the general election as well as his Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh, which he had held since 2004 and his family had held for decades. But he will still be in parliament as he contested and won another seat - Wayanad in Kerala. Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka failed to improve on a dismal Congress performance last time The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Delhi says Congress Party staff, who had been hoping for a much improved performance, looked lost for words. Messages of congratulation have been sent from a number of world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and China's President Xi Jinping.

The BJP alliance has been projected to win more than 50% of the vote in the huge northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends more MPs to parliament than any other state (80). This took election observers by surprise as the party was expected to be seriously challenged by a tie-up between two powerful regional parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), which had previously been bitter rivals. Echoes of Trump in Modi's border politics PM Narendra Modi's Tamil Nadu problem How sugar influences the world's biggest vote The BJP is doing better than expected in West Bengal, where it is projected to take 17 parliamentary seats - up from two in the last polls. Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP and appear to have done so again in this election. They look set to take just three of the 91 seats up for grabs. In his victory speech, Mr Modi said there were only two castes in India now. ""The poor and those who want to work to bring them out of poverty. We need to empower both."" Growing unemployment and fears of a recession will see Mr Modi face demands to provide jobs for the millions of young people entering the labour market in coming months. Under his first term, India's economy - the world's sixth largest - lost some of its momentum. A leaked government report this year put the unemployment rate at the highest it's been since the 1970s. Farmers in India will also be hoping he will prioritise the agricultural industry, after a crop glut and declining commodity prices saw their incomes stagnate. India has seen huge protests by farmers in recent years Many saw this election as a battle for India's identity and the protection of minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynching of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. And national security was put into the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting it to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of conflict.

Theresa May resists clamour to resign,"The prime minister is resisting calls to resign despite a growing backlash against her Brexit plan from Conservative MPs. Several cabinet ministers told the BBC that she cannot stay, with one saying it is ""the end of the line"". Tory backbenchers met on Wednesday evening, but decided not to change rules which would have allowed an immediate vote of no confidence in her. The BBC's political editor says the PM seems to have bought herself 36 hours. Mrs May will meet the chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. In the meantime, the UK will vote on Thursday in European Parliament elections, with the Conservatives widely predicted to do very badly. Allow Twitter content?

Discontent at Mrs May's leadership grew significantly after she set out plans for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU on the terms of Brexit. It included a number of concessions designed to attract cross-party support, including new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Latest: Reaction to PM's Brexit ""compromise"" offer No 10 plans to stand firm as PM's future unclear But Brexiteers in her own party reacted angrily to it, particularly a promise to give MPs a vote on another referendum if they backed the bill. Mrs May insists it is Parliament's ""last chance"" to get Brexit done. Several cabinet ministers broke cover on Wednesday afternoon to signal their unhappiness with the bill, among them Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also requested a private meeting with the PM. But Laura Kuenssberg said the PM declined to meet the ministers - both of whom are seen as possible contenders to be the next Conservative leader - and instead seemed determined to ""tough it out"". Sources told the BBC the chief whip, Julian Smith, made it clear to backbench MPs that the prime minister was not resigning. The 1922 Committee had been expected to vote on Wednesday evening on whether to change the party's rules to allow an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Current rules dictate that as the PM survived such a vote in December, she cannot face another one for 12 months. However, the vote on a rule change did not take place - and afterwards, some members expressed their discontent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The PM has already pledged to set a timetable for a new leader to take over after MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - in theory, on 7 June. But calls for her to go sooner than that have begun to come from Conservatives who had, until now, stayed loyal. PM under fire over new Brexit plan Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? Writing in the Financial Times,external, Tom Tugendhat said: ""Leadership matters; it has been absent for too long,"" he said. ""This can only change with a new prime minister."" Former minister Tim Loughton said it was ""very sad"", but it was time for her to go - another, Stephen Crabb, said there needs to be a new PM ""within weeks"". More familiar critics also added to the clamour for her resignation. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""not personal"" but about ""the future of the country"", and his party ""needs to reassemble a governing coalition willing to take us out of the EU"", under a new leader. There have been doubts about Theresa May's leadership for many months. She herself has more or less said she will resign next month. But something different has happened today, the mood has really changed. More and more Conservatives publicly are saying she has to quit as soon as possible. Ministers have been saying to me privately she has now reached the end of line. Number 10 is adamant, though, that nothing has really changed she will press on and still try and get her Brexit deal though. But it feels the government is almost in breakdown. And it's simply not clear at this moment they'll really be able to hang on. The UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, but that has been pushed back to 31 October after the Commons rejected Mrs May's withdrawal deal with Brussels three times. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise via formal talks broke down last week, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rejected Mrs May's attempts to win his MPs over with her Brexit withdrawal bill plan. Mr Corbyn said her ""bold new deal"" was really a ""repackaged version"" of her failed withdrawal agreement, adding: ""No Labour MP can vote for a deal with the promise of a prime minister who only has days left in her job."" He said the issue of Brexit had been ""dividing our society and poisoning our democracy"", but claimed Mrs May's deal ""does not represent a genuine compromise"". Addressing her critics in the Commons earlier, Mrs May said: ""In time, another prime minister will be standing at this despatch box, but while I am here, I have a duty to be clear with the House about the facts. ""If we are going to deliver Brexit in this Parliament, we have to pass a Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and we will not do so without holding votes on the issues that have divided us the most,"" she said. ""In the end, our job in the House is to take decisions, not duck them."" The SNP's leader in Westminster Ian Blackford - who supports a further referendum to remain in the EU - said it was time for the prime minister to go, having ""lost the trust of the public"". ""This deal is dead,"" he added. The DUP, which props up Mrs May's government, has also refused the vote for the bill. Labour's Liz Kendall backed the call for a public vote, telling Mrs May she will not get enough support for her bill from opposition members without including a confirmatory ballot as part of the deal - rather than just offering a vote on whether to have one. But Conservative MP Vicky Ford said: ""We cannot continue to leave our country in this uncertainty. It has to stop. The whole House has to stop saying no to everything on the table just because it is not our favourite dish. ""If we vote for this bill we can move on and the discussion on the next stage can start."" This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Mrs May is bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring her agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In an attempt to win over MPs across the House, she announced the following concessions: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporary customs union for goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replace the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good, if not better"" after Brexit - and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes to the political declaration on future relations with the EU Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

'Star-maker' unmasked,"Bob Higgins was youth development officer at Southampton until 1989 Such was the influence of Bob Higgins as a youth coach at Southampton, he was known as the ""star-maker"". He was seen as instrumental in the development of several players who would go on to become household names; during his time at Southampton, players of the calibre of future England stars Alan Shearer and Matt Le Tissier broke into the football club's first team. But Bob Higgins was also a ruthless, predatory paedophile, who used his position of power to groom and then abuse boys whose dreams of a playing career he could make or break. Nearly 30 years after he was first accused - and cleared - of sexual abuse, the crimes of 66-year-old Higgins have finally caught up with him, with his conviction at Bournemouth Crown Court of 45 counts of indecent assault. His unmasking as a serial sex offender was the consequence ofscores of former players coming forward in 2016, when the extent of historical abuse in the game began to become clear. When, at the time of the scandal, the NSPCC set up a dedicated phone line to offer support to victims, 87 people called the charity and a further 32 contacted police directly with allegations of abuse relating to Southampton. One name - and only one name - was mentioned time and again in connection with abuse at Southampton: Bob Higgins. Higgins abused youth players in his care over several decades The eight-week retrial - held after a previous jury at Winchester Crown Court could not reach verdicts on 48 counts of indecent assault - was told Higgins kept an open house at his homes in Camberley, Surrey, and later Southampton. He would let boys stay there while they attended training sessions at weekends or during school holidays. This allowed him to groom his victims. He would give players lifts to and from training, playing songs by Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie in an effort to create a romantic mood. Sitting on the sofa at his home, he would demand cuddles from the boys and go on to touch them inappropriately. He would also use the pretext of treating injuries or performing soap-water massages to abuse youngsters at the club. There is no suggestion that any of the club's biggest names who were coached by Higgins - including the likes of Danny Wallace and Steve Williams, as well as Shearer and Le Tissier - were abused by him. But many of those youth players who were sexually assaulted were left so distressed that they gave up football entirely. This video can not be played Billy Seymour, a charity ambassador campaigning against abuse in football, waived his right to anonymity Billy Seymour, a trainee at Southampton from 1983 until 1986, was one of them. He died before he could see his abuser face justice - although Higgins was found guilty of a single count of indecent assault at the earlier trial in 2018. The 47-year-old died in a crash in Oxfordshire in January, shortly before the retrial was due to begin. In an unusual step, audio of his appearance in the witness box from the first trial was played to the jury in the retrial, as well as a video of his police interview. Mr Seymour said his life ""unravelled"" after the abuse; he struggled with anger issues and served time in prison. The court heard how he ""nearly killed"" a taxi driver he had threatened to attack with a plasterer's knife, as he reminded him of Higgins. Shortly before being sentenced, he told his mother that his victim ""looked like Bob, smelt like Bob"", adding: ""He's inside me."" England internationals Alan Shearer and Matt Le Tissier were coached by Higgins Rumours about Higgins's activities had circulated for years. Nonetheless, the court heard how the coach was trusted by parents and idolised by youngsters, providing him with the cover he needed. There was an implicit trade-off: boys knew they needed to keep quiet or risk losing their shot at a career as a footballer. Many said nothing, even to close family members, for up to 30 years. Higgins left Southampton in 1989 after being confronted by a colleague who had overheard youth players sharing stories about him. He went on trial in the early 1990s but was acquitted. This allowed him to remain in football for many more years - and to continue offending. It was only in 2016, when victims of child abuse in football aired their experiences on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, that a stream of complainants, including Mr Seymour, came forward. The police reopened their investigation and began to build a new case against Higgins. This video can not be played Matt Le Tissier said he was given a ""very, very wrong"" massage by Higgins Described in court as a ""rubbish"" player, he had nevertheless been a respected scout and youth coach. Higgins joined Southampton in the early 1970s and over the next two decades played a key role in bringing through some of the club's best players. In the 1980s, Wallace and Williams, both acknowledged as his discoveries, were part of one of Southampton's most successful teams. Higgins also helped develop the skills of Shearer and Le Tissier. When the football abuse scandal broke in 2016, Shearer said he had ""huge respect and admiration"" for former team-mates who had come forward. ""Whilst I am lucky and have no personal experience of the terrible stories that have been described, I know from my work as an NSPCC ambassador the pain and lasting damage abuse can cause."" Le Tissier told the BBC in 2016 he had been given a ""naked massage"" by Higgins. In the interview, Le Tissier said he was not abused but the incident was ""very, very wrong"". This video can not be played Les Cleevely was abused while watching Match of the Day at Higgins's home Les Cleevely, who went on to become a successful goalkeeping coach, recalled how, as a 12-year-old schoolboy scouted by Higgins, he was ""mesmerised"" by the ""young, trendy and charismatic"" coach. Like many others, he was invited to stay at Higgins's house. He described his night there as a ""horror story"". ""The whole thing [the abuse] went on in pitch black while we were watching Match of the Day,"" he said. ""So for the entire length of Match of the Day it was horrendous. ""And then the rest of the night spent at the house was with your eyes wide open wondering what was going to happen next. ""He had power over our careers. It was everything we wanted in life as kids he held the key to. Some people thought, 'is it going to put my situation in jeopardy?'"" This video can not be played Jamie Webb eventually tore up his contract with Southampton Jamie Webb still recalls the ""magical moment"" he joined the club and met Higgins at Southampton's then home, The Dell. ""I was really in awe. I couldn't believe, walking down the old Dell steps,"" he said. But Mr Webb says his memories of his time at the club are tainted by the abuse he was subjected to by Higgins while he stayed at his house. ""We were all vying for affection in a way and the banter would be more like, 'Oh Bob loves you and you're one of Bob's favourites',"" he said. ""It was almost what you wanted to hear. I'd get given kit. Sometimes I'd buy some kit and I'd get an extra top thrown in and shorts."" At the time he was pleased with the attention, but now he sees the behaviour for what it was. ""For me, it's just grooming."" Boys would be invited to stay with Higgins and his wife Shirley during weekend and school holiday training camps Jurors were told Higgins would play pop songs on the car stereo as he touched boys inappropriately while driving to and from training sessions. Mr Seymour recalled Whitney Houston's Greatest Love of All playing and Higgins telling him: ""It reminds me of you."" ""Whenever it comes on, it takes me back,"" he told the court last year. ""Looking back, I tried to normalise it, but it wasn't normal to be in that situation."" Such was his emotional hold over them that many boys wrote Higgins letters, expressing love and gratitude, calling him a ""second father"" or a ""brother"". One victim said it made him physically sick when he was recently shown a letter he had written to Higgins. ""I was only 13 and I was just a kid and I didn't know any different,"" he said. ""Bob would put you under a lot of pressure to write those letters. ""He'd basically show you letters of famous players. You wanted to be that player and I wanted my career, and whatever it took, I'd do that."" Lawrie McMenemy said Higgins would have been ""out of the door"" if the club's management had known about his abuse Lawrie McMenemy, Southampton's manager between 1973 and 1985, said he had not been in any way aware of Higgins's offending during his time in charge of the club. ""I didn't know he was taking kids home,"" he said. ""None of my staff knew that. ""It's horrific what he's done. If we'd have known, he wouldn't have lasted two minutes. He'd have been out the door."" Rumours about Higgins's activities were certainly circulating by the late 1980s, though. Dave Merrington, who was youth team manager and would later manage the first team, recalled being ""troubled and disturbed"" when he heard banter among players in a minibus. Dave Merrington said he challenged Higgins, who threatened to sue anyone who made claims about him ""I realised they were talking about Bob,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the comments were of a sexual nature that I wasn't happy about."" He raised the matter at a staff meeting and was told it would be brought to the attention of the board. Later, he was told he should be the one to raise the issue with Higgins, which he did at a meeting in the players' lounge at The Dell. ""He jumped up, got extremely annoyed and said: 'I'll sue anyone who says anything about me,'"" Mr Merrington said. ""I tried to cool him down but he got extremely annoyed. He stormed out. Within a week or a fortnight he had resigned, as I understand it, and left the club."" A police investigation followed and Higgins was accused of abusing six boys, but he was acquitted of one charge in 1991 and the other charges were discontinued. Mr Merrington had given evidence along with complainant Dean Radford, who was 18 when he came forward in 1989. Dean Radford signed with Southampton as a schoolboy ""For a boy to open up at that particular stage of his career - he was a very, very brave young man,"" Mr Merrington said. ""No-one from the club spoke to us about [the court case]. That disappoints and hurts me. ""I felt the system let him down very badly."" Guy Askham, who was Southampton chairman at the time, said the club's board had been part-timers who tried their best to deal with the issue. ""We believed the board had taken the right decision in reporting the allegations to the police,"" he said. This video can not be played Former Southampton player Dean Radford talking in 2016 about the abuse he suffered Mr Radford recalled being ""scared to death"" giving evidence and being cross-examined. ""I was just told on the telephone he'd been found not guilty,"" he said. ""They let it go. That was it, he was a free man."" Following Higgins's acquittal, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction on the remaining charges. Higgins gave an interview to the Southampton Daily Echo newspaper, headlined: ""My two years of hell"", and continued working in football, taking up a coaching job with the Malta Football Association. He stayed there until 1994 when he began working with youth players at Peterborough United. The court heard how Higgins, who had recently claimed to have become a Christian, baptised boys in his bath at home. Two charges in the retrial related to cases at Peterborough. One witness told the trial he was assaulted 10 to 20 times in Higgins's home. Hampshire and Southampton social services warned parents about Higgins in 1997 Allegations against Higgins were aired again in January 1997 in a Channel 4 documentary. After the Dispatches programme, both Hampshire and Southampton social services consulted police and wrote to local youth organisations expressing concern about him coaching boys. A joint letter from the departments, unearthed by the BBC through a Freedom of Information request, urged parents to ""make an informed choice about his contact with your child/ren"". Dr John Beer, the head of Southampton Social Services at the time, said he received several replies from parents criticising him for impugning Higgins's good character. ""That is the standard way that we learn that paedophiles operated,"" he said. ""The safest way for them is to groom parents and figures who have status in the community, so if the young person made any allegations they were likely to be disbelieved."" What next for football's abuse investigations? '80 coaches convicted of child sex abuse' Justice has been served - Bennell victims Higgins continued in the game in Hampshire, with coaching roles at Bashley, Winchester City and Fleet Town, until the football abuse scandal broke in 2016 and his career in football was finally brought to an end. Det Ch Insp David Brown, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme had been the ""catalyst"" that prompted many more victims to come forward. But with allegations dating back decades, there was no forensic evidence or any paperwork that could provide a ""smoking gun"" to convict Higgins. This video can not be played Bob Higgins ""did not speak a single word"" during 15 hours of interviews, police said Moreover, the media coverage, which encouraged more victims to come forward, proved a doubled-edged sword for the investigation team. It meant they had to interview all of the complainants quickly to ensure they did not communicate with one other ahead of a trial and potentially jeopardise the criminal case. Their testimony confirmed a pattern of predatory behaviour from Higgins. ""We had a large number of people and it was repeated similar factual evidence - the same songs played in the car, the same activities, the same bedtime routines - that helped build a compelling case,"" Det Ch Insp Brown said. Young players would train in the gym at The Dell Detectives were unable to trace all the paperwork from the legal proceedings in the 1990s. However, they found trial documents from an unlikely source - Higgins himself. When they searched Higgins's house they discovered detailed accounts of the trial, statements boys had made to police, as well as memorabilia, letters and photos from the 1980s. ""Much of the material he retained was used as evidence of controlling, coercive behaviour,"" Det Insp Brown said. Several victims and witnesses at the recent trial explained how they had not felt able to talk of the abuse when interviewed by police in the early 1990s. ""I was not ready - mentally, physically or emotionally - to divulge the horrific things that had happened to me,"" Mr Seymour told the court. ""I knew something was seriously, seriously wrong. I was just not ready to deal with it at that precise moment."" Higgins's wife Shirley stood by him in court. She claimed Mr Merrington had a ""vendetta"" against her husband and boys had been cajoled into making allegations against him. She said she had acted as a ""second mother"" to the youngsters staying at their house. When asked if she had ever seen her husband act inappropriately with any boys, Mrs Higgins replied: ""No. Never. I wouldn't be married to him for 45 years if he had."" Mrs Higgins said it was she who had kept cards and photos from young footballers, which she said gave her ""happy memories"". Higgins covered his face while entering and leaving court throughout the retrial at Bournemouth Crown Court However, after more than a week of deliberation, the jury found Higgins guilty of dozens of offences. For his victims, it meant a long wait for justice was over. Police believe more abuse survivors could come forward following his conviction. Double jeopardy rules meant Mr Radford, whom Higgins was cleared of abusing nearly 30 years ago, was unable to be a complainant in the recent trials. However, he did give evidence as a witness. ""I'd like him to sit behind bars and know that he's there partly because of me,"" he said. Victims have spoken about how they remain haunted by the abuse. Many are also left wondering about what might have been. Mr Webb eventually tore up his contract with Southampton. Now in his 40s, he cannot know how far he could have gone in football. ""A lot of people said I was good and everything, but it's hard looking back on that period. ""I just used to say to people that I wasn't mentally focused. I'll never know what might have been.""

Brexit: PM's withdrawal bill delayed,"Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal bill will not be published or debated until early June, the government says. The prime minister is under pressure to resign following a backlash from her own MPs against her pledged ""new deal"" on Brexit. Andrea Leadsom quit as Commons Leader, saying she could not announce the bill which had ""new elements that I fundamentally oppose"". She has been replaced by Treasury minister Mel Stride. Downing Street has confirmed that the prime minister met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid at No 10 on Thursday morning and would ""give full consideration their views"" about the bill. Mrs May hadtold the Commons,externalthat the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU - would be published on Friday so MPs would have ""the maximum possible time to study its detail"". This video can not be played Government delays Brexit bill publication Mrs Leadsom had been due to announce when it would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday, but resigned on Wednesday night. Standing in for her, government whip Mark Spencer told MPs: ""We will update the House on the publication and introduction of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on our return from the Whitsun recess."" He added that the government planned to publish the bill in the first week of June. ""We had hoped to hold second reading on Friday 7 June,"" he added. ""At the moment, we have not secured agreement to this in the usual channels. Of course we will update the House when we return from recess."" Second reading is when MPs get a first chance to debate legislation, before deciding whether it should proceed to detailed scrutiny. Responding for Labour, shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said: ""The prime minister has once again put her own political survival ahead of the national interest. ""It is clear that the prime minister does not command a majority in her approach to Brexit and she has failed to accept this political reality."" US President Donald Trump is due to make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Asked who would be in 10 Downing Street when he arrives, Mr Hunt said: ""Theresa May will be prime minister to welcome him and rightly so."" It is possible for Mrs May to quit as Conservative leader before Mr Trump's visit, but continue as prime minister on a caretaker basis. Mrs Leadsom said on Thursday she had ""no doubts that I made the right decision"" adding: ""I felt I couldn't, in all conscience, stand up and deliver the business statement today with a Withdrawal Agreement Bill in it that I couldn't support elements of."" She did not answer questions about whether she was planning to run for the leadership. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. In a mini-reshuffle prompted by Mrs Leadsom's resignation, Mel Stride, who had been Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has replaced her as Commons leader. He has been replaced on the Treasury team by Jesse Norman, whose previous role as a transport minister has been filled by Michael Ellis. Rebecca Pow has been made a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, replacing Mr Ellis. On Wednesday, members of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 Committee held a secret ballot on whether to change party rules, to allow the prime minister to face a vote of no confidence immediately. Mrs May is due to meet the chairman of the committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. The results, in sealed envelopes, will be opened if Mrs May does not agree to stand down by 10 June. Mrs May survived ano-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in December.Under existing rules, she cannot be challenged again until December this year.

China warns UK against Huawei 5G ban,"A top Chinese diplomat has warned that there could be ""substantial"" repercussions for her country's investment in the UK, if Huawei were to be banned from Britain's 5G network. Chen Wen also told the BBC that Beijing had already ""witnessed some conscious moves"" in that direction. Last week, the US put Huawei on a list that curbs the ability of US firms to trade with it. US officials blamed national security concerns over Huawei technology. The UK is still reviewing its 5G telecoms policy and may allow Huawei to supply ""non-core"" 5G components, such as antenna masts. Huawei is considered a world-leading provider of next-generation 5G technology, which will provide superfast mobile internet connections. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Chen, who is the Chinese chargÃ© d'affaires in London, said the UK economy would be damaged by the message any ban on Huawei sent out to international and Chinese companies. ""The message is not going to be very positive,"" she said. ""Is UK still open? Is UK still extending a welcoming arm to other Chinese investors?"" When asked how large the repercussions would be, the embassy official said: ""It's hard to predict at the moment, but I think it's going to be quite substantial."" Ms Chen insisted that her government would never force a Chinese firm operating abroad to provide information to its intelligence agencies. She went on to claim that there was a bit of ""hysteria"" in the United States about the rise of Chinese influence and the UK should make decisions based on its own national interest. She called Huawei's investment in the UK ""a vote of confidence in the UK economy"". Earlier this week, Cambridge-based chip designer ARM told its staff they must halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagementsâ with Huawei to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. On the same day, EE confirmed that its range of 5G phones would not include Huawei models. It followed a decision from Google to bar the smartphone maker from some updates to the Android operating system.

Hospital abuse missed despite 100 official visits,"This video can not be played Undercover BBC filming shows staff swearing, mocking and taunting patients with autism and learning disabilities Whorlton Hall hospital had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before abuse of inpatients there was discovered, the BBC has learned. Inspectors, council officials and NHS staff all visited the County Durham unit - sometimes in teams of two or three over the course of several days. But the scale of mistreatment of people there with learning disabilities and autism was not spotted. Campaigners said the authorities had failed in their jobs. Undercover filming by the BBC's Panorama programme- aired on Wednesday - showed patients at the 17-bed unit being mocked, taunted, intimidated and repeatedly restrained. The footage also included shocking scenes where some staff can be heard using offensive language to describe patients, while another calls the hospital a ""house of mongs"". A police investigation has been launched and 16 staff suspended. How we uncovered abuse at specialist hospital Hospital 'abused' vulnerable adults The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates the sector, went in three times - in March, April and July of last year. One of the visits lasted two days and involved a team of three after concerns were raised by a whistle-blower. The inspection found breaches of regulations in relation to staffing and good governance, but the hospital kept its good rating. CQC deputy chief inspector Dr Paul Lelliott said it was ""now clear we missed what was going on"". He said the regulator was sorry. He said inspectors spoke to staff and patients as well as independent people familiar with the hospital. But no concerns were raised. ""This illustrates how difficult it is to get under the skin of this type of 'closed culture',"" he added. In one case, a patient at Whorlton Hall was told by her care worker that her family are ""poison"" On top of the CQC visit, there were multiple visits by 10 different councils and local NHS bodies. Durham Council visited the hospital 33 times over the past year - 12 because of safeguarding concerns - with the rest largely related to the placement of new patients at the 17-bed unit. The council's corporate director of adult and health service, Jane Robinson, said: ""We found no evidence suggesting issues of the nature shown in the programme."" Richard Kramer, chief executive of disability charity Sense, criticised the approach taken by authorities. He said agencies were maybe too likely to take the word of staff at ""face value"", rather than insist on observations and on seeing the person. ""This appears to be a case of professionals not investing time and resources to fully review the care and support,"" he added. This video can not be played Caroline Dinenage MP calls treatment of vulnerable patients in NHS-funded hospital ""appalling"". Earlier on Thursday, Care Minister Caroline Dinenage told the House of Commons she was ""deeply sorry that this has happened"". Ms Dinenage said that after the government and the Care Quality Commission were told of the allegations of abuse at Whorlton Hall, ""immediate steps"" were taken to ensure the safety of the patients there. And she questions needed to be asked over whether the activity at Whorlton Hall was criminal, if the regulatory and inspection framework is working and also over the commissioning of care services.

The council's corporate director of adult and health service, Jane Robinson, said: ""We found no evidence suggesting issues of the nature shown in the programme."" Richard Kramer, chief executive of disability charity Sense, criticised the approach taken by authorities. He said agencies were maybe too likely to take the word of staff at ""face value"", rather than insist on observations and on seeing the person. ""This appears to be a case of professionals not investing time and resources to fully review the care and support,"" he added.

Earlier on Thursday, Care Minister Caroline Dinenage told the House of Commons she was ""deeply sorry that this has happened"". Ms Dinenage said that after the government and the Care Quality Commission were told of the allegations of abuse at Whorlton Hall, ""immediate steps"" were taken to ensure the safety of the patients there. And she questions needed to be asked over whether the activity at Whorlton Hall was criminal, if the regulatory and inspection framework is working and also over the commissioning of care services.

European election voting continues across UK,"The polls have closed in the UK for the European Parliament elections. Seventy-three members, known as MEPs, will be elected in nine constituencies in England, and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region's number of representatives is based on its population - from three MEPs in north-east England and Northern Ireland to 10 in south-east England. The results will be announced once all EU nations have voted, expected to be completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday. How the BBC reports polling day European elections: What you need to know EU citizens in UK turned away from polls The Netherlands also voted on Thursday while voting in other EU nations will take place at various times over the next three days. Voters had to be registered to vote, be 18 years old or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country. They had to be resident at a UK address (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not be legally excluded from voting. MEPs are elected in the order listed by their party, based on the total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, and each voter can choose one party or individual to back. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used, allowing voters to rank the parties standing in order of preference. 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do MEPs get elected?

Landslide win for Narendra Modi in India elections,"This video can not be played BJP supporters celebrate as their party looks set to win a clear majority in parliament Indian PM Narendra Modi has secured another five-year term after winning a landslide general election victory. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to win about 300 of the 543 seats in parliament, in what Mr Modi hailed as ""a historic mandate"". The main opposition alliance, which is headed by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, has admitted defeat. The vote had been widely viewed as a referendum on the prime minister's Hindu nationalist politics. ""We all want a new India. I want to bow down my head and say thank you,"" Mr Modi said in a victory address to BJP supporters on Thursday evening. What is Modi's record in office? Modi reinvents Indian politics The Hindu foot soldier who became PM India election - as it happened More than 600 million people voted in a marathon six-week process. Mr Modi has not just exceeded exit poll predictions but has also won a larger share of the vote than the 2014 elections, partial results show. Many viewed the election as a referendum on Mr Modi (L) who won a landslide in 2014 At a press conference in Delhi, Mr Gandhi conceded the general election as well as his Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh, which he had held since 2004 and his family had held for decades. Partial and declared results show Mr Modi's BJP is projected to win 300 seats on its own, and combined with the party's allies, this number reaches nearly 350. The main opposition Congress party is expected to win fewer than 60. A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. Live results,external A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election Modi: The man who wants 900m votes 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls In 2014, the BJP won 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years - and with its allies it secured 336 seats in that parliament. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat in 2014 and with its allies took up just 60 seats in the lower house. This video can not be played If you havenât been paying much attention, hereâs what you've missed This year 900 million voters were eligible to take part in seven rounds of voting, making it the largest election the world has ever seen. The final result may not be known for several hours or longer. Narendra Modi made this an election all about himself. He should have faced some anti-incumbent feeling. Joblessness has risen to a record high, farm incomes have plummeted and industrial production has slumped. Many Indians were hit hard by the currency ban (also known as demonetisation), which was designed to flush out undeclared wealth, and there were complaints about what critics said was a poorly designed and complicated uniform sales tax. The results prove that people are not yet blaming Mr Modi for this. A combination of nationalist rhetoric, subtle religious polarisation and a slew of welfare programmes helped Mr Modi to coast to a second successive win. He also mined national security as a vote-getter in a manner never seen in a general election in recent history. ""It is all right if there's little development, but Modi is keeping the nation secure and keeping India's head high,"" a voter in the eastern city of Kolkata told me. Mr Modi is a strongman, and people possibly love him for that. Modi reinvents Indian politics ""This election was fought not by politicians but the people of this country - but it's the people of this country who have emerged victorious,"" Mr Modi told thousands of supporters at the BJP's headquarters in Delhi. ""We will never give up our ideals, our humility and our culture,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Party members cheered, banged drums and set off fireworks when the results started to emerge. As the prime minister arrived, he was showered with rose petals. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, a senior BJP leader, said in a tweet thatthe BJP had won a ""massive victory"",external. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulated Mr Modi for his victory on Twitter,external, and said he looked forward to working with him for ""peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia"". The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Delhi says Congress Party staff, who had been hoping for a much improved performance, looked lost for words. Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka had been hoping to improve on a dismal Congress performance last time The BJP alliance is projected to win more than 50% of the vote in the huge northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends more MPs to parliament than any other state (80). This took election observers by surprise as the party was expected to be seriously challenged by a tie-up between two powerful regional parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), which had previously been bitter rivals. Echoes of Trump in Modi's border politics PM Narendra Modi's Tamil Nadu problem How sugar influences the world's biggest vote The BJP is doing better than expected in West Bengal, where it is projected to take 17 parliamentary seats - up from two in the last polls. Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP and appear to have done so again in this election. They look set to take just three of the 91 seats up for grabs. In this part of the country, the party contests few seats, relying instead on alliances with regional heavyweights. In his victory speech, Mr Modi said there were only two castes in India now. ""The poor and those who want to work to bring them out of poverty. We need to empower both."" Growing unemployment and fears of a recession will see Mr Modi face demands to provide jobs for the millions of young people entering the labour market in coming months. Under his first term, India's economy - the world's sixth largest - lost some of its momentum. A leaked government report this year put the unemployment rate at the highest it's been since the 1970s. Farmers in India will also be hoping he will prioritise the agricultural industry, after a crop glut and declining commodity prices saw their incomes stagnate. India has seen huge protests by farmers in recent years Many saw this election as a battle for India's identity and the protection of minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynching of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. And national security was put into the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting it to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of war.

The Stones agreed to license a five-note segment in exchange for 50 percent of the royalties, but Klein claimed the Verve voided the agreement by using a larger portion of the song. ABKCO Records, Klein's holding company, filed a plagiarism case, after which The Verve relinquished all their royalties and publishing rights to ABKCO, and the song credit reverted to Jagger and Richards. The situation rankled The Verve for years. ""We were told it was going to be a 50/50 split,"" recalled bassist Simon Jones.

Care home abuse missed despite 100 visits,"This video can not be played Undercover BBC filming shows staff swearing, mocking and taunting patients with autism and learning disabilities Whorlton Hall hospital had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before abuse of inpatients there was discovered, the BBC has learned. Inspectors, council officials and NHS staff all visited the County Durham unit - sometimes in teams of two or three over the course of several days. But the scale of mistreatment of people there with learning disabilities and autism was not spotted. Campaigners said the authorities had failed in their jobs. Undercover filming by the BBC's Panorama programme- aired on Wednesday - showed patients at the 17-bed unit being mocked, taunted, intimidated and repeatedly restrained. The footage also included shocking scenes where some staff can be heard using offensive language to describe patients, while another calls the hospital a ""house of mongs"". A police investigation has been launched and 16 staff suspended. How we uncovered abuse at specialist hospital Hospital 'abused' vulnerable adults The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates the sector, went in three times - in March, April and July of last year. One of the visits lasted two days and involved a team of three after concerns were raised by a whistle-blower. The inspection found breaches of regulations in relation to staffing and good governance, but the hospital kept its good rating. CQC deputy chief inspector Dr Paul Lelliott said it was ""now clear we missed what was going on"". He said the regulator was sorry. He said inspectors spoke to staff and patients as well as independent people familiar with the hospital. But no concerns were raised. ""This illustrates how difficult it is to get under the skin of this type of 'closed culture',"" he added. In one case, a patient at Whorlton Hall was told by her care worker that her family are ""poison"" On top of the CQC visit, there were multiple visits by 10 different councils and local NHS bodies. Durham Council visited the hospital 33 times over the past year - 12 because of safeguarding concerns - with the rest largely related to the placement of new patients at the 17-bed unit. The council's corporate director of adult and health service, Jane Robinson, said: ""We found no evidence suggesting issues of the nature shown in the programme."" Richard Kramer, chief executive of disability charity Sense, criticised the approach taken by authorities. He said agencies were maybe too likely to take the word of staff at ""face value"", rather than insist on observations and on seeing the person. ""This appears to be a case of professionals not investing time and resources to fully review the care and support,"" he added.

Earlier on Thursday, Care Minister Caroline Dinenage told the House of Commons she was ""deeply sorry that this has happened"". Ms Dinenage said that after the government and the Care Quality Commission were told of the allegations of abuse at Whorlton Hall, ""immediate steps"" were taken to ensure the safety of the patients there. And she questions needed to be asked over whether the activity at Whorlton Hall was criminal, if the regulatory and inspection framework is working and also over the commissioning of care services.

"Set curfew for online lending, say academics","Late-night online access to credit is leading people to borrow more money than they can afford to repay, according to academics. Newcastle University researchers said a ban on online borrowing - primarily through payday loans - between 11pm and 7am could protect consumers. Money is often borrowed to fund late-night, impulse buying, they said. The option for people to block spending on gambling sites is already available on various apps. Why a timely nudge might help us save money Half of twenty-somethings have no savings The research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), warned that people were being encouraged to borrow more than they could pay back because sites were designed to give a false sense of control. It also found that people's mental health could be affected. ""Urgent reforms are needed to protect consumers from financial and psychological risks,"" said lead researcher Dr James Ash. ""The shift online has increased availability of payday loans to people previously excluded by mainstream lenders. ""But our research shows that digital access to credit only offers quick fixes - it does not address borrowing's root cause."" Researchers interviewed borrowers, analysed websites, and spoke to debt charities. They found that some borrowers welcomed not having to explain themselves or face being judged, or rejected, by a real person when applying for loans online. However, the result was that they were targeted by loan providers with messages about extra credit through mobile devices. The Consumer Finance Association, which represents a number of short-term lenders, said: ""The modern economy, and changing nature of the UK workforce, mean that financial needs are no longer restricted to regular business hours. ""The [researchers] clearly want to ignore the benefits of these loans, but for hundreds of thousands of customers this is an important financial service and something that they can now access when convenient for them.""

The undercover migrant," By Joel GunterBBC Africa Eye It was close to midnight when the young man crawled into the desert. All around him was darkness. A hundred metres away, a handful of Tuareg rebels and people smugglers, who worked together ferrying migrants through this unforgiving stretch of the Sahara, were gathered around three trucks, drumming and dancing and letting off long bursts of gunfire that rattled the night sky. He could just make out the faint light from their phones, and every fifth bullet they fired was a tracer that lit a bright arc towards the stars. The young man, who had given himself the name Azeteng, was somewhere in northern Mali near to the border with Algeria. Behind him lay El-Khalil, a bleak and brutal waystation on the West African migrant route to Europe. Ahead of him, sand stretched for miles in every direction. He was a speck on the dark sea of the Sahara. Slowly, painfully, he pushed his body on, trying to keep as low as possible to the ground. Azeteng was on the run. A few hours earlier, the smugglers who controlled El-Khalil had swiped his glasses from his face, just to mess with him, and refused to give them back. Azeteng was 25 but he was small for his age — 5’ 5” and slightly built, with a shy manner and a way of moving through the world that suggested he was always trying not to be seen. He was powerless to stand up for himself, so he backed away. If the smugglers had stopped then to look closely at his glasses, they might have seen the strangely thick frame, the mini-USB port under one arm, the pin-sized hole in the hinge — and they would surely have killed him. He had seen enough already to be sure. The month was May 2017. The migrant routes through northern Mali were controlled by the Tuareg rebels, who worked with smuggling and trafficking networks connected to departure points across West Africa. Azeteng’s journey began in Ghana. Others came from Guinea, the Gambia, Senegal, Sierra Leone. In recent years, tens of thousands of men, women and children made their way into the Sahara, drawn by the distant promise of a better life in Europe. A Ghanaian migrant who set out in 2016 told me he turned back in fear after hitting the desert. His friends persevered, towards Libya, he said. “Only one succeeded, to Italy. Later he told us that the rest were dead.” Those who attempt the desert crossing travel along ancient trans-Saharan trade routes through Mali and Niger to Algeria and Libya and on to the sea. News reports have focused on the grim toll of the Mediterranean, which claimed the lives of more than 5,000 migrants the year before Azeteng set out. But according to UN estimates, as many as twice the number of migrants died in the desert. A few weeks after Azeteng crawled out of El-Khalil, 44 Ghanaians and Nigerians, including young children, died of thirst in Niger when the smugglers who brought them that far ran out of fuel. Weeks later, at least 50 migrants died when three trucks were abandoned for unknown reasons. Those were the headlines. Many more would die uncounted in the sand. Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Outside El-Khalil, Azeteng prayed. For now, at least, the smugglers seemed too preoccupied with partying to notice the young migrant crawling in the sand, or pay much attention to the strange pair of glasses he had been wearing. When Azeteng thought he was far enough away to be safe, he stood up, brushed the sand from his clothes, and walked into the desert. Azeteng was a middle child but an odd one out. Of his seven siblings, he was the only one with a different mother. He grew up on a rural police barracks in northern Ghana with his father, step-mother, and three half-sisters in two rooms. His own mother lived in central Ghana, and when Azeteng’s father was away, which was often, Azeteng felt like a stranger in his own home. He was supposed to follow his father into the police, but Azeteng dreamed of being a spy. He spent his pocket money on James Bond films and low-budget CIA thrillers, burned on to blank DVDs by traders at the local market. On the weekends, when his father sent him to cut grass for the family’s livestock in a garden behind the police station, Azeteng would pretend he was on a mission, and tiptoe to the door to listen in. What he heard on those weekends killed off what little ambition he had to join the police. He heard poor women come to the office to report that their husbands had beaten them, only to be told they would have to pay for a pen to take their statement, or for petrol to drive to make arrests. The tricks were cheap, and the sums pitifully small, but they had an outsized impact on young Azeteng. When he saw prisoners whipped with sticks in their cells, he knew for sure he would not be a policeman after all. As a teenager, Azeteng carried a pocket radio everywhere. His whirring, detail-driven mind catalogued the world around him, sometimes struggling to discern which details were important and which were not. He wanted to fight against injustice, but he didn’t know how. After high school he went to work with his mother in the fields of Kintampo, and at night he listened to his radio and imagined himself as an undercover journalist. He had already reported one story, at his high school. Using a flip phone to secretly film, he exposed a group of teachers who were brewing alcohol on school grounds    and taking money from students for grades, and when the story made the local papers, three teachers, including the headmaster, were sacked or transferred. Lying in bed in Kintampo, after a day's work in the fields, Azeteng dreamed of telling a bigger story, exposing bigger crimes. On the radio, the news bulletins said young people from Africa were dying in their thousands in the desert and the sea. Six months later, Azeteng boarded a bus to Abeka Lapaz in the west of Accra, where he walked along the side of the nine-lane George W Bush Highway until he reached a nondescript two-storey building, home to CSIT Limited — purveyors of computer products and technical solutions, including secret cameras. He had already done some research into the various types of secret camera available. There was the button, the pen, the clock, the watch, and the glasses. At 200 cedis — about £30 — the glasses were the cheapest. They were capable of recording only low-resolution images and they worked poorly at night. Later, British police would have to examine the footage carefully as they pieced together Azeteng’s story. But as he looked at himself in the mirror that day, Azeteng was just pleased to see it would take a second, third, probably fourth glance to spot that anything was amiss. He bought them, and called them his secret spectacles. For five months, while he saved, Azeteng practised filming and hiding the memory cards in his mouth — a trick from a spy film. Then he sold his livestock — two sheep, six goats and 10 chickens — and set a date to leave. At this point, no-one knew about Azeteng’s wildly dangerous idea except for Azeteng. So he told his priest: he intended to get himself smuggled on the desert migrant route to Europe, using a secret camera in his glasses to document the crimes of the smugglers. The priest asked him if he had considered the dangers involved. Azeteng said he had. “I thought it was a service to the world, a service to restore human dignity,” the priest told me later. “I said I would offer Mass for him while he was away.” Next Azeteng told his father, who now lives in a stone house on a small plot outside Accra. He still has the bearing of a policeman, though slightly faded by retirement, and he still rears livestock, which roamed the plot while we sat inside, away from the fierce afternoon sun. “I was mad, mad because I couldn’t understand why he wants to take that risk,” he said. “Sincerely, I did not give him my blessing. Then he called to say that he had taken off, and I said, well, that is his choice. God be with you.” Azeteng had packed a few items of clothing and made a razor cut in the lining of his rucksack to hide his cash. Then he walked to Kinbu Junction, a teeming transport hub in downtown Accra, and asked three young men if they were going north. They said yes, they were headed for Europe — across the water to Italy or Spain. They gave Azeteng the number for a smuggler named Sulemana. Sulemana told Azeteng to board an ordinary bus to Bamako, the capital of Mali, where they would meet. Azeteng had taught himself to record phone conversations, and he recorded his conversation with Sulemana and took detailed notes. The bus pulled out of Kinbu Junction. Azeteng wrote in his diary: “Saturday, April 15, 2017 — depart for Mali. 9.15am GMT.” The bus crossed into Burkina Faso and then Mali, via checkpoints where small amounts of money were extorted by the police. After three days they reached Bamako. Sulemana arranged a fake travel vaccination certificate for Azeteng and demanded 45,000 CFA — £60 — for the next stage of his trip up to Gao, where Azeteng would meet Sulemana’s boss, Moussa Sangare. At the bus station, somewhere close to a thousand migrants milled around in the heat. Azeteng took out his diary. “Every five minutes a bus will set off with African migrants and those trafficked,” he wrote. “It is more like a busy international airport.” He wrote down a detailed description of Sulemana and the smuggler's phone number, then he boarded the bus. After a few hours on the road, Sulemana called him. “If anyone asks you where you are going, tell them you are going to visit your relative,” he said. “Do not tell them you are going to Europe through the desert.” Sulemana told Azeteng to prepare for his cash to run out, and to have to call home to ask for more along the way. “It is like I told you,” he said. “The road is all about money.” After two days, the bus arrived in Gao — the gateway to the Sahara. Gao is a city of hot dust-red streets and mud-brick houses, where migrants flow hourly into the city’s main bus station. Many, like Azeteng, already have a phone number of one of the city’s connection men, who house migrants for a few days before selling them on to be taken across the desert. Anyone without a name and number is a target for coaxers — young men who board the buses outside the city to hustle migrants for their smuggling bosses. Azeteng knew to ask for Moussa Sangare and soon he was in Sangare’s ghetto house. He moved through the house discreetly taking photographs with his flip phone and writing down what he saw. Moussa Sangare appeared to take money from Malian security officers. He paid the connection men and boys who worked for him. When he had a certain number of migrants, he transferred them to the Tuaregs for the drive across the desert. Everything in his house — food, drinking water, a bath — cost money. After three nights in Gao, Azeteng was called up to pay the $400 fee to continue north. Here was the final moment of safety before the dangers of the open desert. Ahead of the migrants lay at least six days in the Sahara, but in all likelihood many more. EU-funded patrols were targeting the smugglers, pushing them to take longer, more remote routes. Trucks, laden with human cargo, became stuck. Migrants were dumped miles from cities and forced to walk, or waylaid for weeks as they worked to pay their way on. Out on the desert, the lines between smugglers and traffickers, victims and perpetrators, would blur. Sand dunes would shift in the wind, leading even seasoned drivers astray. But as Azeteng lined up to leave Gao, few seemed to dwell on the dangers ahead. The crowd buzzed at the imminent departure. In front of them were Toyota Hilux pick-up trucks which would ferry them to a warehouse to board larger, ageing transport trucks. Azeteng was packed into a truck with about 75 others — all men save for two Nigerian women, who sat up front with the driver. Azeteng sat on the floor at the back of the second truck, his knees close to his chest, filming with his phone. Somebody switched on a small bluetooth speaker and the migrants sang and danced to pop music. Different languages and dialects rang out over the din — French, Bambara, Mandingo, Twi. As the convoy hit the open desert, excitement rippled through the truck. But the migrants were headed into northern Mali, a lawless black spot bereft of government forces, humanitarian agencies and journalists; controlled by militias and beset by jihadists. Azeteng sat quietly, a knot tightening in his stomach. It was night when the trucks came to an abrupt stop, jolting Azeteng from a half-sleep. Voices called out from the dark, ordering the migrants to get out, and they were surrounded by men in military fatigues carrying AK-47s. They had hit the first Tuareg rebel checkpoint. The rebels fired shots into the air and ordered the migrants to line up to pay. Those who didn’t have enough money were told to form a separate line and had their pockets searched and possessions taken. Then they were beaten. Azeteng was hit hard in the side of the head, knocking his glasses off his face. A migrant in front of him was hit with a metal pole and bled from the mouth. A Gambian man, who Azeteng had befriended on the journey, held up his Koran and begged in vain for them to stop. Azeteng put his glasses back on and, overcoming a swell of fear, pressed the tiny button under the arm. The grainy footage captured the migrants shuffling past a militant holding out a large plastic bowl, depositing cash. When the bowl was full, another militant tipped it into a larger bowl. Those who had paid were ordered to sit on the sand and wait. The wind whipped up and the cold began to bite. It was then that Azeteng saw the two Nigerian women again, the women who had sat up front with the driver. Women from Nigeria, more than any other African nation, have fallen prey to the sex-trafficking trade to Europe. A well-established criminal network entraps them with promises of well-paid jobs as hairdressers or houseworkers or similar, then sells them into sex work. “As soon as they leave their family and community network they become extremely vulnerable,” Michele Bombassei, a UN expert on West African migration, told me. “And this is the moment the sexual exploitation begins.” Azeteng had spoken to the Nigerian women briefly, back in Bamako. They were confident and outgoing. They had joked and laughed. Now their heads were bowed, and Azeteng watched as they walked silently into the desert escorted by seven armed men from the checkpoint. The seven men gang-raped the two women on the desert floor, close enough that the migrants could see. When it was finished, the women were brought back and put in the front of the truck and the migrants were put in the back of the truck, and a heavy silence settled on them. The jubilation of earlier that day had given way to fear. No-one stood or danced or even spoke. Azeteng craned his neck and looked up at the stars, and they drove on through the night and the next morning and in the merciless heat of the afternoon they approached the second checkpoint. It was the crack of a rifle bullet brought them to a stop a second time — a warning shot that fizzed over their heads. Azeteng picked himself up from the bed of the truck and looked out and a chill ran through him. For the first time in his life, he saw a severed human head. Two severed human heads, mounted on wooden stakes — young men like him, he thought, probably migrants who made some small mistake. Horseflies buzzed around the heads, and blood had run down the wooden stakes and dried. The migrants were ordered to get down from the trucks and line up, and the grim events of the first checkpoint began to repeat themselves — the cash bowl, the beatings, the Nigerian women. Azeteng watched as the women walked again into the desert with half a dozen men. The migrants waited nearby, and the driver of the truck, who looked to be in his late 30s and wore traditional Muslim dress, and had shared the front cabin with the women, took a handful of sticks from a stash under the truck and slowly he made a fire. He filled a metal pot with water and poured in tea leaves and brought it to the boil. Darkness began to settle. The driver stirred the mixture for a while, and when he saw that the women were being brought back he poured the tea for them, and the three sat silently together by the small fire. The women’s faces looked so blank, Azeteng thought. Then the smugglers came shouting and rounded the migrants up. The trucks drove through the night, and the following morning brought more rebel checkpoints. At the fourth and final, Azeteng was hit in the leg with a metal pole so hard that he crumpled to the ground. The migrants spent that night on the sand, and the Nigerian women were taken away to an area where the smugglers slept, shielded by a canopy from view. When Azeteng awoke, a Senegalese migrant who was sleeping next to him — a tall, slim man in his 20s, who Azeteng liked because he laughed and played music and told loud stories about life in Senegal — said his arm itched. There was a small mark that had begun to swell. The migrants found a scorpion nearby and crushed it. In the truck, the Senegalese migrant scratched the sting and began to complain of chest pains and a headache. Every few minutes he asked for water and the migrants gave freely from their bottles. At the next stop, the border town of El-Khalil, the Senegalese migrant died later on the floor in a small room, surrounded by other migrants. The smugglers wrapped him in a white sheet and buried him in an unmarked grave in the sand. Azeteng wrote in his diary. “In the desert there are no friends and no family, and only God stands as your friend. There is no water, no food and no trees. The desert looks like the sea, and the sun is unbearable.” El-Khalil sits on the border of Mali and Algeria, a frontier trading post that began life in the early 1990s as an arms depot and evolved into an emporium for all manner of illegal trade — cigarettes, petrol, drugs, humans. Its mud-brick buildings are still bullet-scarred by a 2013 battle for control between Tuareg rebels and local Arab militia. Burned out trucks rest in the sand around its perimeter. Azeteng and the rest of the migrants were told to hand over any ID documents then packed into small rooms and made to stay inside. They survived on biscuits and water, which was always hot from sitting in the sun in plastic drums. The fee to cross to Algeria was $100. Azeteng offered to do chores for the smugglers in order to be near them. He ferried water and hung washing, and filmed them as they phoned migrants families to demand money transfers. A humming generator powered chargers that kept the collection of phones alive, and the smugglers laughed and listened to music as they demanded $100 through Orange Money transfer or Western Union. Azeteng wrote down the names, dates, and bank account numbers, and added them to his growing collection. He was taking an incomprehensible risk. A week after he arrived, four migrants who couldn’t raise enough money escaped in the night, setting off to walk the 16km (10 miles) to the first town over the border. The smugglers chased them down and brought them back — two alive, two dead. The migrants were rustled out of their rooms to watch as a smuggler pulled the bodies off the back of a pick-up truck. “This is what happens to whoever tries to run,” the smuggler said. From Azeteng's footage: people smugglers in El-Khalil, who call migrants' families and demand money transfers to secure the migrants' safe passage As well as spying on the smugglers, Azeteng turned his lens on migrants and locals. His footage and his diary became a catalogue of dreams, regrets, horror and humour on the road. “The road is not good,” said Daniel, a Guinean migrant who had been travelling with Azeteng since Gao. “The rebels ask you for money and if you do not have it they will tie you like a dangerous dog and put you in the sun. ""My god, my god, my god, this is very dangerous,” he said. “If you cannot pay the money you will never leave the desert.” A woman who sold food to the smugglers from a small storefront told Azeteng a long and funny story about a love affair with a Liberian army officer who smuggled cocaine through El Khalil, and she railed about men in general. “Their brains only work at night,” she sighed. Azeteng spent a little over two weeks in El-Khalil, until one afternoon he walked outside blinking into the sun, and was about to put on his glasses when he caught the eyes of a few idle smugglers, who beckoned him over. Just as he had practiced, Azeteng took the tiny memory card out of his glasses and put it discreetly into his mouth. A smuggler snatched the glasses and tried them on and laughed. Panic rose in Azeteng’s throat. Making too much of a scene would draw attention to the glasses, he thought, so he backed away, and in the dark of an outhouse, with the door wedged shut, he weighed his options. They killed migrants who tried to run. What would they do to a migrant spy? They tie you like a dangerous dog and put you in the sun. The words of the Guinean migrant rang in his head. You will never leave the desert. Azeteng waited in the outhouse until after nightfall, until he heard the sound of the smugglers drumming and the pah pah pah of their AK-47s firing into the sky. He knew he had to escape. Before he left the outhouse, he moved his memory card from inside his cheek on to his tongue, and swallowed. Then he went to his room to grab his few remaining things — a diary, a pair of trousers and a T-shirt, assorted notes and bus tickets, and a one-litre bottle of warm brackish water — and crawled out on to the sand. That night, in the desert, his mind drifted in the dark. He heard voices at his back, but when he turned he saw only sand. What is this, he thought. Are these ghosts? Are these the voices of the migrants who have died on the desert? Is someone going to take my soul?Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. His fear was compounded by a growing anxiety about losing his film footage — footage that was now in his stomach. He took the bottle of water from his knotted pullover and drank it in one go. Then he pushed his fingers down his throat until he vomited out the memory card, which he cleaned with his T-shirt and pushed into the pocket of his trousers. The first stop inside Algeria was Bordj Badji Mokhtar, about 15km across the desert as the crow flies but 26km if you follow the road that cuts through the sand. Azeteng walked slowly in what he hoped was the direction of Bordj. He had no water and he stopped often to rest. Eventually, the sun rose, and in the distance Azeteng saw cars passing intermittently on the road. When an Algerian army truck passed he thought he was saved, but it only slowed enough for the soldiers to throw a bottle of water at him and laugh as they sped off. A second truck carrying ice stopped and the driver gave him ice, but wouldn't take him. A third truck stopped and the driver gave him bread. For the first time on his journey, he became truly convinced he would lose his life. Finally, a fourth truck stopped, and a tradesman agreed to take him to Bordj. He didn’t speak English and Azeteng didn’t speak Arabic. Silently they rode north. Azeteng had been sustained by a fantasy borrowed from a movie — an undercover migrant on a mission to document the crimes of the smugglers. But by the time he entered Bordj, he had no papers, no money and no spy glasses, and the story he’d told himself began to unravel. He stayed with scores of others in an apartment where migrants slept in every available space, and the smell of camel meat drifted in day and night from the restaurant next door. A few days after he arrived, Algerian children threw stones at him and called him a “black migrant”. He wept in the street. He would need to work in Bordj in order to earn his way onwards, and he set about doing construction — mixing concrete, plastering, tiling. Sitting on the street one day, Azeteng saw Sekou, a young Guinean migrant he recognised from El-Khalil. Sekou was limping and bleeding from the nose and mouth. He had been severely beaten by the smugglers in El-Khalil, he said, and dumped in the desert 8km from Bordj. Azeteng helped Sekou to a hospital. Four days later, Sekou was dead. Some smugglers collected the body, and Azeteng followed them to a migrants’ graveyard near the edge of town. He watched as they took Sekou’s body from the bed of a pick-up. The dead man had been wrapped in a white sheet, one arm bound straight along his side and the other folded across his chest. They lowered the body into a shallow grave and covered it with sand and gravel and bricks. Adjacent to the migrants’ graveyard was a graveyard for Algerian citizens, with orderly plots and headstones. The migrants were buried haphazardly and close together, with nothing to mark their passing but the disturbance of the earth. Azeteng began to count, first one by one, then in rough batches, and by the time he gave up he’d counted 700 graves. Azeteng went straight from the graveyard to where Sekou’s few belongings had been left and he picked out the dead man’s ID. In the picture, Sekou had closely cropped hair and a sharp, handsome face. The details on the ID card were plain. Sex: Male. Nationality: Guinea. Profession: Trader. Year of birth: 1996. Azeteng put the ID card in his pocket. He needed to keep moving. It was early June, and the smugglers said there would be cars leaving in five days for Algiers — a three day, 1,500km journey across the desert. Azeteng went to an internet cafe, copied his memory cards on to a computer and emailed himself the footage. Then he wiped the files from the hard drive, like he’d seen in films, and prepared to leave. Three days later he was crammed with 14 other migrants — two for each seat — into a Toyota Land Cruiser. Azeteng could not move enough even to look left or right or raise a water bottle to his lips. They were heading into an arid stretch of the Sahara that in the height of summer is among the hottest places on earth. After about 10km, the cars paused so the driver could scan for Algerian army trucks from a steep dune, and the migrants stretched their legs. The desert looked like a rolling sea, Azeteng thought. His teeth were sore and turning brown and he had given up trying to rub the sand from his hair. His limbs ached, particularly his leg, where a deep purple bruise had flowered. The driver returned and the migrants were crammed again into the Land Cruiser and they set off, and after 100km they were transferred to a minibus for the long, largely featureless desert ride to Algiers. Around the time Azeteng was crossing Algeria, the country was breaking in a new policy of aggressive migrant deportations that would see thousands of people dumped in the desert over the following year. Sub-Saharan Africans were rounded up en masse — from the street, from construction sites, from their homes — and deposited in an empty stretch of desert called Point Zero. According to Human Rights Watch, men, women and young children were forced, some at gunpoint, to walk up to 30km through the blistering desert heat until they reached the nearest town. Ahmed Ouyahia, then Algeria’s cabinet chief, said that African migrants were a “source of criminality and drugs”. In reality, they were mostly a source of low- or unpaid labour on construction sites from Bordj to Algiers. Dozens of migrants who flowed back from Algeria through Niger in early 2018 reported being sold by traffickers into slavery. Ibrahim Musah, a Ghanaian migrant who followed the same route as Azeteng, five months earlier, told me he was bussed directly to a Turkish-run construction site in Algiers to register, then to a compound where West African migrants slept on cots in temporary cabins, which is where he met Azeteng one day in June, and became the first person Azeteng told on his journey about his secret filming. “He was doing a good thing,” Ibrahim told me. “But if the smugglers see you filming they will kill you. They will kill you,” he said. The pair became friends. Ibrahim started out from Ghana with almost no money, and he was subjected to levels of hardship and brutality that Azeteng had paid to avoid. Locked into debt bondage, he worked for five months in Mali and Algeria with little or no pay. “It is so hard, so hard,” he said. “Work, work, work, work, work.” He pinched a fold of his skin. “My body was not good, it changed because of no food.” Ibrahim walked for five days in the desert after he and others were dumped by the smugglers, he said. He saw hands and feet sticking out of the sand, and helped bury a man who sat down on a dune one day, closed his eyes, and died. dfvsad Days passed on the construction site in Algiers. Azeteng and Ibrahim were barely paid or fed, and raids by Algerian security forces became more frequent. When Ibrahim heard the Algerians were dumping migrants in the desert, he made his way to a UN camp in Niger and was repatriated to Ghana. Azeteng left the site and spent a few nights on the streets in Algiers, then he did something he hoped he would never do — he begged. He was largely ignored or swatted away, until he approached a 21-year-old Algerian law student called Houssem, who became the second person Azeteng told on his journey about his secret spectacles. “I always remember his face, he was in a bad situation,” Houssem told me. “He was tired and confused.” The two sat and spoke for a while, about racism, migration, life in Africa. Houssem asked Azeteng how much he thought it would cost him to get back to Ghana. He drove Azeteng via his house to the bus stop, and gave him 35,000 dinars — £220 — for the journey home, and told him to stay in touch, and he never asked for the money back. “I did what my heart told me to do,” Houssem said. “That's all.” Azeteng boarded the bus and began the long journey home, via Mali and Burkina Faso, by smuggling routes and ordinary bus journeys, and in the early hours of 2 July he passed the Ghanaian border, and made the sign of the cross. Neil Abbott is the only officer of the British National Crime Agency based in Accra. His job is to help local law enforcement agencies police major crimes, like drug smuggling, modern slavery and human trafficking. In August 2017, Abbott was at a conference in Accra at the UN migration agency, the IOM, when an employee told him about a package that had appeared in their mailroom — a crazy story about a migrant spy. Back at the NCA offices, Abbott paid a visit to the mailroom and found a brown paper envelope, hand delivered. “It was undercover recordings, photographs, interviews with potential offenders and potential victims,” Abbott told me. “He’d collected all this information, bus tickets, travel itinerary… He had leaflets about agencies and transport depots, he’d marked phone numbers, names, bank account numbers…” After he’d got back to Ghana, Azeteng had compiled copies of his evidence into packets and delivered them to various UN offices and the UK, US and Ghanaian embassies. Then he waited, and he had almost given up hope when he got two calls in a week, one from the British and one from the Americans. At the end of his long journey, Azeteng found himself, to his surprise, in a secure compound inside the British High Commission, on a leafy street in an upmarket part of Accra, telling his story to the UK National Crime Agency. I met Abbott there in February, and asked him what he made of Azeteng’s journey. “As a law enforcement officer, clearly there’s a story there for us, and potentially a witness to crimes that we can do something about,” he said. Abbott and a colleague debriefed Azeteng over three weeks, carefully going over his story and physical evidence. Azeteng excitedly met every question with detail after detail. He drew maps and copied out names, locations, and the number plates of trucks. He produced strange artefacts from his journey — a camel bone from his walk through the night, a coin from the pocket of a migrant who died. Then, three months later, in February 2018, Azeteng got a call asking him to come back to the NCA offices. They told him that parts of his evidence had been sent to law enforcement in Mali and used in operations in Gao that resulted in the arrests of suspected people-smugglers. “I can't go into who those people are, the specifics of it, because there are ongoing investigations and we don't want to prejudice any prosecutions that may happen in the future,” Abbott told me. “However, proactive action was taken within countries such as Mali that resulted in positive outcomes for that country.” The technical language masked something that meant the world to Azeteng — his journey had not been in vain. He had gone undercover, and contributed in some way to fighting crimes against migrants. He was elated. But Abbott told him something else too: that his journey had been foolish and reckless, and that he could just as easily have lost his life. “He’s one young man on this epic journey and he’s put his life on the line,” Abbott told me. “Make no bones about it, the journey these victims go on, and they are victims — they start off thinking they’re going to get a better life and halfway through they run out of money and end up being trafficked, and they are in the hands of these merciless people. “These stories happen daily,” he said. “I'm sure it's happening as we speak.” I visited Azeteng in February, at his home in a small town just outside Accra, where he lives in a single room in a stone and clay-soil hut that encompasses two rooms, of which the other is a sheep coop. The building sits on the edge of a communal space with a rough dirt floor, overhung by washing lines and populated by meandering livestock, in a slum-like settlement built along the side of a rail track that runs through the town on a low gravel berm. In a box in the corner of the room, Azeteng keeps all the bits and pieces he collected on his journey — bus tickets, pictures, memory cards, a fake vaccination certificate and more. One item still bothers him, and he takes it out occasionally to look at. When Azeteng got back to Ghana, he went to the Guinean embassy and told them he needed help to find the family of a Guinean man who had died on the desert. “I have his ID card,” he told the ambassador’s assistant. “Name: Sekou. Sex: Male. Nationality: Guinea. Profession: Trader. Year of birth: 1996.” Azeteng waited for three hours, until the assistant told him the embassy could not help and ushered him out. I asked him why he took Sekou’s ID in the first place. “That is someone’s son, someone’s brother, who knows, maybe even someone’s father,” he said. “I asked myself, how will his family know that he is dead? So I am trying my best for the family to be aware.” In Kumasi, 200km to the north, Azeteng's friend Ibrahim was finishing work for the day. His repatriation from Algeria to Ghana had transplanted him from one construction site to another. The wages were better but the work was patchy, and he was not earning nearly enough to support his family. Then there was the shame of coming home at all, he said, of not having sent any money from Europe. “I tried. I tried, I tried, I tried,” he said, softly. “But I failed.” It may be that the full effects of the recent wave of African migration towards Europe are not felt for years to come. Azeteng told me his story with care and attention and in meticulous detail, until, several times, he broke down in tears. “What I have seen with my eyes is not easy,” he said. Of the tens of thousands who have died on the journey, most stories will never fully be known, even to their families. For some who return, the ordeal will continue, in the form of stigma for a perceived failure to provide. It is a generational trauma. As the sun fell, we walked from Azeteng’s settlement through sandy backroads to a church for evening mass, led by the same priest he had confided in before he left. After the Eucharist had been administered and the tithe collected, and the parishioners had finished singing, the small congregation filed out into the night. There was a perfectly clear sky, and Azeteng lingered under the stars to wait for the priest. “When I was walking alone in the desert, you could see the moon just like this,” he said quietly. “I saw an aeroplane overhead and its lights were blinking, and I prayed that it would fall and pick me up and rescue me.” I asked him what he would say to someone considering the journey to Europe. “You will never find greener pastures on the desert,” he said. The priest emerged from the church and Azeteng thanked him for the sermon. Then he set off walking back in the direction of his room. He was saving up again, he said, but this time for a diploma in journalism. In a felt pouch in his pocket were his new secret spectacles. In his bag was Sekou’s ID.

The 'star-maker' who abused young footballers,"Bob Higgins was youth development officer at Southampton until 1989 Such was the influence of Bob Higgins as a youth coach at Southampton, he was known as the ""star-maker"". He was seen as instrumental in the development of several players who would go on to become household names; during his time at Southampton, players of the calibre of future England stars Alan Shearer and Matt Le Tissier broke into the football club's first team. But Bob Higgins was also a ruthless, predatory paedophile, who used his position of power to groom and then abuse boys whose dreams of a playing career he could make or break. Nearly 30 years after he was first accused - and cleared - of sexual abuse, the crimes of 66-year-old Higgins have finally caught up with him, with his conviction at Bournemouth Crown Court of 45 counts of indecent assault. His unmasking as a serial sex offender was the consequence ofscores of former players coming forward in 2016, when the extent of historical abuse in the game began to become clear. When, at the time of the scandal, the NSPCC set up a dedicated phone line to offer support to victims, 87 people called the charity and a further 32 contacted police directly with allegations of abuse relating to Southampton. One name - and only one name - was mentioned time and again in connection with abuse at Southampton: Bob Higgins. Higgins abused youth players in his care over several decades The eight-week retrial - held after a previous jury at Winchester Crown Court could not reach verdicts on 48 counts of indecent assault - was told Higgins kept an open house at his homes in Camberley, Surrey, and later Southampton. He would let boys stay there while they attended training sessions at weekends or during school holidays. This allowed him to groom his victims. He would give players lifts to and from training, playing songs by Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie in an effort to create a romantic mood. Sitting on the sofa at his home, he would demand cuddles from the boys and go on to touch them inappropriately. He would also use the pretext of treating injuries or performing soap-water massages to abuse youngsters at the club. There is no suggestion that any of the club's biggest names who were coached by Higgins - including the likes of Danny Wallace and Steve Williams, as well as Shearer and Le Tissier - were abused by him. But many of those youth players who were sexually assaulted were left so distressed that they gave up football entirely. This video can not be played Billy Seymour, a charity ambassador campaigning against abuse in football, waived his right to anonymity Billy Seymour, a trainee at Southampton from 1983 until 1986, was one of them. He died before he could see his abuser face justice - although Higgins was found guilty of a single count of indecent assault at the earlier trial in 2018. The 47-year-old died in a crash in Oxfordshire in January, shortly before the retrial was due to begin. In an unusual step, audio of his appearance in the witness box from the first trial was played to the jury in the retrial, as well as a video of his police interview. Mr Seymour said his life ""unravelled"" after the abuse; he struggled with anger issues and served time in prison. The court heard how he ""nearly killed"" a taxi driver he had threatened to attack with a plasterer's knife, as he reminded him of Higgins. Shortly before being sentenced, he told his mother that his victim ""looked like Bob, smelt like Bob"", adding: ""He's inside me."" England internationals Alan Shearer and Matt Le Tissier were coached by Higgins Rumours about Higgins's activities had circulated for years. Nonetheless, the court heard how the coach was trusted by parents and idolised by youngsters, providing him with the cover he needed. There was an implicit trade-off: boys knew they needed to keep quiet or risk losing their shot at a career as a footballer. Many said nothing, even to close family members, for up to 30 years. Higgins left Southampton in 1989 after being confronted by a colleague who had overheard youth players sharing stories about him. He went on trial in the early 1990s but was acquitted. This allowed him to remain in football for many more years - and to continue offending. It was only in 2016, when victims of child abuse in football aired their experiences on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, that a stream of complainants, including Mr Seymour, came forward. The police reopened their investigation and began to build a new case against Higgins. This video can not be played Matt Le Tissier said he was given a ""very, very wrong"" massage by Higgins Described in court as a ""rubbish"" player, he had nevertheless been a respected scout and youth coach. Higgins joined Southampton in the early 1970s and over the next two decades played a key role in bringing through some of the club's best players. In the 1980s, Wallace and Williams, both acknowledged as his discoveries, were part of one of Southampton's most successful teams. Higgins also helped develop the skills of Shearer and Le Tissier. When the football abuse scandal broke in 2016, Shearer said he had ""huge respect and admiration"" for former team-mates who had come forward. ""Whilst I am lucky and have no personal experience of the terrible stories that have been described, I know from my work as an NSPCC ambassador the pain and lasting damage abuse can cause."" Le Tissier told the BBC in 2016 he had been given a ""naked massage"" by Higgins. In the interview, Le Tissier said he was not abused but the incident was ""very, very wrong"". This video can not be played Les Cleevely was abused while watching Match of the Day at Higgins's home Les Cleevely, who went on to become a successful goalkeeping coach, recalled how, as a 12-year-old schoolboy scouted by Higgins, he was ""mesmerised"" by the ""young, trendy and charismatic"" coach. Like many others, he was invited to stay at Higgins's house. He described his night there as a ""horror story"". ""The whole thing [the abuse] went on in pitch black while we were watching Match of the Day,"" he said. ""So for the entire length of Match of the Day it was horrendous. ""And then the rest of the night spent at the house was with your eyes wide open wondering what was going to happen next. ""He had power over our careers. It was everything we wanted in life as kids he held the key to. Some people thought, 'is it going to put my situation in jeopardy?'"" This video can not be played Jamie Webb eventually tore up his contract with Southampton Jamie Webb still recalls the ""magical moment"" he joined the club and met Higgins at Southampton's then home, The Dell. ""I was really in awe. I couldn't believe, walking down the old Dell steps,"" he said. But Mr Webb says his memories of his time at the club are tainted by the abuse he was subjected to by Higgins while he stayed at his house. ""We were all vying for affection in a way and the banter would be more like, 'Oh Bob loves you and you're one of Bob's favourites',"" he said. ""It was almost what you wanted to hear. I'd get given kit. Sometimes I'd buy some kit and I'd get an extra top thrown in and shorts."" At the time he was pleased with the attention, but now he sees the behaviour for what it was. ""For me, it's just grooming."" Boys would be invited to stay with Higgins and his wife Shirley during weekend and school holiday training camps Jurors were told Higgins would play pop songs on the car stereo as he touched boys inappropriately while driving to and from training sessions. Mr Seymour recalled Whitney Houston's Greatest Love of All playing and Higgins telling him: ""It reminds me of you."" ""Whenever it comes on, it takes me back,"" he told the court last year. ""Looking back, I tried to normalise it, but it wasn't normal to be in that situation."" Such was his emotional hold over them that many boys wrote Higgins letters, expressing love and gratitude, calling him a ""second father"" or a ""brother"". One victim said it made him physically sick when he was recently shown a letter he had written to Higgins. ""I was only 13 and I was just a kid and I didn't know any different,"" he said. ""Bob would put you under a lot of pressure to write those letters. ""He'd basically show you letters of famous players. You wanted to be that player and I wanted my career, and whatever it took, I'd do that."" Lawrie McMenemy said Higgins would have been ""out of the door"" if the club's management had known about his abuse Lawrie McMenemy, Southampton's manager between 1973 and 1985, said he had not been in any way aware of Higgins's offending during his time in charge of the club. ""I didn't know he was taking kids home,"" he said. ""None of my staff knew that. ""It's horrific what he's done. If we'd have known, he wouldn't have lasted two minutes. He'd have been out the door."" Rumours about Higgins's activities were certainly circulating by the late 1980s, though. Dave Merrington, who was youth team manager and would later manage the first team, recalled being ""troubled and disturbed"" when he heard banter among players in a minibus. Dave Merrington said he challenged Higgins, who threatened to sue anyone who made claims about him ""I realised they were talking about Bob,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the comments were of a sexual nature that I wasn't happy about."" He raised the matter at a staff meeting and was told it would be brought to the attention of the board. Later, he was told he should be the one to raise the issue with Higgins, which he did at a meeting in the players' lounge at The Dell. ""He jumped up, got extremely annoyed and said: 'I'll sue anyone who says anything about me,'"" Mr Merrington said. ""I tried to cool him down but he got extremely annoyed. He stormed out. Within a week or a fortnight he had resigned, as I understand it, and left the club."" A police investigation followed and Higgins was accused of abusing six boys, but he was acquitted of one charge in 1991 and the other charges were discontinued. Mr Merrington had given evidence along with complainant Dean Radford, who was 18 when he came forward in 1989. Dean Radford signed with Southampton as a schoolboy ""For a boy to open up at that particular stage of his career - he was a very, very brave young man,"" Mr Merrington said. ""No-one from the club spoke to us about [the court case]. That disappoints and hurts me. ""I felt the system let him down very badly."" Guy Askham, who was Southampton chairman at the time, said the club's board had been part-timers who tried their best to deal with the issue. ""We believed the board had taken the right decision in reporting the allegations to the police,"" he said. This video can not be played Former Southampton player Dean Radford talking in 2016 about the abuse he suffered Mr Radford recalled being ""scared to death"" giving evidence and being cross-examined. ""I was just told on the telephone he'd been found not guilty,"" he said. ""They let it go. That was it, he was a free man."" Following Higgins's acquittal, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction on the remaining charges. Higgins gave an interview to the Southampton Daily Echo newspaper, headlined: ""My two years of hell"", and continued working in football, taking up a coaching job with the Malta Football Association. He stayed there until 1994 when he began working with youth players at Peterborough United. The court heard how Higgins, who had recently claimed to have become a Christian, baptised boys in his bath at home. Two charges in the retrial related to cases at Peterborough. One witness told the trial he was assaulted 10 to 20 times in Higgins's home. Hampshire and Southampton social services warned parents about Higgins in 1997 Allegations against Higgins were aired again in January 1997 in a Channel 4 documentary. After the Dispatches programme, both Hampshire and Southampton social services consulted police and wrote to local youth organisations expressing concern about him coaching boys. A joint letter from the departments, unearthed by the BBC through a Freedom of Information request, urged parents to ""make an informed choice about his contact with your child/ren"". Dr John Beer, the head of Southampton Social Services at the time, said he received several replies from parents criticising him for impugning Higgins's good character. ""That is the standard way that we learn that paedophiles operated,"" he said. ""The safest way for them is to groom parents and figures who have status in the community, so if the young person made any allegations they were likely to be disbelieved."" What next for football's abuse investigations? '80 coaches convicted of child sex abuse' Justice has been served - Bennell victims Higgins continued in the game in Hampshire, with coaching roles at Bashley, Winchester City and Fleet Town, until the football abuse scandal broke in 2016 and his career in football was finally brought to an end. Det Ch Insp David Brown, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme had been the ""catalyst"" that prompted many more victims to come forward. But with allegations dating back decades, there was no forensic evidence or any paperwork that could provide a ""smoking gun"" to convict Higgins. This video can not be played Bob Higgins ""did not speak a single word"" during 15 hours of interviews, police said Moreover, the media coverage, which encouraged more victims to come forward, proved a doubled-edged sword for the investigation team. It meant they had to interview all of the complainants quickly to ensure they did not communicate with one other ahead of a trial and potentially jeopardise the criminal case. Their testimony confirmed a pattern of predatory behaviour from Higgins. ""We had a large number of people and it was repeated similar factual evidence - the same songs played in the car, the same activities, the same bedtime routines - that helped build a compelling case,"" Det Ch Insp Brown said. Young players would train in the gym at The Dell Detectives were unable to trace all the paperwork from the legal proceedings in the 1990s. However, they found trial documents from an unlikely source - Higgins himself. When they searched Higgins's house they discovered detailed accounts of the trial, statements boys had made to police, as well as memorabilia, letters and photos from the 1980s. ""Much of the material he retained was used as evidence of controlling, coercive behaviour,"" Det Insp Brown said. Several victims and witnesses at the recent trial explained how they had not felt able to talk of the abuse when interviewed by police in the early 1990s. ""I was not ready - mentally, physically or emotionally - to divulge the horrific things that had happened to me,"" Mr Seymour told the court. ""I knew something was seriously, seriously wrong. I was just not ready to deal with it at that precise moment."" Higgins's wife Shirley stood by him in court. She claimed Mr Merrington had a ""vendetta"" against her husband and boys had been cajoled into making allegations against him. She said she had acted as a ""second mother"" to the youngsters staying at their house. When asked if she had ever seen her husband act inappropriately with any boys, Mrs Higgins replied: ""No. Never. I wouldn't be married to him for 45 years if he had."" Mrs Higgins said it was she who had kept cards and photos from young footballers, which she said gave her ""happy memories"". Higgins covered his face while entering and leaving court throughout the retrial at Bournemouth Crown Court However, after more than a week of deliberation, the jury found Higgins guilty of dozens of offences. For his victims, it meant a long wait for justice was over. Police believe more abuse survivors could come forward following his conviction. Double jeopardy rules meant Mr Radford, whom Higgins was cleared of abusing nearly 30 years ago, was unable to be a complainant in the recent trials. However, he did give evidence as a witness. ""I'd like him to sit behind bars and know that he's there partly because of me,"" he said. Victims have spoken about how they remain haunted by the abuse. Many are also left wondering about what might have been. Mr Webb eventually tore up his contract with Southampton. Now in his 40s, he cannot know how far he could have gone in football. ""A lot of people said I was good and everything, but it's hard looking back on that period. ""I just used to say to people that I wasn't mentally focused. I'll never know what might have been.""

Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions',"Prochlorperazine is prescribed for nausea and dizziness Four pharmaceutical firms have been accused of illegally colluding to restrict the supply of an anti-nausea tablet, driving the price paid for it by the NHS up by 700%. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the cost of prochlorperazine rose from Â£6.49 per pack to Â£51.68, after suppliers agreed not to compete. The drug is often prescribed to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. One of the firms named, Alliance Pharma, denied the allegations. In a statement of objections,,externalthe CMA says that between 2013 and 2018, the annual cost of 3mg dissolvable prochlorperazine tablets increased from approximately Â£2.7m to Â£7.5m, even though the NHS dispensed fewer packs during that period. It claimed that sharp increase was the result of four companies - Alliance Pharma, Focus, Lexon and Medreich - agreeing not to compete against each other for the supply of the prescription-only pills. Alliance supplied prochlorperazine exclusively to Focus, which the CMA says then paid Lexon a share of its profits from the sales. Lexon, the competition regulator alleges, then shared these payments with Medreich. Chemotherapy patients are often prescribed prochlorperazine to help with dizziness The CMA alleges that, before entering into this arrangement, Lexon and Medreich had been planning to launch their own jointly-developed prochlorperazine. In a statement, Alliance said it had ""no involvement in the pricing or distribution of prochlorperazine since 2013, when it was out-licensed by the company to Focus Pharmaceuticals Limited on an exclusive basis as is normal market practice"". The firm added: ""Alliance has not had control of or influence on, and nor has it benefited from, any price increases."" The BBC has contacted Focus, Lexon and Medreich for comment. The CMA's Ann Pope said: ""Agreements where a company pays a rival not to enter the market can lead to higher prices and deprive the NHS of huge savings that often result from competition between drug suppliers. ""The NHS should not be denied the opportunity of benefitting from an increased choice of suppliers, or lower prices, for important medicine."" The companies concerned will now have the opportunity to respond to the CMA's provisional findings. If it eventually determines that competition law has been broken, the CMA can impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of each company's worldwide turnover.

Wreck of 'last US slave ship' found in Alabama,"A mural of the Clotilda in the city of Mobile, Alabama The last ship known to have smuggled slaves from Africa to the US is said to have been discovered after a year-long investigation. The remains of the Clotilda were found at the bottom of the Mobile river in Alabama. The ship was used to smuggle men, women and children into America from Africa. It operated in secret, decades after Congress banned the importation of slaves, and was intentionally sunk in 1860 to hide evidence of its use. ""The discovery of the Clotilda is an extraordinary archaeological find,"" Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, executive director of the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC), told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. The ship's journey ""represented one of the darkest eras of modern history"" and the wreck provides ""tangible evidence of slavery"", she said. Last survivor of US slave ships discovered US university helps slavery descendants The Clotilda was discovered by archaeology firm company Search Inc, which was called in to help by the Alabama Historical Commission to investigate the hulk, says the National Geographic Society, which reported the find. Researchers discovered a ship with its identifying features under water in a section of the Mobile river,external, says National Geographic. A statue of Cudjoe Lewis, who was brought to the US on the Clotilda The dimensions and construction of the wreck matched those of the Clotilda, as did building materials, the commission said. ""We are cautious about placing names on shipwrecks that no longer bear a name or something like a bell with the ship's name on it,"" maritime archaeologist James Delgado said in a statement. ""But the physical and forensic evidence powerfully suggests that this is Clotilda."" The US banned the importation of slaves in 1808, but the slave trade carried on beyond this date as there was still demand for workers from southern plantation owners. A wealthy landowner and shipbuilder from Mobile is said to have made a bet with northern businessmen that he could smuggle a cargo of African slaves into Mobile Bay under the nose of federal officials, National Geographic says. The Clotilda carried 110 men, women and children from Benin to Alabama in 1860, according to historians. ""It's the best documented story of a slave voyage in the western hemisphere,"" historian Sylviane Anna Diouf - who relied on testimony from the slave traders and their captives, some of whom lived in the 20th Century - told National Geographic. Some descendants of those carried on the ship still live nearby in an area that came to be known as Africatown. They have welcomed the discovery. ""I think about the people who came before us who laboured and fought and worked so hard,"" Joycelyn Davis, a sixth-generation granddaughter of one of the slaves, told AP. ""I'm sure people had given up on finding it. It's a wow factor.""

Iraq's Christians 'close to extinction',"Iraq's Christian community is one of the oldest in the world The Archbishop of Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, has accused Britain's Christian leaders of failing to do enough in defence of the vanishing Christian community in Iraq. In an impassioned address in London, the Rt Rev Bashar Warda said Iraq's Christians now faced extinction after 1,400 years of persecution. Since the US-led invasion toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, he said, the Christian community had dwindled by 83%, from around 1.5 million to just 250,000. ""Christianity in Iraq,"" he said, ""one of the oldest Churches, if not the oldest Church in the world, is perilously close to extinction. Those of us who remain must be ready to face martyrdom."" He referred to the current, pressing threat from Islamic State (IS) jihadists as a ""final, existential struggle"", following the group's initial assault in 2014 that displaced more than 125,000 Christians from their historic homelands. ""Our tormentors confiscated our present,"" he said, ""while seeking to wipe out our history and destroy our future. In Iraq there is no redress for those who have lost properties, homes and businesses. Tens of thousands of Christians have nothing to show for their life's work, for generations of work, in places where their families have lived, maybe, for thousands of years."" Iraq's minorities fear for their future Christian persecution 'at near genocide levels' The Christian militia fighting IS IS, known in the Arab world as Daesh, was driven from its last stronghold at Baghuz in Syria in March after a massive multinational military campaign, effectively spelling the end of its self-declared ""caliphate"". Before that, it had already been expelled from Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2017. This video can not be played The Iraqi Christian ghost town But churches, monasteries and homes belonging to Christian families have been decimated and thousands of families have not returned. This week the archbishop warned of what he said were a growing number of extremist groups that asserted that the killing of Christians and Yazidis helped to spread Islam. The archbishop went on to accuse Britain's Christian leaders of ""political correctness"" over the issue - he called the failure to condemn extremism ""a cancer"", saying they were not speaking out loudly enough for fear of being accused of Islamophobia. ""Will you continue to condone this never-ending, organised persecution against us?"" he said. ""When the next wave of violence begins to hit us, will anyone on your campuses hold demonstrations and carry signs that say 'We are all Christians'?"" Iraqi Christians have been targeted by Islamist militants, including IS His views on political correctness are shared,externalin part by the Bishop of Truro, the Rt Rev Philip Mounstephen, who chairs the Independent Review into the Foreign Office's response to the persecution of Christians worldwide. ""I think the archbishop is right that a culture of 'political correctness' has prevented Western voices from speaking out about the persecution of Christians,"" he says. ""I think though this is mainly to do with a reluctance borne of post-colonial guilt."" Bishop Mounstephen maintains that Christian persecution needs to be viewed from a global perspective and has multiple causes. ""If we only consider it in the light of Islamic militancy,"" he says, ""we let a lot of other people off the hook who should otherwise be held to account."" Taking a historical perspective, the Archbishop of Irbil lamented the fact that in centuries past there was a happy period of fruitful cooperation between Christians and Muslims in Iraq, a time that historians have referred to as the Islamic Golden Age. ""Our Christian ancestors shared with Muslim Arabs a deep tradition of thought and philosophy,"" says Archbishop Warda. ""They engaged with them in respectful dialogue from the 8th Century. ""A style of scholastic dialogue had developed, and which could only occur because a succession of caliphs [Islamic political and religious leaders] tolerated minorities. As toleration ended, so did the culture and wealth which flowed from it."" Elsewhere in the Middle East it is a mixed picture for Christians in 2019. Egypt's Copts, who constitute at least 10% of the country's 100 million-plus population, have come under sustained attack from jihadists who have bombed their churches and attempted to drive them out of northern Sinai. But in February Pope Francis made a historic three-day visit to the UAE - the first ever by a pontiff to the Arabian Peninsula - in which he held a mass attended by an estimated 135,000 mostly migrant Catholics. The archbishop warned the West not to be complicit through inaction And in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and a country that has enforced a narrow, austere interpretation of Islam for the last 40 years, the first Coptic Christian mass was allowed in December. In Syria, the Christian minority felt deeply threatened by the largely Islamist element amongst the rebel groups. With President Assad's forces now in the ascendant, as a result of some often brutal tactics, Syria's Christians may be breathing a small sigh of relief. In Iraq though, the outlook for Christians remains bleak. Sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims persist and there are still unknown numbers of IS fighters hiding out in the north and west of the country. Archbishop Warda has reached a bitter conclusion about what the future holds. ""Friends, we may be facing our end in the land of our ancestors. We acknowledge this. In our end, the entire world faces a moment of truth. ""Will a peaceful and innocent people be allowed to be persecuted and eliminated because of their faith? And, for the sake of not wanting to speak the truth to the persecutors, will the world be complicit in our elimination?""

"Wreck of 'last US slave ship' found in AlabamaThe wreck of the Clotilda, which smuggled slaves to the US, is found after a year-long search.","A mural of the Clotilda in the city of Mobile, Alabama The last ship known to have smuggled slaves from Africa to the US is said to have been discovered after a year-long investigation. The remains of the Clotilda were found at the bottom of the Mobile river in Alabama. The ship was used to smuggle men, women and children into America from Africa. It operated in secret, decades after Congress banned the importation of slaves, and was intentionally sunk in 1860 to hide evidence of its use. ""The discovery of the Clotilda is an extraordinary archaeological find,"" Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, executive director of the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC), told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. The ship's journey ""represented one of the darkest eras of modern history"" and the wreck provides ""tangible evidence of slavery"", she said. Last survivor of US slave ships discovered US university helps slavery descendants The Clotilda was discovered by archaeology firm company Search Inc, which was called in to help by the Alabama Historical Commission to investigate the hulk, says the National Geographic Society, which reported the find. Researchers discovered a ship with its identifying features under water in a section of the Mobile river,external, says National Geographic. A statue of Cudjoe Lewis, who was brought to the US on the Clotilda The dimensions and construction of the wreck matched those of the Clotilda, as did building materials, the commission said. ""We are cautious about placing names on shipwrecks that no longer bear a name or something like a bell with the ship's name on it,"" maritime archaeologist James Delgado said in a statement. ""But the physical and forensic evidence powerfully suggests that this is Clotilda."" The US banned the importation of slaves in 1808, but the slave trade carried on beyond this date as there was still demand for workers from southern plantation owners. A wealthy landowner and shipbuilder from Mobile is said to have made a bet with northern businessmen that he could smuggle a cargo of African slaves into Mobile Bay under the nose of federal officials, National Geographic says. The Clotilda carried 110 men, women and children from Benin to Alabama in 1860, according to historians. ""It's the best documented story of a slave voyage in the western hemisphere,"" historian Sylviane Anna Diouf - who relied on testimony from the slave traders and their captives, some of whom lived in the 20th Century - told National Geographic. Some descendants of those carried on the ship still live nearby in an area that came to be known as Africatown. They have welcomed the discovery. ""I think about the people who came before us who laboured and fought and worked so hard,"" Joycelyn Davis, a sixth-generation granddaughter of one of the slaves, told AP. ""I'm sure people had given up on finding it. It's a wow factor.""

European election voting begins across UK,"The polls have closed in the UK for the European Parliament elections. Seventy-three members, known as MEPs, will be elected in nine constituencies in England, and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region's number of representatives is based on its population - from three MEPs in north-east England and Northern Ireland to 10 in south-east England. The results will be announced once all EU nations have voted, expected to be completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday. How the BBC reports polling day European elections: What you need to know EU citizens in UK turned away from polls The Netherlands also voted on Thursday while voting in other EU nations will take place at various times over the next three days. Voters had to be registered to vote, be 18 years old or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country. They had to be resident at a UK address (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not be legally excluded from voting. MEPs are elected in the order listed by their party, based on the total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, and each voter can choose one party or individual to back. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used, allowing voters to rank the parties standing in order of preference. 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do MEPs get elected?

May faces pressure as Brexit bill delayed,"Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal bill will not be published or debated until early June, the government says. The prime minister is under pressure to resign following a backlash from her own MPs against her pledged ""new deal"" on Brexit. Andrea Leadsom quit as Commons Leader, saying she could not announce the bill which had ""new elements that I fundamentally oppose"". She has been replaced by Treasury minister Mel Stride. Downing Street has confirmed that the prime minister met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid at No 10 on Thursday morning and would ""give full consideration their views"" about the bill. Mrs May hadtold the Commons,externalthat the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU - would be published on Friday so MPs would have ""the maximum possible time to study its detail"". This video can not be played Government delays Brexit bill publication Mrs Leadsom had been due to announce when it would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday, but resigned on Wednesday night. Standing in for her, government whip Mark Spencer told MPs: ""We will update the House on the publication and introduction of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on our return from the Whitsun recess."" He added that the government planned to publish the bill in the first week of June. ""We had hoped to hold second reading on Friday 7 June,"" he added. ""At the moment, we have not secured agreement to this in the usual channels. Of course we will update the House when we return from recess."" Second reading is when MPs get a first chance to debate legislation, before deciding whether it should proceed to detailed scrutiny. Responding for Labour, shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said: ""The prime minister has once again put her own political survival ahead of the national interest. ""It is clear that the prime minister does not command a majority in her approach to Brexit and she has failed to accept this political reality."" US President Donald Trump is due to make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Asked who would be in 10 Downing Street when he arrives, Mr Hunt said: ""Theresa May will be prime minister to welcome him and rightly so."" It is possible for Mrs May to quit as Conservative leader before Mr Trump's visit, but continue as prime minister on a caretaker basis. Mrs Leadsom said on Thursday she had ""no doubts that I made the right decision"" adding: ""I felt I couldn't, in all conscience, stand up and deliver the business statement today with a Withdrawal Agreement Bill in it that I couldn't support elements of."" She did not answer questions about whether she was planning to run for the leadership. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. In a mini-reshuffle prompted by Mrs Leadsom's resignation, Mel Stride, who had been Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has replaced her as Commons leader. He has been replaced on the Treasury team by Jesse Norman, whose previous role as a transport minister has been filled by Michael Ellis. Rebecca Pow has been made a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, replacing Mr Ellis. On Wednesday, members of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 Committee held a secret ballot on whether to change party rules, to allow the prime minister to face a vote of no confidence immediately. Mrs May is due to meet the chairman of the committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. The results, in sealed envelopes, will be opened if Mrs May does not agree to stand down by 10 June. Mrs May survived ano-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in December.Under existing rules, she cannot be challenged again until December this year.

Sackings possible over maternity problems,"The panel will oversee maternity improvements as well as looking back at cases up to potentially 10 years The man leading an independent panel to oversee maternity improvements at two hospitals has said he would recommend leadership changes if needed. Mick Giannasi admitted adamning reviewinto care in Cwm Taf health board was a ""hard read"" and ""shocking"". AMs have questioned health board chiefs, whoadmitted the experiences of families ""came as a complete shock"". The panel could end up looking at cases of poor care, some involving baby deaths, going back 10 years. Mr Giannasi was appointed by the health minister after maternity services at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil were put in special measures last month. He promised the panel would be ""robust"" and challenge the health board as it brings in improvements. The review by two royal colleges found services were ""under extreme pressure"" and ""dysfunctional,"" while mothers had distressing experiences in how they were treated. ""It's one of the most hard-hitting reports I've ever read - and I've been in public service for 43 years,"" said former police chief Mr Giannasi, in his first interview since his appointment. ""It's very difficult to read those things if you're passionate about public service and the NHS, as I am. The most difficult part was reading the words of the families, their stories and the impact on their lives. ""The expectation is you will treat people with dignity, respect, care and compassion - when you see that hasn't happened, that's the hard bit for me."" Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless 'Dysfunctional' maternity services put in special measures Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity services Oversee improvements in maternity services - to ensure plans are robust and properly scrutinised Review cases over a potential 10 years - the 43 cases highlighted by the initial inquiry (2016-18) and then looking at the previous six years and possibly a further two years To engage with mothers and families to ensure their voices are heard. Progress will also be shared with them every three months, at the same time as the minister, before they are made public Compile lessons for Cwm Taf and maternity services elsewhere Four senior Cwm Taf executives - including chief executive Allison Williams and chairman Prof Marcus Longley - werequestioned by the assembly's health committee. Prof Longley told AMs: ""It's very important, I think, that the team who understands these problems and knew intimately now what needs to be done about them are charged with responsibility of getting on with it now. ""To have a change of leadership at this point will only result in hesitation and delay and that I'm sure is something nobody wants."" Asked if he might recommend changes in senior positions, Mr Giannasi said:  ""If I have good reason, with evidence, to suggest that a particular course of action is appropriate, then I'll refer that back to ministers and the health board - that's part of my terms of reference. ""Just to be clear, there are circumstances when a change of personnel is absolutely the right thing to do but not always. There's clear evidence from other places that simply changing the leadership or bringing new people in does not necessarily solve the problem. ""Sometimes the best people to solve the problem are those who were there when it was created. And if that's the case I'll work with those people - if I don't think that's the case I'll have no hesitation in saying so."" Mick Giannasi cannot yet say how many historic cases will eventually be looked at but promises a thorough job with clinical expertise brought in Aged 59, from Stoke-on-Trent, with more than 30 years service in policing in the Staffordshire, Merseyside and Gwent forces Chief constable of Gwent (2008-2011) and deputy chief (2005) Chairman of the Welsh Ambulance Service (2013-2018) Commissioner on the panel to oversee Anglesey council improvements (2011-2013) Awarded a CBE and Queen's Police Medal A core of 50 of the 200 families involved in the initial review want to be closely involved in the panel's work, while others want to be kept informed. It is likely to involve many more families - there were 67 stillbirths back to 2010 indentified in the report - but estimates are not currently possible until the panel gets to work. ""There are people who are upset, people who are asking very serious questions, people who want answers - so we have to find a way of meeting the needs of those individual people,"" he added. Mr Giannasi said it was important that Cwm Taf continued to make improvements but the panel's work would not go on forever. ""My intention is that the right changes will be made in the shortest possible timescales,"" he said. Cwm Taf health board previously responded to the report by saying that it had already been planning changes and since March, specialist neonatal care was now only provided on one site - Prince Charles Hospital. The Royal Glamorgan still has a midwife-led unit for less complicated births. The health board was renamed Cwm Taf Morgannwg at the start of April, when it also became responsible for services in the Bridgend area.

The undercover migrantThe young man from Ghana who exposed human trafficking after selling his chickens to buy spy glasses.," By Joel GunterBBC Africa Eye It was close to midnight when the young man crawled into the desert. All around him was darkness. A hundred metres away, a handful of Tuareg rebels and people smugglers, who worked together ferrying migrants through this unforgiving stretch of the Sahara, were gathered around three trucks, drumming and dancing and letting off long bursts of gunfire that rattled the night sky. He could just make out the faint light from their phones, and every fifth bullet they fired was a tracer that lit a bright arc towards the stars. The young man, who had given himself the name Azeteng, was somewhere in northern Mali near to the border with Algeria. Behind him lay El-Khalil, a bleak and brutal waystation on the West African migrant route to Europe. Ahead of him, sand stretched for miles in every direction. He was a speck on the dark sea of the Sahara. Slowly, painfully, he pushed his body on, trying to keep as low as possible to the ground. Azeteng was on the run. A few hours earlier, the smugglers who controlled El-Khalil had swiped his glasses from his face, just to mess with him, and refused to give them back. Azeteng was 25 but he was small for his age — 5’ 5” and slightly built, with a shy manner and a way of moving through the world that suggested he was always trying not to be seen. He was powerless to stand up for himself, so he backed away. If the smugglers had stopped then to look closely at his glasses, they might have seen the strangely thick frame, the mini-USB port under one arm, the pin-sized hole in the hinge — and they would surely have killed him. He had seen enough already to be sure. The month was May 2017. The migrant routes through northern Mali were controlled by the Tuareg rebels, who worked with smuggling and trafficking networks connected to departure points across West Africa. Azeteng’s journey began in Ghana. Others came from Guinea, the Gambia, Senegal, Sierra Leone. In recent years, tens of thousands of men, women and children made their way into the Sahara, drawn by the distant promise of a better life in Europe. A Ghanaian migrant who set out in 2016 told me he turned back in fear after hitting the desert. His friends persevered, towards Libya, he said. “Only one succeeded, to Italy. Later he told us that the rest were dead.” Those who attempt the desert crossing travel along ancient trans-Saharan trade routes through Mali and Niger to Algeria and Libya and on to the sea. News reports have focused on the grim toll of the Mediterranean, which claimed the lives of more than 5,000 migrants the year before Azeteng set out. But according to UN estimates, as many as twice the number of migrants died in the desert. A few weeks after Azeteng crawled out of El-Khalil, 44 Ghanaians and Nigerians, including young children, died of thirst in Niger when the smugglers who brought them that far ran out of fuel. Weeks later, at least 50 migrants died when three trucks were abandoned for unknown reasons. Those were the headlines. Many more would die uncounted in the sand. Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Outside El-Khalil, Azeteng prayed. For now, at least, the smugglers seemed too preoccupied with partying to notice the young migrant crawling in the sand, or pay much attention to the strange pair of glasses he had been wearing. When Azeteng thought he was far enough away to be safe, he stood up, brushed the sand from his clothes, and walked into the desert. Azeteng was a middle child but an odd one out. Of his seven siblings, he was the only one with a different mother. He grew up on a rural police barracks in northern Ghana with his father, step-mother, and three half-sisters in two rooms. His own mother lived in central Ghana, and when Azeteng’s father was away, which was often, Azeteng felt like a stranger in his own home. He was supposed to follow his father into the police, but Azeteng dreamed of being a spy. He spent his pocket money on James Bond films and low-budget CIA thrillers, burned on to blank DVDs by traders at the local market. On the weekends, when his father sent him to cut grass for the family’s livestock in a garden behind the police station, Azeteng would pretend he was on a mission, and tiptoe to the door to listen in. What he heard on those weekends killed off what little ambition he had to join the police. He heard poor women come to the office to report that their husbands had beaten them, only to be told they would have to pay for a pen to take their statement, or for petrol to drive to make arrests. The tricks were cheap, and the sums pitifully small, but they had an outsized impact on young Azeteng. When he saw prisoners whipped with sticks in their cells, he knew for sure he would not be a policeman after all. As a teenager, Azeteng carried a pocket radio everywhere. His whirring, detail-driven mind catalogued the world around him, sometimes struggling to discern which details were important and which were not. He wanted to fight against injustice, but he didn’t know how. After high school he went to work with his mother in the fields of Kintampo, and at night he listened to his radio and imagined himself as an undercover journalist. He had already reported one story, at his high school. Using a flip phone to secretly film, he exposed a group of teachers who were brewing alcohol on school grounds    and taking money from students for grades, and when the story made the local papers, three teachers, including the headmaster, were sacked or transferred. Lying in bed in Kintampo, after a day's work in the fields, Azeteng dreamed of telling a bigger story, exposing bigger crimes. On the radio, the news bulletins said young people from Africa were dying in their thousands in the desert and the sea. Six months later, Azeteng boarded a bus to Abeka Lapaz in the west of Accra, where he walked along the side of the nine-lane George W Bush Highway until he reached a nondescript two-storey building, home to CSIT Limited — purveyors of computer products and technical solutions, including secret cameras. He had already done some research into the various types of secret camera available. There was the button, the pen, the clock, the watch, and the glasses. At 200 cedis — about £30 — the glasses were the cheapest. They were capable of recording only low-resolution images and they worked poorly at night. Later, British police would have to examine the footage carefully as they pieced together Azeteng’s story. But as he looked at himself in the mirror that day, Azeteng was just pleased to see it would take a second, third, probably fourth glance to spot that anything was amiss. He bought them, and called them his secret spectacles. For five months, while he saved, Azeteng practised filming and hiding the memory cards in his mouth — a trick from a spy film. Then he sold his livestock — two sheep, six goats and 10 chickens — and set a date to leave. At this point, no-one knew about Azeteng’s wildly dangerous idea except for Azeteng. So he told his priest: he intended to get himself smuggled on the desert migrant route to Europe, using a secret camera in his glasses to document the crimes of the smugglers. The priest asked him if he had considered the dangers involved. Azeteng said he had. “I thought it was a service to the world, a service to restore human dignity,” the priest told me later. “I said I would offer Mass for him while he was away.” Next Azeteng told his father, who now lives in a stone house on a small plot outside Accra. He still has the bearing of a policeman, though slightly faded by retirement, and he still rears livestock, which roamed the plot while we sat inside, away from the fierce afternoon sun. “I was mad, mad because I couldn’t understand why he wants to take that risk,” he said. “Sincerely, I did not give him my blessing. Then he called to say that he had taken off, and I said, well, that is his choice. God be with you.” Azeteng had packed a few items of clothing and made a razor cut in the lining of his rucksack to hide his cash. Then he walked to Kinbu Junction, a teeming transport hub in downtown Accra, and asked three young men if they were going north. They said yes, they were headed for Europe — across the water to Italy or Spain. They gave Azeteng the number for a smuggler named Sulemana. Sulemana told Azeteng to board an ordinary bus to Bamako, the capital of Mali, where they would meet. Azeteng had taught himself to record phone conversations, and he recorded his conversation with Sulemana and took detailed notes. The bus pulled out of Kinbu Junction. Azeteng wrote in his diary: “Saturday, April 15, 2017 — depart for Mali. 9.15am GMT.” The bus crossed into Burkina Faso and then Mali, via checkpoints where small amounts of money were extorted by the police. After three days they reached Bamako. Sulemana arranged a fake travel vaccination certificate for Azeteng and demanded 45,000 CFA — £60 — for the next stage of his trip up to Gao, where Azeteng would meet Sulemana’s boss, Moussa Sangare. At the bus station, somewhere close to a thousand migrants milled around in the heat. Azeteng took out his diary. “Every five minutes a bus will set off with African migrants and those trafficked,” he wrote. “It is more like a busy international airport.” He wrote down a detailed description of Sulemana and the smuggler's phone number, then he boarded the bus. After a few hours on the road, Sulemana called him. “If anyone asks you where you are going, tell them you are going to visit your relative,” he said. “Do not tell them you are going to Europe through the desert.” Sulemana told Azeteng to prepare for his cash to run out, and to have to call home to ask for more along the way. “It is like I told you,” he said. “The road is all about money.” After two days, the bus arrived in Gao — the gateway to the Sahara. Gao is a city of hot dust-red streets and mud-brick houses, where migrants flow hourly into the city’s main bus station. Many, like Azeteng, already have a phone number of one of the city’s connection men, who house migrants for a few days before selling them on to be taken across the desert. Anyone without a name and number is a target for coaxers — young men who board the buses outside the city to hustle migrants for their smuggling bosses. Azeteng knew to ask for Moussa Sangare and soon he was in Sangare’s ghetto house. He moved through the house discreetly taking photographs with his flip phone and writing down what he saw. Moussa Sangare appeared to take money from Malian security officers. He paid the connection men and boys who worked for him. When he had a certain number of migrants, he transferred them to the Tuaregs for the drive across the desert. Everything in his house — food, drinking water, a bath — cost money. After three nights in Gao, Azeteng was called up to pay the $400 fee to continue north. Here was the final moment of safety before the dangers of the open desert. Ahead of the migrants lay at least six days in the Sahara, but in all likelihood many more. EU-funded patrols were targeting the smugglers, pushing them to take longer, more remote routes. Trucks, laden with human cargo, became stuck. Migrants were dumped miles from cities and forced to walk, or waylaid for weeks as they worked to pay their way on. Out on the desert, the lines between smugglers and traffickers, victims and perpetrators, would blur. Sand dunes would shift in the wind, leading even seasoned drivers astray. But as Azeteng lined up to leave Gao, few seemed to dwell on the dangers ahead. The crowd buzzed at the imminent departure. In front of them were Toyota Hilux pick-up trucks which would ferry them to a warehouse to board larger, ageing transport trucks. Azeteng was packed into a truck with about 75 others — all men save for two Nigerian women, who sat up front with the driver. Azeteng sat on the floor at the back of the second truck, his knees close to his chest, filming with his phone. Somebody switched on a small bluetooth speaker and the migrants sang and danced to pop music. Different languages and dialects rang out over the din — French, Bambara, Mandingo, Twi. As the convoy hit the open desert, excitement rippled through the truck. But the migrants were headed into northern Mali, a lawless black spot bereft of government forces, humanitarian agencies and journalists; controlled by militias and beset by jihadists. Azeteng sat quietly, a knot tightening in his stomach. It was night when the trucks came to an abrupt stop, jolting Azeteng from a half-sleep. Voices called out from the dark, ordering the migrants to get out, and they were surrounded by men in military fatigues carrying AK-47s. They had hit the first Tuareg rebel checkpoint. The rebels fired shots into the air and ordered the migrants to line up to pay. Those who didn’t have enough money were told to form a separate line and had their pockets searched and possessions taken. Then they were beaten. Azeteng was hit hard in the side of the head, knocking his glasses off his face. A migrant in front of him was hit with a metal pole and bled from the mouth. A Gambian man, who Azeteng had befriended on the journey, held up his Koran and begged in vain for them to stop. Azeteng put his glasses back on and, overcoming a swell of fear, pressed the tiny button under the arm. The grainy footage captured the migrants shuffling past a militant holding out a large plastic bowl, depositing cash. When the bowl was full, another militant tipped it into a larger bowl. Those who had paid were ordered to sit on the sand and wait. The wind whipped up and the cold began to bite. It was then that Azeteng saw the two Nigerian women again, the women who had sat up front with the driver. Women from Nigeria, more than any other African nation, have fallen prey to the sex-trafficking trade to Europe. A well-established criminal network entraps them with promises of well-paid jobs as hairdressers or houseworkers or similar, then sells them into sex work. “As soon as they leave their family and community network they become extremely vulnerable,” Michele Bombassei, a UN expert on West African migration, told me. “And this is the moment the sexual exploitation begins.” Azeteng had spoken to the Nigerian women briefly, back in Bamako. They were confident and outgoing. They had joked and laughed. Now their heads were bowed, and Azeteng watched as they walked silently into the desert escorted by seven armed men from the checkpoint. The seven men gang-raped the two women on the desert floor, close enough that the migrants could see. When it was finished, the women were brought back and put in the front of the truck and the migrants were put in the back of the truck, and a heavy silence settled on them. The jubilation of earlier that day had given way to fear. No-one stood or danced or even spoke. Azeteng craned his neck and looked up at the stars, and they drove on through the night and the next morning and in the merciless heat of the afternoon they approached the second checkpoint. It was the crack of a rifle bullet brought them to a stop a second time — a warning shot that fizzed over their heads. Azeteng picked himself up from the bed of the truck and looked out and a chill ran through him. For the first time in his life, he saw a severed human head. Two severed human heads, mounted on wooden stakes — young men like him, he thought, probably migrants who made some small mistake. Horseflies buzzed around the heads, and blood had run down the wooden stakes and dried. The migrants were ordered to get down from the trucks and line up, and the grim events of the first checkpoint began to repeat themselves — the cash bowl, the beatings, the Nigerian women. Azeteng watched as the women walked again into the desert with half a dozen men. The migrants waited nearby, and the driver of the truck, who looked to be in his late 30s and wore traditional Muslim dress, and had shared the front cabin with the women, took a handful of sticks from a stash under the truck and slowly he made a fire. He filled a metal pot with water and poured in tea leaves and brought it to the boil. Darkness began to settle. The driver stirred the mixture for a while, and when he saw that the women were being brought back he poured the tea for them, and the three sat silently together by the small fire. The women’s faces looked so blank, Azeteng thought. Then the smugglers came shouting and rounded the migrants up. The trucks drove through the night, and the following morning brought more rebel checkpoints. At the fourth and final, Azeteng was hit in the leg with a metal pole so hard that he crumpled to the ground. The migrants spent that night on the sand, and the Nigerian women were taken away to an area where the smugglers slept, shielded by a canopy from view. When Azeteng awoke, a Senegalese migrant who was sleeping next to him — a tall, slim man in his 20s, who Azeteng liked because he laughed and played music and told loud stories about life in Senegal — said his arm itched. There was a small mark that had begun to swell. The migrants found a scorpion nearby and crushed it. In the truck, the Senegalese migrant scratched the sting and began to complain of chest pains and a headache. Every few minutes he asked for water and the migrants gave freely from their bottles. At the next stop, the border town of El-Khalil, the Senegalese migrant died later on the floor in a small room, surrounded by other migrants. The smugglers wrapped him in a white sheet and buried him in an unmarked grave in the sand. Azeteng wrote in his diary. “In the desert there are no friends and no family, and only God stands as your friend. There is no water, no food and no trees. The desert looks like the sea, and the sun is unbearable.” El-Khalil sits on the border of Mali and Algeria, a frontier trading post that began life in the early 1990s as an arms depot and evolved into an emporium for all manner of illegal trade — cigarettes, petrol, drugs, humans. Its mud-brick buildings are still bullet-scarred by a 2013 battle for control between Tuareg rebels and local Arab militia. Burned out trucks rest in the sand around its perimeter. Azeteng and the rest of the migrants were told to hand over any ID documents then packed into small rooms and made to stay inside. They survived on biscuits and water, which was always hot from sitting in the sun in plastic drums. The fee to cross to Algeria was $100. Azeteng offered to do chores for the smugglers in order to be near them. He ferried water and hung washing, and filmed them as they phoned migrants families to demand money transfers. A humming generator powered chargers that kept the collection of phones alive, and the smugglers laughed and listened to music as they demanded $100 through Orange Money transfer or Western Union. Azeteng wrote down the names, dates, and bank account numbers, and added them to his growing collection. He was taking an incomprehensible risk. A week after he arrived, four migrants who couldn’t raise enough money escaped in the night, setting off to walk the 16km (10 miles) to the first town over the border. The smugglers chased them down and brought them back — two alive, two dead. The migrants were rustled out of their rooms to watch as a smuggler pulled the bodies off the back of a pick-up truck. “This is what happens to whoever tries to run,” the smuggler said. From Azeteng's footage: people smugglers in El-Khalil, who call migrants' families and demand money transfers to secure the migrants' safe passage As well as spying on the smugglers, Azeteng turned his lens on migrants and locals. His footage and his diary became a catalogue of dreams, regrets, horror and humour on the road. “The road is not good,” said Daniel, a Guinean migrant who had been travelling with Azeteng since Gao. “The rebels ask you for money and if you do not have it they will tie you like a dangerous dog and put you in the sun. ""My god, my god, my god, this is very dangerous,” he said. “If you cannot pay the money you will never leave the desert.” A woman who sold food to the smugglers from a small storefront told Azeteng a long and funny story about a love affair with a Liberian army officer who smuggled cocaine through El Khalil, and she railed about men in general. “Their brains only work at night,” she sighed. Azeteng spent a little over two weeks in El-Khalil, until one afternoon he walked outside blinking into the sun, and was about to put on his glasses when he caught the eyes of a few idle smugglers, who beckoned him over. Just as he had practiced, Azeteng took the tiny memory card out of his glasses and put it discreetly into his mouth. A smuggler snatched the glasses and tried them on and laughed. Panic rose in Azeteng’s throat. Making too much of a scene would draw attention to the glasses, he thought, so he backed away, and in the dark of an outhouse, with the door wedged shut, he weighed his options. They killed migrants who tried to run. What would they do to a migrant spy? They tie you like a dangerous dog and put you in the sun. The words of the Guinean migrant rang in his head. You will never leave the desert. Azeteng waited in the outhouse until after nightfall, until he heard the sound of the smugglers drumming and the pah pah pah of their AK-47s firing into the sky. He knew he had to escape. Before he left the outhouse, he moved his memory card from inside his cheek on to his tongue, and swallowed. Then he went to his room to grab his few remaining things — a diary, a pair of trousers and a T-shirt, assorted notes and bus tickets, and a one-litre bottle of warm brackish water — and crawled out on to the sand. That night, in the desert, his mind drifted in the dark. He heard voices at his back, but when he turned he saw only sand. What is this, he thought. Are these ghosts? Are these the voices of the migrants who have died on the desert? Is someone going to take my soul?Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. His fear was compounded by a growing anxiety about losing his film footage — footage that was now in his stomach. He took the bottle of water from his knotted pullover and drank it in one go. Then he pushed his fingers down his throat until he vomited out the memory card, which he cleaned with his T-shirt and pushed into the pocket of his trousers. The first stop inside Algeria was Bordj Badji Mokhtar, about 15km across the desert as the crow flies but 26km if you follow the road that cuts through the sand. Azeteng walked slowly in what he hoped was the direction of Bordj. He had no water and he stopped often to rest. Eventually, the sun rose, and in the distance Azeteng saw cars passing intermittently on the road. When an Algerian army truck passed he thought he was saved, but it only slowed enough for the soldiers to throw a bottle of water at him and laugh as they sped off. A second truck carrying ice stopped and the driver gave him ice, but wouldn't take him. A third truck stopped and the driver gave him bread. For the first time on his journey, he became truly convinced he would lose his life. Finally, a fourth truck stopped, and a tradesman agreed to take him to Bordj. He didn’t speak English and Azeteng didn’t speak Arabic. Silently they rode north. Azeteng had been sustained by a fantasy borrowed from a movie — an undercover migrant on a mission to document the crimes of the smugglers. But by the time he entered Bordj, he had no papers, no money and no spy glasses, and the story he’d told himself began to unravel. He stayed with scores of others in an apartment where migrants slept in every available space, and the smell of camel meat drifted in day and night from the restaurant next door. A few days after he arrived, Algerian children threw stones at him and called him a “black migrant”. He wept in the street. He would need to work in Bordj in order to earn his way onwards, and he set about doing construction — mixing concrete, plastering, tiling. Sitting on the street one day, Azeteng saw Sekou, a young Guinean migrant he recognised from El-Khalil. Sekou was limping and bleeding from the nose and mouth. He had been severely beaten by the smugglers in El-Khalil, he said, and dumped in the desert 8km from Bordj. Azeteng helped Sekou to a hospital. Four days later, Sekou was dead. Some smugglers collected the body, and Azeteng followed them to a migrants’ graveyard near the edge of town. He watched as they took Sekou’s body from the bed of a pick-up. The dead man had been wrapped in a white sheet, one arm bound straight along his side and the other folded across his chest. They lowered the body into a shallow grave and covered it with sand and gravel and bricks. Adjacent to the migrants’ graveyard was a graveyard for Algerian citizens, with orderly plots and headstones. The migrants were buried haphazardly and close together, with nothing to mark their passing but the disturbance of the earth. Azeteng began to count, first one by one, then in rough batches, and by the time he gave up he’d counted 700 graves. Azeteng went straight from the graveyard to where Sekou’s few belongings had been left and he picked out the dead man’s ID. In the picture, Sekou had closely cropped hair and a sharp, handsome face. The details on the ID card were plain. Sex: Male. Nationality: Guinea. Profession: Trader. Year of birth: 1996. Azeteng put the ID card in his pocket. He needed to keep moving. It was early June, and the smugglers said there would be cars leaving in five days for Algiers — a three day, 1,500km journey across the desert. Azeteng went to an internet cafe, copied his memory cards on to a computer and emailed himself the footage. Then he wiped the files from the hard drive, like he’d seen in films, and prepared to leave. Three days later he was crammed with 14 other migrants — two for each seat — into a Toyota Land Cruiser. Azeteng could not move enough even to look left or right or raise a water bottle to his lips. They were heading into an arid stretch of the Sahara that in the height of summer is among the hottest places on earth. After about 10km, the cars paused so the driver could scan for Algerian army trucks from a steep dune, and the migrants stretched their legs. The desert looked like a rolling sea, Azeteng thought. His teeth were sore and turning brown and he had given up trying to rub the sand from his hair. His limbs ached, particularly his leg, where a deep purple bruise had flowered. The driver returned and the migrants were crammed again into the Land Cruiser and they set off, and after 100km they were transferred to a minibus for the long, largely featureless desert ride to Algiers. Around the time Azeteng was crossing Algeria, the country was breaking in a new policy of aggressive migrant deportations that would see thousands of people dumped in the desert over the following year. Sub-Saharan Africans were rounded up en masse — from the street, from construction sites, from their homes — and deposited in an empty stretch of desert called Point Zero. According to Human Rights Watch, men, women and young children were forced, some at gunpoint, to walk up to 30km through the blistering desert heat until they reached the nearest town. Ahmed Ouyahia, then Algeria’s cabinet chief, said that African migrants were a “source of criminality and drugs”. In reality, they were mostly a source of low- or unpaid labour on construction sites from Bordj to Algiers. Dozens of migrants who flowed back from Algeria through Niger in early 2018 reported being sold by traffickers into slavery. Ibrahim Musah, a Ghanaian migrant who followed the same route as Azeteng, five months earlier, told me he was bussed directly to a Turkish-run construction site in Algiers to register, then to a compound where West African migrants slept on cots in temporary cabins, which is where he met Azeteng one day in June, and became the first person Azeteng told on his journey about his secret filming. “He was doing a good thing,” Ibrahim told me. “But if the smugglers see you filming they will kill you. They will kill you,” he said. The pair became friends. Ibrahim started out from Ghana with almost no money, and he was subjected to levels of hardship and brutality that Azeteng had paid to avoid. Locked into debt bondage, he worked for five months in Mali and Algeria with little or no pay. “It is so hard, so hard,” he said. “Work, work, work, work, work.” He pinched a fold of his skin. “My body was not good, it changed because of no food.” Ibrahim walked for five days in the desert after he and others were dumped by the smugglers, he said. He saw hands and feet sticking out of the sand, and helped bury a man who sat down on a dune one day, closed his eyes, and died. dfvsad Days passed on the construction site in Algiers. Azeteng and Ibrahim were barely paid or fed, and raids by Algerian security forces became more frequent. When Ibrahim heard the Algerians were dumping migrants in the desert, he made his way to a UN camp in Niger and was repatriated to Ghana. Azeteng left the site and spent a few nights on the streets in Algiers, then he did something he hoped he would never do — he begged. He was largely ignored or swatted away, until he approached a 21-year-old Algerian law student called Houssem, who became the second person Azeteng told on his journey about his secret spectacles. “I always remember his face, he was in a bad situation,” Houssem told me. “He was tired and confused.” The two sat and spoke for a while, about racism, migration, life in Africa. Houssem asked Azeteng how much he thought it would cost him to get back to Ghana. He drove Azeteng via his house to the bus stop, and gave him 35,000 dinars — £220 — for the journey home, and told him to stay in touch, and he never asked for the money back. “I did what my heart told me to do,” Houssem said. “That's all.” Azeteng boarded the bus and began the long journey home, via Mali and Burkina Faso, by smuggling routes and ordinary bus journeys, and in the early hours of 2 July he passed the Ghanaian border, and made the sign of the cross. Neil Abbott is the only officer of the British National Crime Agency based in Accra. His job is to help local law enforcement agencies police major crimes, like drug smuggling, modern slavery and human trafficking. In August 2017, Abbott was at a conference in Accra at the UN migration agency, the IOM, when an employee told him about a package that had appeared in their mailroom — a crazy story about a migrant spy. Back at the NCA offices, Abbott paid a visit to the mailroom and found a brown paper envelope, hand delivered. “It was undercover recordings, photographs, interviews with potential offenders and potential victims,” Abbott told me. “He’d collected all this information, bus tickets, travel itinerary… He had leaflets about agencies and transport depots, he’d marked phone numbers, names, bank account numbers…” After he’d got back to Ghana, Azeteng had compiled copies of his evidence into packets and delivered them to various UN offices and the UK, US and Ghanaian embassies. Then he waited, and he had almost given up hope when he got two calls in a week, one from the British and one from the Americans. At the end of his long journey, Azeteng found himself, to his surprise, in a secure compound inside the British High Commission, on a leafy street in an upmarket part of Accra, telling his story to the UK National Crime Agency. I met Abbott there in February, and asked him what he made of Azeteng’s journey. “As a law enforcement officer, clearly there’s a story there for us, and potentially a witness to crimes that we can do something about,” he said. Abbott and a colleague debriefed Azeteng over three weeks, carefully going over his story and physical evidence. Azeteng excitedly met every question with detail after detail. He drew maps and copied out names, locations, and the number plates of trucks. He produced strange artefacts from his journey — a camel bone from his walk through the night, a coin from the pocket of a migrant who died. Then, three months later, in February 2018, Azeteng got a call asking him to come back to the NCA offices. They told him that parts of his evidence had been sent to law enforcement in Mali and used in operations in Gao that resulted in the arrests of suspected people-smugglers. “I can't go into who those people are, the specifics of it, because there are ongoing investigations and we don't want to prejudice any prosecutions that may happen in the future,” Abbott told me. “However, proactive action was taken within countries such as Mali that resulted in positive outcomes for that country.” The technical language masked something that meant the world to Azeteng — his journey had not been in vain. He had gone undercover, and contributed in some way to fighting crimes against migrants. He was elated. But Abbott told him something else too: that his journey had been foolish and reckless, and that he could just as easily have lost his life. “He’s one young man on this epic journey and he’s put his life on the line,” Abbott told me. “Make no bones about it, the journey these victims go on, and they are victims — they start off thinking they’re going to get a better life and halfway through they run out of money and end up being trafficked, and they are in the hands of these merciless people. “These stories happen daily,” he said. “I'm sure it's happening as we speak.” I visited Azeteng in February, at his home in a small town just outside Accra, where he lives in a single room in a stone and clay-soil hut that encompasses two rooms, of which the other is a sheep coop. The building sits on the edge of a communal space with a rough dirt floor, overhung by washing lines and populated by meandering livestock, in a slum-like settlement built along the side of a rail track that runs through the town on a low gravel berm. In a box in the corner of the room, Azeteng keeps all the bits and pieces he collected on his journey — bus tickets, pictures, memory cards, a fake vaccination certificate and more. One item still bothers him, and he takes it out occasionally to look at. When Azeteng got back to Ghana, he went to the Guinean embassy and told them he needed help to find the family of a Guinean man who had died on the desert. “I have his ID card,” he told the ambassador’s assistant. “Name: Sekou. Sex: Male. Nationality: Guinea. Profession: Trader. Year of birth: 1996.” Azeteng waited for three hours, until the assistant told him the embassy could not help and ushered him out. I asked him why he took Sekou’s ID in the first place. “That is someone’s son, someone’s brother, who knows, maybe even someone’s father,” he said. “I asked myself, how will his family know that he is dead? So I am trying my best for the family to be aware.” In Kumasi, 200km to the north, Azeteng's friend Ibrahim was finishing work for the day. His repatriation from Algeria to Ghana had transplanted him from one construction site to another. The wages were better but the work was patchy, and he was not earning nearly enough to support his family. Then there was the shame of coming home at all, he said, of not having sent any money from Europe. “I tried. I tried, I tried, I tried,” he said, softly. “But I failed.” It may be that the full effects of the recent wave of African migration towards Europe are not felt for years to come. Azeteng told me his story with care and attention and in meticulous detail, until, several times, he broke down in tears. “What I have seen with my eyes is not easy,” he said. Of the tens of thousands who have died on the journey, most stories will never fully be known, even to their families. For some who return, the ordeal will continue, in the form of stigma for a perceived failure to provide. It is a generational trauma. As the sun fell, we walked from Azeteng’s settlement through sandy backroads to a church for evening mass, led by the same priest he had confided in before he left. After the Eucharist had been administered and the tithe collected, and the parishioners had finished singing, the small congregation filed out into the night. There was a perfectly clear sky, and Azeteng lingered under the stars to wait for the priest. “When I was walking alone in the desert, you could see the moon just like this,” he said quietly. “I saw an aeroplane overhead and its lights were blinking, and I prayed that it would fall and pick me up and rescue me.” I asked him what he would say to someone considering the journey to Europe. “You will never find greener pastures on the desert,” he said. The priest emerged from the church and Azeteng thanked him for the sermon. Then he set off walking back in the direction of his room. He was saving up again, he said, but this time for a diploma in journalism. In a felt pouch in his pocket were his new secret spectacles. In his bag was Sekou’s ID.

Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions'The competition regulator says that four drugs firms forced the price of an anti-nausea tablet up by 700%.Business,"Prochlorperazine is prescribed for nausea and dizziness Four pharmaceutical firms have been accused of illegally colluding to restrict the supply of an anti-nausea tablet, driving the price paid for it by the NHS up by 700%. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the cost of prochlorperazine rose from Â£6.49 per pack to Â£51.68, after suppliers agreed not to compete. The drug is often prescribed to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. One of the firms named, Alliance Pharma, denied the allegations. In a statement of objections,,externalthe CMA says that between 2013 and 2018, the annual cost of 3mg dissolvable prochlorperazine tablets increased from approximately Â£2.7m to Â£7.5m, even though the NHS dispensed fewer packs during that period. It claimed that sharp increase was the result of four companies - Alliance Pharma, Focus, Lexon and Medreich - agreeing not to compete against each other for the supply of the prescription-only pills. Alliance supplied prochlorperazine exclusively to Focus, which the CMA says then paid Lexon a share of its profits from the sales. Lexon, the competition regulator alleges, then shared these payments with Medreich. Chemotherapy patients are often prescribed prochlorperazine to help with dizziness The CMA alleges that, before entering into this arrangement, Lexon and Medreich had been planning to launch their own jointly-developed prochlorperazine. In a statement, Alliance said it had ""no involvement in the pricing or distribution of prochlorperazine since 2013, when it was out-licensed by the company to Focus Pharmaceuticals Limited on an exclusive basis as is normal market practice"". The firm added: ""Alliance has not had control of or influence on, and nor has it benefited from, any price increases."" The BBC has contacted Focus, Lexon and Medreich for comment. The CMA's Ann Pope said: ""Agreements where a company pays a rival not to enter the market can lead to higher prices and deprive the NHS of huge savings that often result from competition between drug suppliers. ""The NHS should not be denied the opportunity of benefitting from an increased choice of suppliers, or lower prices, for important medicine."" The companies concerned will now have the opportunity to respond to the CMA's provisional findings. If it eventually determines that competition law has been broken, the CMA can impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of each company's worldwide turnover.

Modi takes clear lead in epic India poll,"This video can not be played BJP supporters celebrate as their party looks set to win a clear majority in parliament Indian PM Narendra Modi has secured another five-year term after winning a landslide general election victory.

Up to 50 patients 'stuck in secure units',"St Andrew's Healthcare chief executive Katie Fisher said the causes of delays were complex Up to 50 patients, some with learning disabilities and autism who should be released, are stuck in secure units run by a mental health hospital charity. St Andrew's Healthcare, which treats up to 900 patients, told the BBC there was a lack of suitable community places. Footage of a teenager locked in seclusion, able to touch their parent only through a door hatch at one of its units, has been shown to the BBC. The hospital said seclusion was used as an emergency response only. St Andrew's Healthcare runs four private hospitals that specialise in caring for patients with severe mental health and learning difficulties - 90% of referrals are from the NHS. Patients are supposed to be admitted to these assessment and treatment units (ATUs) for nine to 18 months but the average stay nationally is five years. Chief executive Katie Fisher told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme one patient had been detained for an extra 524 days after they should have been released. ""It varies over time and of course the reasons for delays are complex,"" she said. ""This isn't someone sitting on something, who isn't doing their job properly. ""Maybe several attempts have been made to create a discharge and for several reasons that has fallen through."" Last month,the programme reported that one St Andrew's Healthcare patient, Ayla Haines26, had tried to kill herself after spending seven years in an ATU. Following this, Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, announced an all-party parliamentary group to investigate mental health hospitals. On Monday,research by the children's commissioner for England found too many childrenwere being admitted to mental health hospitals unnecessarily - despite a government pledge to move up to 50% of such patients into community settings by March 2019. Ms Fisher said continuing to detain patients who no longer needed to be in ATUs was unacceptable, ""But actually, people's mental health and wellbeing can fluctuate over time, so it's not as simple as just saying someone needs to be here and someone doesn't need to be here."" One patient could have contact with their parent only through a hatch in a door Hospitals use a seclusion room as a last resort if a patient is in extreme distress or is a risk to themselves or a member of staff. In a damning report published this week, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) called for a review of every patient in long-term seclusion or segregation in mental health hospitals across the UK. The Victoria Derbyshire programme was given footage of a teenager reaching their arm through a door hatch to enable contact with their parents during a visit to a St Andrew's hospital. The parent told the programme the patient had been held in seclusion for months. A recent CQC inspection of St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton found one patient had had repeated and prolonged periods of seclusion over 18 months. The hospital said it would not comment on individual cases. But Ms Fisher said: ""In some seclusion rooms for certain types of patients, there is the opportunity to for food and other things that patient might need to be given to them through an opening of the door, which means the door itself doesn't have to be opened. ""The use of seclusion rooms is only ever used as an emergency response and if all other efforts of de-escalation, both verbal and low-stimulation rooms, have failed."" Psychiatrist Paul Wallang says prone restraint should not be used Another CQC inspection report, published in 2016, found a technique called prone - or face-down - restraint was being used widely across wards at the St Andrew's hospitals. Its use has reduced - but there were still more than 1,000 recorded incidents last year. Between 2016 and 2018, prone restraint was used by staff on patients 5,597 times. This is despite a consultant psychiatrist at St Andrews telling the Victoria Derbyshire programme prone restraint should not be used. ""It is something that is associated with death in some circumstances - certainly within the charity, we have reduced the amount of prone restraint that we use drastically over many years,"" said Paul Wallang. But he added: ""Sometimes when somebody is restrained they will move into the restraint position in a prone. ""If that happens, we immediately move them to supine, which is face-up, a much safer way to restrain - and all of our staff are trained in that technique."" A government spokeswoman said: ""The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020. ""And through the [NHS] Long Term Plan, we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay. ""The CQC is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.""

How do MEPs get elected?,"Seats in the European Parliament representing England, Scotland and Wales are distributed according to the D'Hondt system, a type of proportional representation. The nations are divided into 11 electoral regions: nine in England, plus Scotland and Wales. For this election, Gibraltar votes as part of a combined constituency with the south-west of England. Parties vying for election submit a list of candidates to voters in each region. A system devised by Victor D'Hondt, a Belgian lawyer and mathematician active in the 19th Century, dictates the results: In the first round of counting the party with the most votes wins a seat for the candidate at the top of its list In the second round the winning party's vote is divided by two, and whichever party comes out on top in the re-ordered results wins a seat for their top candidate The process repeats itself, with the original vote of the winning party in each round being divided by one plus their running total of MEPs, until all the seats for the region have been taken By way of example, here are the results for one region of England, the West Midlands, in 2014, which had a total of seven seats in the European Parliament up for grabs. For simplicity's sake, only the five largest parties by vote share are included: UKIP wins the largest number of votes and the candidate at the top of their list is elected. As UKIP already has one candidate elected, its vote is divided by two (one, plus the number of MEPs it has). Now, Labour comes out on top and the candidate at the top of its list of candidates is elected. After Labour's vote is divided by two (one plus the number of MEPs it has), the Conservative Party wins and its top candidate for the region is also elected. After the Conservative vote has been divided by two, UKIP is back on top. The candidate in second place on its list is elected. Since two UKIP candidates have now been elected, their original vote tally is divided by three (one plus the number of MEPs elected) and Labour secures top spot and a second MEP for the region. The original Labour vote is now divided by three (one plus the two MEPs from round five), leaving the Conservative Party to top this round and win a seat for the second person on its list. The Conservative Party vote is now divided by three, leaving UKIP in first place to win the final seat for the third candidate on its list. In Northern Ireland,a different systemis used to elect its three MEPs. Voters have a ""single transferable vote"", meaning that they are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. They take the total number of valid votes cast, divide it by the number of seats available plus one, and then add one. In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota, they are elected. Surplus votes, ie those received above the quota, are redistributed among the other candidates. If not enough candidates have yet reached the quota, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated, and the lower-preference votes of their supporters are again re-allocated. This process is repeated until the three posts have been filled. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"BJP takes early lead in epic India pollAs votes are counted, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party is leading, early results show.India","This video can not be played BJP supporters celebrate as their party looks set to win a clear majority in parliament Indian PM Narendra Modi has secured another five-year term after winning a landslide general election victory. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to win about 300 of the 543 seats in parliament, in what Mr Modi hailed as ""a historic mandate"". The main opposition alliance, which is headed by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, has admitted defeat. The vote had been widely viewed as a referendum on the prime minister's Hindu nationalist politics. ""We all want a new India. I want to bow down my head and say thank you,"" Mr Modi said in a victory address to BJP supporters on Thursday evening. What is Modi's record in office? Modi reinvents Indian politics The Hindu foot soldier who became PM India election - as it happened More than 600 million people voted in a marathon six-week process. Mr Modi has not just exceeded exit poll predictions but has also won a larger share of the vote than the 2014 elections, partial results show. Many viewed the election as a referendum on Mr Modi (L) who won a landslide in 2014 At a press conference in Delhi, Mr Gandhi conceded the general election as well as his Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh, which he had held since 2004 and his family had held for decades. Partial and declared results show Mr Modi's BJP is projected to win 300 seats on its own, and combined with the party's allies, this number reaches nearly 350. The main opposition Congress party is expected to win fewer than 60. A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. Live results,external A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election Modi: The man who wants 900m votes 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls In 2014, the BJP won 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years - and with its allies it secured 336 seats in that parliament. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat in 2014 and with its allies took up just 60 seats in the lower house. This video can not be played If you havenât been paying much attention, hereâs what you've missed This year 900 million voters were eligible to take part in seven rounds of voting, making it the largest election the world has ever seen. The final result may not be known for several hours or longer. Narendra Modi made this an election all about himself. He should have faced some anti-incumbent feeling. Joblessness has risen to a record high, farm incomes have plummeted and industrial production has slumped. Many Indians were hit hard by the currency ban (also known as demonetisation), which was designed to flush out undeclared wealth, and there were complaints about what critics said was a poorly designed and complicated uniform sales tax. The results prove that people are not yet blaming Mr Modi for this. A combination of nationalist rhetoric, subtle religious polarisation and a slew of welfare programmes helped Mr Modi to coast to a second successive win. He also mined national security as a vote-getter in a manner never seen in a general election in recent history. ""It is all right if there's little development, but Modi is keeping the nation secure and keeping India's head high,"" a voter in the eastern city of Kolkata told me. Mr Modi is a strongman, and people possibly love him for that. Modi reinvents Indian politics ""This election was fought not by politicians but the people of this country - but it's the people of this country who have emerged victorious,"" Mr Modi told thousands of supporters at the BJP's headquarters in Delhi. ""We will never give up our ideals, our humility and our culture,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Party members cheered, banged drums and set off fireworks when the results started to emerge. As the prime minister arrived, he was showered with rose petals. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, a senior BJP leader, said in a tweet thatthe BJP had won a ""massive victory"",external. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulated Mr Modi for his victory on Twitter,external, and said he looked forward to working with him for ""peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia"". The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Delhi says Congress Party staff, who had been hoping for a much improved performance, looked lost for words. Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka had been hoping to improve on a dismal Congress performance last time The BJP alliance is projected to win more than 50% of the vote in the huge northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends more MPs to parliament than any other state (80). This took election observers by surprise as the party was expected to be seriously challenged by a tie-up between two powerful regional parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), which had previously been bitter rivals. Echoes of Trump in Modi's border politics PM Narendra Modi's Tamil Nadu problem How sugar influences the world's biggest vote The BJP is doing better than expected in West Bengal, where it is projected to take 17 parliamentary seats - up from two in the last polls. Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP and appear to have done so again in this election. They look set to take just three of the 91 seats up for grabs. In this part of the country, the party contests few seats, relying instead on alliances with regional heavyweights. In his victory speech, Mr Modi said there were only two castes in India now. ""The poor and those who want to work to bring them out of poverty. We need to empower both."" Growing unemployment and fears of a recession will see Mr Modi face demands to provide jobs for the millions of young people entering the labour market in coming months. Under his first term, India's economy - the world's sixth largest - lost some of its momentum. A leaked government report this year put the unemployment rate at the highest it's been since the 1970s. Farmers in India will also be hoping he will prioritise the agricultural industry, after a crop glut and declining commodity prices saw their incomes stagnate. India has seen huge protests by farmers in recent years Many saw this election as a battle for India's identity and the protection of minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynching of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. And national security was put into the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting it to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of war.

Fifa drops plan to expand 2022 World CupPlans to expand the 2022 World Cup from 32 teams to 48 are abandoned by football's world governing body Fifa.BBC SportComments,"France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia Plans to expand the 2022 World Cup to 48 teams have been abandoned by Fifa. Fifa president Gianni Infantinosaid last yearthe expansion from 32 teams could be brought forward from 2026 to the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The change would have required Qatar to share hosting duties with other countries in the region. World football's governing body said after a ""thorough and comprehensive consultation process"" the change ""could not be made now"". Fifa also said it explored the possibility of Qatar hosting a 48-team tournament on its own but has decided not to pursue those plans as there was not enough time ""for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact"". In a statement, Qatari World Cup organisers said: ""Qatar had always been open to the idea of an expanded tournament in 2022 had a viable operating model been found and had all parties concluded that an expanded 48-team edition was in the best interest of football and Qatar as the host nation. ""With just three and a half years to go until kick off, Qatar remains as committed as ever to ensuring the 32-team Fifa World Cup in 2022 is one of the best tournaments ever and one that makes the entire Arab world proud."" In November, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said adding 16 teams to Qatar 2022 could create ""many problems"" and described the idea as ""quite unrealistic"". 'A 48-team World Cup makes me want Blatter back' Fifa warned of human rights issues if World Cup expanded US, Canada & Mexico win right to host 2026 World Cup BBC sports editor Dan Roan Those close to the Qatar 2022 organisers say this is a mutual decision that realigns them and Fifa, and that they are now concentrating on delivering the best possible 32-team World Cup. But it will also have come as a major relief to the hosts, who no longer have to worry about sharing football's showpiece event. Perhaps with the Nobel Peace Prize in mind, Fifa president Gianni Infantino had pushed for an expansion against Qatar's wishes, hoping it may help heal diplomatic tensions in the region by staging some games in other countries, but he has now had to admit defeat. With Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all maintaining a blockade of neighbouring Qatar, such an audacious move was never going to be straightforward. The crisis left only Kuwait and Oman as potential co-hosts, but a Fifa study concluded that neither would meet all logistical requirements. Infantino has previously collaborated with Saudi Arabiawhen proposing a revamped Club World Cup, and many suspected this was linked to his suggestion that the country could be part of the solution for an expanded 2022 tournament. But given the condemnation that followed themurder of journalist Jamal Khashoggiat the country's consulate in Istanbul last year, along with its role in Yemen's bloody civil war, such a step would have sparked a major backlash from human rights campaigners, as it would have done if the UAE had been awarded games. So while some national football associations and Infantino will no doubt be disappointed at the news, many others will welcome it. This video can not be played January 2017: Expansion is 21st century move - Infantino In January 2017, Fifa voted unanimously in favour of increasing the World Cup to 48 teams for the 2026 event - which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In October 2018 Infantino said ""we have to see if it is possible"" to bring the expansion forward to 2022. Infantino has been a strong advocate of the expansion and said the World Cup has to be ""more inclusive"". ""We are in the 21st century and we have to shape the World Cup of the 21st century,"" he said when announcing the change. ""It is the future. Football is more than just Europe and South America, football is global."" The expansion in 2026 will see an initial stage of 16 groups of three teams precede a knockout stage for the remaining 32. The number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games. The tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule.

"Avon to be acquired by Natura for ÃÂ£1.6bnThe new combined company will boast 3,200 stores worldwide with a presence in 100 countries.Business","Brazilian cosmetics group Natura has announced that it is buying UK-based direct-selling cosmetics business Avon. Natura, which already owns The Body Shop and Aesop, is Brazil's top business in cosmetics, perfumes and toiletries. Its all-stock offer of about $2bn (Â£1.6bn) means Natura shareholders will hold 76% of the combined company, which will have annual revenue of over $10bn. The deal will create the world's fourth-largest cosmetics company. The new combined company will boast 3,200 stores worldwide with a presence in 100 countries. Is Avon still calling? Avon cuts jobs at UK distribution centre Avon has been struggling to modernise its global business over the last few years, asits door-to-door sales model has become less popularin the internet age. In 2016, the company said it was moving its headquarters from New York to the UK ""over time"" while cutting 2,500 jobs worldwide as part of a turnaround plan. At the same time, Avon sold its US operations to investment fund Cerberus. In April, LG Household & Health Care agreed to acquire both Avon and Cerberus' stakes in the US business. According to analysts at Brasil Plural, Natura is ""pursuing the goal of becoming a global brand"", but warned it would need to significantly invest in Avon's operations in Brazil. Avon already has 2.2 million direct marketing consultants in Brazil. Natura has a similar business model and many Avon representatives in Brazil also sell Natura products too. The Brazilian cosmetics makerpurchased The Body Shopin a deal believed to be worth 1bn euros ($1.1bn; Â£880m) from French beauty group L'Oreal in 2017.

"Trump hits back at Democratic 'cover-up' claimsThe president rules out any bipartisan co-operation until Democrats call off ""phoney investigations"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump to Pelosi: ""I don't do cover-ups"" US President Donald Trump has angrily lashed out at Democratic leaders' claims he is engaged in a ""cover-up"". ""I don't do cover-ups,"" the Republican president said in an unscheduled briefing from the White House. His remarks came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met fellow Democrats to discuss impeaching the president. Mr Trump is fighting congressional inquiries by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents and blocking testimony by current and ex-advisers. Allow Twitter content?

The president spoke minutes after cutting short a planned meeting with the two top Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. The trio were due to discuss spending on ageing US roads and bridges, a rare possible area of agreement between the White House and its political antagonists. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (centre) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (right) speak to the media But Mr Trump abruptly left the discussion with House of Representatives leader Mrs Pelosi and her Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer after barely five minutes. The president then appeared in the Rose Garden to make a surprise statement, condemning ""phoney investigations"" by Democrats. Mr Trump also charged his political opponents with ""abuse"" and railed against their invoking of ""the big i word"" - impeachment. According to CBS News, Mr Trump walked into the meeting with Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer and did not shake either's hand or sit down. An unnamed source familiar with the encounter said Mr Trump upbraided the House speaker for her ""terrible"" allegation earlier in the day about a cover-up. The president demanded Democrats end their investigations against him, or he would not discuss anything else, then abruptly left the room. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Mrs Pelosi did not back down, later specifically mentioning the US constitutional process for removing a president from office. She said at an event in Washington: ""The fact is, in plain sight in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up - and that could be an impeachable offence."" At a press conference earlier with Mrs Pelosi, Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""running away"". ""When we got in the room, the curtains were closed,"" the New York senator said about their brief meeting. ""There was a place for him at the front so he could stand and attempt to tell us why he wouldn't do infrastructure, and of course, then he went to the Rose Garden with prepared signs that had been printed long before our meeting."" After the Mueller investigation concluded, Donald Trump and his advocates cheered what they saw as a cloud over the White House finally lifting. It turns out, however, the political weather is still gloomy. Congressional Democrats have picked up the mantle of the inquiry, issuing a flurry of subpoenas. Now Mr Trump, in what was clearly a pre-planned response, is pushing back. Co-operation and investigation, the president asserts, are mutually exclusive. Hopes of a legislative infrastructure deal have been dashed. Of greater immediate concern, however, is the status of negotiations on approving a new spending plan and raising the debt ceiling. If Republicans in Congress follow the president's lead and dig in their heels, a new round of budget crises could be on the way. An infrastructure plan appeared to be the best way for the president and Democrats to enact substantive legislation that they could take credit for on the 2020 campaign trail. If the current course continues, however, the two sides will instead be fighting over who should shoulder the most blame. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats on Capitol Hill have launched a number of oversight inquiries into Mr Trump, stemming from a special counsel report into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Robert Mueller's investigation did not establish any conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Kremlin, but listed repeated instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. On Wednesday alone, the president's political foes stepped closer towards obtaining his closely guarded accounts. A New York judge ruled that the president's financial records could be provided to Democratic lawmakers by Deutsche Bank and Capital One bank. And New York's Democratic-controlled state legislature approved a bill designed to unseal the president's tax returns, which he has repeatedly prevaricated about disclosing. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that Mr Trump could not block a subpoena ordering his accounting firm to turn over his financial records to Congress. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? On Monday, meanwhile, Mr Trump directed his former White House counsel Don McGahn to ignore a summons to testify to the House Judiciary Committee. The panel responded by issuing subpoenas to two former White House staff members, including ex-communications director Hope Hicks. Eight key findings in the Mueller report As Mr Trump stonewalls congressional investigations, Mrs Pelosi has been trying to tamp down increasing clamour among her fellow Democrats for impeachment proceedings. On Wednesday, she met members of her party in a closed-door session and argued the time was not right for impeaching the president. It was as she emerged from this caucus meeting that Mrs Pelosi angered the president by suggesting to reporters that he was involved in a cover-up. The House leader has also said she believes the president is ""goading"" Democrats into pushing for impeachment. A freshman Democratic congresswoman, Katie Hill,told the Associated Press,externalafter Wednesday's meeting that impeachment was ""becoming an inevitability"" with every act of defiance from the president. Impeachment would need to be approved a majority in the Democratic-controlled House, but it would stand virtually no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. Only two other presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.
