"I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court","Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Wednesday Ryan Giggs' ex-girlfriend has told a court she became ""a slave to his every need and every demand"". The former Manchester United star and ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour and assaulting Kate Greville and her younger sister Emma. During cross-examination, she told Manchester Crown Court: ""He made me feel like I had to do what he said otherwise there were consequences"". He has denied all the charges. Ms Greville agreed she made a number of witness statements to police following the alleged assault in November 2020, including two in the last week. Giggs threw ex out of hotel room naked, court told Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears Chris Daw QC, representing Mr Giggs, asked: ""In the course of those statements, did you tell the police the whole truth?"". She replied: ""100%"". She also rejected claims an argument between the couple in Dubai in September 2017 ""were a complete pack of lies"". Ms Greville has claimed Mr Giggs dragged her naked across the floor of a hotel room and threw her and her belongings into the corridor, bruising her arm in the process. She did not tell anyone at the time about the incident as she was ashamed, and said that text messages in the days afterwards, where she told him ""I love you my gorgeous man"", were genuine. Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against Ms Greville between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of Emma Greville at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. ""It was me being genuine but Ryan had this way of turning everything around on me,"" Ms Greville said. ""I would be made to feel everything was my fault, so I felt I had to overcompensate. ""It's difficult to explain. We had this turbulent relationship. Obviously we had this argument but I desperately wanted this relationship to go back to the way it was. ""I was in denial about actually what had happened. I would never talk to him about it."" She also denied the bruise on her arm was caused by rough sex. Jurors heard a picture message sent to Mr Giggs a few days later read: ""Tan is coming along nicely. My sex bruise is coming along nicely too!!"". The barrister also questioned Ms Greville about her relationship with the former footballer and how they got together. ""I was in a vulnerable position and he played on it,"" she said. Mr Daw asked: ""This was not just two consenting adults, both equally married at the time, who embarked on an affair?"" The witness replied: ""There was a degree of imbalance on my side because of the situation I was in with my ex-husband."" Ms Greville told the court she was not happy and in a ""controlling marriage"", and noticed Mr Giggs was interested in her. She said Mr Giggs used her name a great deal, a technique she had read about from the psychology book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Mr Daw suggested she was implying there was some sort of ""clever psychological game"" in play. He said: ""The impression you give is you only really had an affair with Ryan because you were unhappy and he basically reeled you in?"" Ms Greville replied: ""I'm not saying it was all one-sided. I was fully involved in that. There was things about him that definitely were luring me into a relationship."" Mr Daw said: ""The truth is it's a complete fiction Ryan was using psychological techniques on your vulnerabilities. It's just rubbish?"" But Ms Greville responded saying: ""Absolutely not. I felt like he was using techniques. I was vulnerable, that's a fact. I was in a controlling relationship. That's a fact."" She told the court Mr Giggs' alleged controlling behaviour also affected her friendships and that ""he isolated me from certain people"", adding he also ""interfered with my ability to interact with my family"". Ms Greville told the court violence by Mr Giggs was ""not regular"" and he would use aggression more as a form of control. Mr Daw asked: ""Do you say he undermined your confidence, your self-esteem and was disparaging to you generally in those ways?"" She said: ""Yes, on the whole he was, but on the other side it was like two extremes. Other times he would give me confidence. ""He was not constantly awful, not constantly horrible. It was hot and cold. Two different people. The result of his behaviour... undermined my self-confidence."" She said he had also undermined and damaged her business. The court heard Ms Greville gave a statement the day before the start of the trial in which she said she had felt like ""a slave"" to the defendant. The court previously heard Ryan Giggs had eight relationships with other women while with Kate Greville She said: ""That is what it felt like. When Ryan said do something, I would do it. ""There was resistance sometimes but he made me feel like I had to do what he said, otherwise there would be consequences."" Ms Greville said she is ""really into psychology"" and during the relationship she Googled what was happening in her relationship. ""The thing that came up was not coercion, there was narcissistic personality disorder,"" she added. ""And what I was experiencing was very similar to that."" She also denied she was looking for compensation when the case ends. Mr Daw asked if for the majority of the time the couple were together, he was kind and loving to her. Ms Greville said: ""To begin with, yes. I would say for four-and-half years he was nice and for a year-and-a-half he was not. Near the end it was much pretty much relentlessly awful."" She said she had noticed a ""significant change"" when she returned to Manchester in January 2018. Around the same time Mr Giggs was applying for the manager's job of the Wales national team but she said it was not the workload which led him to become more distant. ""There was obviously other things going on in his life as well,"" she said. The court also heard the following month Mr Giggs' daughter found out about couple's relationship from a Valentine's card Ms Greville sent while he was still married to his wife Stacey. Ms Greville said: ""He was lying to them, so it was making the situation worse."" In 2019, Mr Giggs is said to have sent an email following a row with the title ""blackmail"" and a video attached. Jurors heard this was sent after Ms Greville blocked Mr Giggs on WhatsApp and he was trying to get her to respond. She told police she suspected the attachment was, ""one of our videos that we had done"" and he was threatening to share it with work colleagues if she did not unblock him and respond to his messages. But Ms Greville said she did not view the attachment and deleted it, saying: ""It could have been something funny, but it could have been a sexual video."" Mr Daw said: ""Mr Giggs would have significant interest in private sexual videos getting into the public domain. You knew full well it was not a sexual video,"" he added claiming she had watched it. The barrister said Mr Giggs had deleted the videos and, when the couple got back together six weeks later, he asked Ms Greville to send them to him again, which she did. Mr Daw asked: ""Did it not cross your mind at some future date that the issue may arise again?"" She replied: ""I thought he had changed and he was in a different place. This was the same cycle of things. He promised he would change."" She said things ""ramped up"" during the first Covid-19 lockdown when they lived together. Ms Greville said the abuse was verbal but became written in messages and emails towards the end of the relationship because ""I was standing up for myself"". The jury previously heard Mr Giggs grabbed her by the shoulders and headbutted her in November 2020 after she earlier confronted him about his alleged serial cheating. She said in the lead-up to the alleged assault, she had learned he had ""full-on relationships"" with eight other women while they were together. The discovery of messages ""going back years"" on his iPad prompted her to decide to leave him, she said. The court heard the police wanted Kate Greville to hand over her phone as part of their investigation but she told them she lost it at the end of last year when it dropped in a river as she ""tried to rescue my dog from the water"". Another phone went missing when she was mugged in Market Street in Manchester city centre which left her ""distraught"", she added. The court heard police told her any data could be retrieved from iCloud but she did not want details of her business revealed. Queried over his line of questioning, Mr Daw told the judge it was ""designed towards the proposition that the witness deliberately withheld information that would undermine the case against Mr Giggs"", which she denied. The trial continues.

Trump refuses to answer questions in New York probe,"Donald Trump arrived at the New York attorney general's office for questioning on Wednesday Former US President Donald Trump has declined to answer questions as part of a New York state investigation into his family's business practices. Mr Trump had sued in an effort to block the interview at the New York attorney general's office on Wednesday. State officials accuse the Trump Organization of misleading authorities about the value of its assets in order to get favourable loans and tax breaks. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing and has called the civil probe a witch hunt. Katty Kay: Will an FBI 'raid' supercharge Trump? Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? An hour after he was pictured arriving at the Manhattan office where he was questioned under oath, Mr Trump released a statement in which he criticised New York Attorney General Letitia James and the broader investigation. ""Years of work and tens of millions of dollars have been spent on this long simmering saga, and to no avail,"" he said. ""I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution."" Ms James' office confirmed that the interview took place on Wednesday and that ""Mr Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination"". ""Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead,"" the statement added. ""Our investigation continues."" His deposition comes just days after the FBI executed an unprecedented search warrant at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, as part of a separate investigation that is reportedly linked to his handling of classified material. While the attorney general's investigation is a civil one, a parallel investigation is being carried out by the Manhattan District Attorney's office which could result in criminal charges. Legal analysts suggest Mr Trump may have declined to answer questions on Wednesday because his answers could have been used against him in that criminal investigation. The former president invoked the Fifth Amendment, which protects people from being compelled to be a witness against themselves in a criminal case. This video can not be played Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The questioning lasted around four hours, and included lengthy breaks, his lawyer Ronald Fischetti told US media. Mr Trump began by reading a statement into the record condemning the attorney general and her investigation and invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. He proceeded to say ""same answer"" to every question he was asked. Ms James' office has said that the depositions - a legal term that means testimony not given in court - were among the last remaining investigative procedures to be carried out. New York Attorney General Letitia James Once the investigation concludes, the state attorney general could decide to bring a lawsuit seeking financial penalties against Mr Trump or his company. Ms James had sought Mr Trump's deposition - and that of two of his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr - for more than six months while the family resisted subpoenas through the New York court system. Lawyers for Mr Trump had also attempted to sue Ms James in a bid to prevent her from questioning the former president and his children. But in February, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that all three must sit for depositions. Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr were questioned earlier this month. The judge said the investigation had uncovered ""copious evidence of possible financial fraud"" giving the attorney general a ""clear right"" to question under oath the former president and two of his children involved in the business. Ms James hailed the judge's decision as a victory, saying that ""justice has prevailed"". The investigation, which was first opened in 2019, seeks to prove that Mr Trump and the Trump Organization misrepresented the value of assets in order to obtain favourable loans and tax breaks. The alleged fraud is said to have taken place before Mr Trump took office. ""The mob takes the Fifth,"" Donald Trump said at an Iowa campaign rally in 2016. His target? You've guessed it - Hillary Clinton. Some of her former staffers had exercised their right to silence during a congressional inquiry. The boot is now on the other foot, as they say. ""I once asked,"" said his statement on Wednesday - published while his deposition by the New York attorney general was still ongoing - ""If you're innocent why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"" ""Now I know the answer to that question,"" he concluded, suggesting that he had been left with no choice. There are parallels here - in terms of Mr Trump's response - with the separate investigation into his handling of official documents, thought to have been the reason for the recent search of his Florida estate. While his allies have been demanding answers from officials over the unprecedented action, he could choose to provide some himself. That's because he'll have a copy of the warrant and the inventory of material removed from his property. Yet his public statements suggest he's been left in the dark, and he has repeatedly attacked the process. His supporters may believe the narrative that he is being persecuted. But - as Trump himself once did - others may see his refusal to answer questions as a sign there's substance to the case against him. Earlier this week, the FBI searched Mr Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago, reportedly in connection with his handling of classified records. A House of Representatives select committee is investigating his actions surrounding the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 - when his supporters rioted at Congress in Washington DC as lawmakers met to certify Mr Biden's election victory The justice department is examining his challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election A prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, is investigating whether Mr Trump and his associates tried to interfere in that state's results from the election A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that lawmakers can gain access to Mr Trump's tax records, affirming the decision of a lower court Read more:How big are Trump's legal problems?

Energy bills could go up before October price rise,"Energy bills could increase ahead of the expected rise in October, the UK's energy regulator has revealed. Ofgem and industry body Energy UK said it was ""possible"" for suppliers to raise customers' direct debits before the new cap on energy prices kicks in. Any rises would be to help spread the cost of higher energy use in the winter months, Ofgem said. Households have been warned of sharp rises in energy prices, with average bills forecast to reach Â£4,200 in 2023. Ofgem said direct debits are usually charged in a way so that customers build up ""credit"" during the warmer summer months when usage is lower, to spread out the cost of using more energy in the colder months. ""It's therefore possible for direct debits to increase ahead of a price cap rise or even when a customer's use has remained constant,"" an Ofgem spokesperson said. However, Ofgem said customers can ask for their excess credit to be ""returned at any time and can contact their suppliers to change how their direct debit is spread"". ""For example, they pay for exactly what they used in that month and do not build up a credit ahead of winter,"" Ofgem said. Ofgem confirmed direct debits could be increased before October, after Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert, told the Today programme that direct debits were going to ""start rising pretty much immediately on the 26 August before the new prime minister's in place"". ""As soon as the announcement is made from Ofgem on the 26 August, that crystallizes the direct debits going up,"" he said. British gas owner Centrica confirmed to the BBC that direct debits could go up before the start of October. ""We constantly review direct debits to help customers who have chosen to spread their payments throughout the year. We contact these customers on an individual basis to advise of any changes.' Octopus Energy said it constantly review direct debits to make sure its customers were paying an ""appropriate amount"" for the energy they use. However, it said it ""wouldn't suggest any changes based on the price cap until the new price cap has come into effect"". ""Even if we do suggest Direct Debit changes - our customers are always completely in control and can get in touch to change them anytime,"" it added. EDF said direct debits were not automatically increased or decreased due to price cap increases or decreases. The company said it reviewed direct debits every six months and made ""any necessary direct debit amount changes, to reflect the latest meter reading received and any changes in their tariff"". However, it added: ""Customers do have the option to increase direct debits themselves, aligning themselves to increases in the price cap."" Eon and Ovo Energy did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. Energy crisis is on scale of pandemic - Martin Lewis Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year Energy UK, the trade body for the energy industry, said direct debits were ""reviewed periodically"" with suppliers taking into account factors including estimated usage, current tariffs, debit/credit balances and recent meter reads. ""It is, therefore, possible some customers' direct debts will change in advance of October,"" a statement said. ""All suppliers must, however, ensure that direct debits are set correctly based on all relevant information available at the time of review, and that they communicate any changes in a way that helps consumers understand their payments for energy."" A new price cap- determining the maximum suppliers can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is due to be announced at the end of this month, but will come into effect in October. Consultants Cornwall Insights expects this to rise to Â£3,582 a year, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine pushing up global wholesale gas prices, and have warned of further rises over the winter. Ofgem said protecting consumers was its ""top priority"", adding ""suppliers must ensure that direct debit payments are based on the best and most current information available to them"".

Student loan interest rate capped at 6.3%,"The interest rate on student loans in England and Wales is to be capped at 6.3% this autumn. It had been due to rise from the current 4.5% to 7.3%, but is being altered to ""align with the most recent data on market rates"" for loans. England's universities minister said she wanted to ""provide support"" amid the rising cost of living. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the change did ""nothing at all to protect current students"". Student loan interest rates will be reviewed again in December. The interest rate on the loan for those currently at university in England and Wales is calculated by adding 3% to the retail price index (RPI) - a measure of inflation which indicates the rate at which prices are rising. The RPI figure confirmed in April set the interest rate for the forthcoming academic year. Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicted the maximum rate on student loanswould jump from 4.5% to 12%from September this year. Subsequently, in June,the government said the rate would be capped at 7.3%to provide ""peace of mind for graduates"". Everything you need to know about student loans Students to pay off loans into their 60s, plans say Announcing the government's latest move, which sets the cap at 6.3%, Universities Minister Andrea Jenkyns said the further reduction in interest rates was intended to offer reassurance to anxious students. ""We understand that many people are worried about the impact of rising prices and we want to reassure people that we are we are stepping up to provide support where we can,"" she added. The Welsh government said it would follow suit. The announcement from the government does not change the amount that borrowers repay each month - it changes the total amount that they owe. Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the IFS, said most graduates' repayments would not be affected by the latest adjustment. ""Only the minority of, mostly high-earning, graduates set to pay off their loans in full will ever actually benefit from this,"" he said - adding that it would reduce a typical student loan balance by about Â£100 this autumn for recent graduates. ""Importantly, this does nothing at all to protect current students from the rising cost of living."" IFS analysis suggests that in the coming academic year, the real-terms value of maximum maintenance loans - for students from the poorest backgrounds -will fall to its lowest level in seven years.,external Commenting on the research, Mr Waltmann said: ""Unless the government changes course, students from the poorest families will be at least Â£100 out of pocket - per month."" For students starting degree courses from 2023,the interest rate will be fixed at a lower level. EASY RECIPES FOR KIDS:Want to get the kids enjoying cooking?

Quarter of Ukraine refugee hosts want to end scheme,"A quarter of sponsors of Ukrainians as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme do not want to continue the arrangement beyond six months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has found. Launched in March, it has seen about 75,000 refugees arrive in the UK. Sponsors agreed to provide accommodation in their own home for a minimum of six months. But there are concerns at what will happen when those arrangements reach the end of that time. The scheme was set up by the government to help those fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and worked alongside the Ukraine Family Scheme - which allowed refugees to join relatives already living in the UK. How many Ukrainian refugees now have UK visas? Refugee help varies 'based on country of origin' UK set to admit lone teenage refugees from Ukraine An ONS survey,externalof Homes for Ukraine hosts found 26% want to end their sponsorship after six months or less. Six out of 10 sponsors said they were happy to accommodate their Ukrainian guests for more than the agreed minimum with almost a quarter saying they would be prepared to continue the arrangement for more than a year. However, almost all sponsors said they had provided support and help to their guests that went beyond the official arrangement. Eight out of 10 said they had given them food, two-thirds had helped them find work and 45% had provided financial support. The ONS research also found that 18% of those signed up for the scheme were still waiting for guests to move in. Of those who did not wish to accommodate Ukrainians for more than six months, just under a quarter said their decision was down to the rising cost of living. Sponsors currently receive Â£350 a month but the survey found four in 10 might be prepared to host for longer if there was more financial help. Maria Divid has been hosting a Ukrainian refugee since April and said she was ""very happy"" to host her guest for another six months. The refugee, a woman from the Ukraine capital Kyiv, lives in Ms Divid's spare room in her London home. ""I'm originally from Russia and was devastated by the conflict, so I was very keen to counteract the consequences of the war in any way I could,"" she told BBC News. She said being a sponsor had led to her bills going up but that was more than covered by the Â£350 she received each month from the government. ""My guest also buys her own food, so the costs are managed. But I can imagine for other households it could be more of an issue,"" she added. Another Londoner, who asked not to be named, took in a single Ukrainian man into the home he shares with his wife.Â But after three months the arrangementÂ broke down. The young man left their home and is now staying in free council housing for the remaining three months that he would have spent with his original hosts.Â His sponsor said they had tried to help their guest settle with lots of chats and loans but it became challenging when he would not claim benefits or meet up with other Ukrainians in the UK. ""ItÂ meant there was a lot of pressure on us, apart from hosting him.""Â The young man also had mental health difficulties and was ""understandably struggling with some issues,"", his sponsor said, but there was no support for ending the scheme. ""What the government are asking from you is to provide a full social security system. As soon as there's any problem or confusion or challenge, there was nowhere to turn or no one to help,"" he added. The ONS surveyed all UK adults registered with the scheme as of 7 July, in collaboration with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), with 17,702 people responding. Recent government figures show 145 placements have ended with Ukrainian refugees finding themselves homeless, 90 because the relationship broke down and 55 where the accommodation was deemed unsuitable before they moved in. ""We see a lot of generosity and goodwill in what hosts report doing for their guests,"" Tim Gibbs, from the ONS, said. ""The majority are still hosting and many indicate a willingness to host beyond the initial six months. ""However, we also see the additional work and expense involved in hosting with some saying more or ongoing support would be welcomed."" Refugees minister Lord Harrington said the vast majority of sponsors wanted to provide support for longer than six months which was a ""testament to the goodwill the British public has shown the people of Ukraine since tanks first rolled across the border"". Sponsors would continue to receive thank you payments for up to 12 months and the government is contacting hosts to outline the next steps and support available, he said. ""We initially asked sponsors to host for a minimum of six months and we are working closely with councils to ensure Ukrainians have a safe place to live if they decide to move on,"" Lord Harrington said. There are concerns from councils about the number of hosts who say they do not want to continue with the scheme, and Local Government Association chairman James Jamieson said they were talking to the government about how they might be encouraged to do so. ""For instance, increasing the thank you payment to a higher amount so the sponsors can be sure it's not costing them,"" he said. ""There is a significant risk - even if re-matching is available - that many Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless because of a lack of sponsors or options.""

Marcus Mumford reveals he was abused aged six,"Marcus Mumford is the lead singer of Mumford & Sons and now also a solo artist Marcus Mumford, the frontman of the band Mumford & Sons, has revealed he was sexually abused as a six-year-old. ""Not by family and not in the church, which might be some people's assumption,"" he toldGQ magazine,external. The 35-year-old singer said he addressed the issue in the lyrics to his recent solo single, Cannibal. ""Like lots of people - and I'm learning more and more about this as we go and as I play it to people - I was sexually abused as a child,"" he said. ""But I hadn't told anyone about it for 30 years."" Mumford, whose parents were international leaders of evangelical Christian denomination the Vineyard Churches, said he had sought therapy after hitting ""rock bottom"" at the end of his band's 2018 tour in support of their latest album, Delta. ""I'd had the people closest to me hold up a mirror and say, like, 'Dude, something's not right here and it's your responsibility to go figure it out,'"" he said. Mumford and Sons rose to fame with hits such as Little Lion Man and I Will Wait and headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2013 In his second session with a therapist, who specialises in trauma, Mumford was physically sick talking about his childhood experiences. ""Apparently, it's very common,"" he noted. ""Once you basically unhook the denial and start the process of removing some suppression, then it's very natural for that stuff to come out. ""I'd had problems breathing all my life - not asthma but just, like, catching my breath."" Mumford described the abuse as ""the first of a string of really unusual, unhealthy sexual experiences at a really early age"". ""And for some reason, and I can't really understand why,"" he said, ""I didn't become a perpetrator of sexual abuse - although, I've done my fair share of [bad] behaviour."" Mumford, who is married to the British actress Carey Mulligan, added he had spent his life until now ""in layers of shame"" he had become ""addicted to"". The lyrics to the aforementioned and deeply personal new track, which will feature on his forthcoming self-titled debut solo album, go as follows: ""I can still taste you and I hate it / That wasn't a choice in the mind of a child and you knew it / You took the first slice of me and you ate it raw / Ripped it in with your teeth and your lips like a cannibal / You [expletive] animal"". Steven Spielberg directedthe video for the song,external, shot in a high-school gym in New York. In the comments sectionunder Mumford's tweet,externalplugging the GQ article, fans thanked him for sharing. ""This article is everything,"" wrote one. ""It's so so we'll written and moving and thought provoking. Thank you."" ""So beautiful,"" wrote another. ""Thank you for sharing this. This will help so many people.""

Decision on new coal mine delayed until November,"The former Marchon chemical works on the outskirts of Whitehaven is the site of the proposed mine A decision on whether to go ahead with a new coal mine in Cumbria has been delayed for a second time. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it would now be made ""on or before 8 November"". The Planning Inspectorate's report has been with the government since Apriland a decision was due in August. If allowed it would be the first deep coal mine to open in the UK for more than 30 years. The department said officials were ""not yet in a position to complete their consideration before providing advice to ministers"". It added: ""This is a quasi-judicial decision so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage."" The proposed mine at Whitehaven would remove coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea for the production of steel in the UK and Europe. The coal would not be used for power generation. A public inquiry was held bythe Planning Inspectorateinto whether West Cumbria Miningcould mine coking coal,externalat the former Marchon chemical works site. Supporters claim it will create jobs and reduce the need to import coal for steelmaking. The Conservative mayor of Copeland Mike Starkie, who has previously said local support for the mine is strong, called the latest delay ""outrageous and totally unacceptable"". ""To now move the goalposts to November is appalling and there is no justification whatsoever."" He said it was a ""dreadful way"" to treat private investors and called on Tory leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak ""to use their influence to bring this to a conclusion"". Opponents of the mine have previously protested outside the Home Office in London as well as at the site in Whitehaven Victoria Marsom, from Friends of the Earth, who have campaigned against the mine said areas like Cumbria should be ""at the heart of building the greener future we need"". ""The UK and European market for coking coal is set to rapidly diminish as manufacturers switch to greener steel, while coal from this mine won't replace Russian imports,"" she added. ""However, this new mine will increase carbon emissions, with the government's climate watchdog describing it as 'absolutely indefensible'."" The original deadline for the decision was 7 July, and it is believed the Prime Minister Boris Johnson was scheduled to be in Cumbria on that day. However, in a twist of fate, it was the same day Mr Johnson announced he was to stand down as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister. A second deadline for a decision was set for 17 August but that too has now been pushed back - potentially until after a new prime minister is announced on 5 September. The mine was approved to operate until 2049 by Cumbria County Council in October 2020, butjust four months later the authority suspended its decision. West Cumbria Mining previously said exploratory works led it to estimate there were about 750m tonnes of ""excellent quality"" coking coal in the area. However, planning conditions would limit the company to producing no more than 2.78m tonnes a year. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC,"Supermarkets are not cutting fuel prices by as much as they should do to match the ""significant"" drop in the cost of wholesale fuel, the RAC has said. The motoring group said the gap between pump prices and wholesale prices was the widest in almost a decade. The price of petrol on Tuesday was about Â£1.76 per litre, but RAC analysts suggested it should be about Â£1.62. Fuel prices have hit record highs this year, but are slowly starting to fall. The RAC said at the start of the week, the average petrol price at the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, was Â£1.74 per litre. Diesel was Â£1.86. Meanwhile the average for the delivered wholesale petrol price last week was Â£1.24, while diesel was Â£1.38. After factoring in VAT, fuel duty and a ""generous"" retailer margin of 10p per litre, the RAC said ""forecourts should soon be selling unleaded for no more than Â£1.62"". Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? ""There appears to have been a big shift in the last few months in the behaviour of the four major supermarkets, which dominate UK fuel retailing, as they are now commonly being undercut by independent retailers that are passing on the wholesale cost savings they're benefitting from to drivers at the pumps,"" said Simon Williams, RAC's fuel spokesman. ""This is unheard of as the supermarkets are normally at least 3p a litre cheaper than the UK average."" The reason supermarkets are usually cheaper than independent retailers is because they buy fuel more frequently meaning they can react quickly when wholesale prices move up or down. Mr Williams said that was ""often demonstrated by the speed at which they pass on increases on their forecourts when wholesale prices rise"". ""As the supermarkets account for so much of all the fuel sold across the country and they haven't lowered their prices as much as they should have, it means average UK prices have not come down in line with the significant drop in wholesale fuel,"" he added. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons have been contacted for comment. The gap between retail and wholesale prices, excluding VAT, is the widest since the RAC started monitoring them in 2013. The RAC said the current gap exceeded the difference between wholesale and retail prices at the start of the pandemic, when the country went into lockdown, and the price of oil plunged to about $13 a barrel. Oil has been consistently at around $100 per barrel in recent months. Fuel prices were already rising before the war in Ukraine started in February, but the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but is facing sanctions as a result of its actions in Ukraine. This has pushed up demand for oil from other producers, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Petrol and diesel prices usually move when the price of crude oil goes up or down. In mid-June, the RAC revealed petrol prices hit new record highs every day for a month, which led to the average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up. Why are petrol prices going back up?

'I've been let down - I shouldn't have stage-4 cancer',"Caroline Boulton has been told nothing can be done for her cancer now A woman with fast-growing stage-four breast cancer says the NHS has let her down, with delays at every stage of her treatment. Caroline Boulton, 56, had several appointments for a mammogram, which checks for early signs of cancer, cancelled because of Covid, in March and November 2020. In late 2021, she found a small lump, went to her GP and was referred urgently to a specialist - but then the delays began. ""They haven't moved quickly enough,"" Ms Boulton says, who lives in Greater Manchester. ""It's been really, really slow."" ""Between each appointment, each scan, there's been four-, five-, six-, seven-, eight-week waiting times and delays every time."" The referral letter came through ""very quickly"" but then she waited three weeks, instead of the recommended two, to see a consultant. ""When I first found the lump, it was only pea-sized,"" Ms Boulton says. ""By the time I got to see the consultant, it was the size of a tangerine."" Her cancer was growing quickly, she was told, but it would be eight weeks before a mastectomy could be scheduled to remove her breast. ""Considering it was fast-growing, that's a huge concern - you're living with that, waiting, knowing it's growing,"" Ms Boulton says. When she finally saw an oncologist seven months after finding the lump, had another scan and received the results, the cancer had spread to her liver - and there was no longer any treatment they could offer. ""I've now got stage-four cancer that I shouldn't have - and two years to live."" The oncologist told her she had 30 lesions on her liver and said: ""There's nothing - nothing we can do for you."" Two years had passed from the date of her first cancelled mammogram to finding out the devastating news. Ms Boulton had to tell her partner Wendy that her cancer had spread to her liver and was now incurable Figures leaked to the Health Service Journal and seen by BBC Newsnight: 327,395 people are on England's cancer waiting list nearly 40,000 have been waiting more than 62 days after a GP referral for suspected cancer the number waiting more than 104 days, has doubled since June 2021, to over 10,000 During the pandemic, cancer screening, treatment and operations were cancelled to free up staff and hospital beds, creating long waits for care and causing patients huge anxiety. The record numbers now coming forward with cancer symptoms means cancers are being caught earlier than before - but it's creating enormous demand, NHS England says. ""We have written to local NHS services making clear that reducing cancer waits is a key priority, helping them redesign their care to meet the increased demand as well as investing billions in extra diagnostic and treatment capacity across the country,"" it added. But leading oncologist Prof Pat Price, from Imperial College London, says: ""This is the worst cancer crisis of my lifetime. ""The waits for cancer treatment are the worst they've ever been - and they're getting worse. ""We have to get on and address this crisis. This is an absolute disaster.""

Ministers to meet energy giants over cost of living,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic Ministers will hold talks with energy giants on Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. The government says talks will focus on how energy companies can alleviate pressure on consumers. But Treasury officials have stressed that any big decisions will be decided by the next prime minister, when they take office in early September. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he would make sure options and ideas were in place for the new PM. Concerns over what will happen this winter come as figures suggest many households are already in energy debt. Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak said he would be ""happy"" to meet his rival Liz Truss to agree emergency support ahead of the winter. Ms Truss has dismissed the proposal telling reporters ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". Yet new figures from comparison service Uswitch laid bare the challenge facing Mr Johnson's successor. Unclaimed: Are you missing out on any universal credit? How high will my energy bill go? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 to energy firms, on average, with the total debt owed by the public triple that of September last year,according to a survey of 2,000 households. Forecasts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January - while the state pension is typically worth between Â£7,376 and Â£9,628. Mr Johnson has faced growing criticism for not announcing further support beyond the Â£15bn package set out in May, while the government is under pressure to do more to help with bills. Mr Zahawi said he was focused on ensuring that the money the government had already promised was getting ""into people's bank accounts"". He added that he would make sure ""we have the ideas and the options available to whoever becomes prime minister on the 5 September"". But consumer expert Martin Lewishas called on,externalwhat he described as the ""zombie"" government to ""wake up"" and put together a plan immediately. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the current situation to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are currently in that position of watching the beds in European hospitals and doing nothing about it,"" he said. On Wednesday morning, Ms Truss did not rule out making cash payments to help people with energy bills but said her priority would be to reverse April's National Insurance rise and temporarily drop green levies on energy bills arguing that low taxes were ""vitally important"" for growing the economy. She also said she would boost energy supply by ""getting more gas out of the North Sea"" and allowing more fracking to take place. Analysis by Rajdeep Sandhu, BBC political correspondent Liz Truss is trying to appeal to two different electorates at the same time. The first and arguably most important (right now) is the Conservative membership. Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister. But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs. That might explain why Liz Truss's language has been very careful in recent days. Because while she is convinced tax cuts are the way to help the economy grow, she isn't categorically ruling out direct support to those who are vulnerable. She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become prime minister and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. The Liberal Democratshave arguedthat the energy profits levy - or windfall tax - should be backdated to October 2021 and the extra money raised should be used to help people with energy bills. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Companies supplying energy are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic, but more recently because of supply constraints following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thelevy- which the Treasury previously said could raise up to Â£5bn - came into effect on 26 May. Energy firms like BP have reported recorded quarterly profits this year that will not be impacted by the levy. Asked about backdating the windfall tax, Ms Truss replied: ""The answer to our problems is not more taxes."" Speaking at a leadership hustings, former Chancellor Mr Sunak warned that the Conservative Party would be ""hammered"" at the next election without offering further direct support to households. This video can not be played Labour's Bridget Philipson says the party has been ""consistently ahead of the government"" on energy bills He has not set out in detail what further payments he would make to households, saying the exact scale of the rise is still unclear, and any payments would come on top of existing support. Labour's shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast the situation was ""deeply worrying"" and said Labour would cut VAT on gas and electricity bills. She also said her party would set out further proposals ""very soon"" but added that they ""wouldn't have let things get to this point in the first place"".

Energy crisis is on scale of pandemic - Martin Lewis,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic The situation with energy bills is ""a national crisis"" on the scale of the Covid pandemic, Martin Lewis has said. The consumer expert told the BBC support needed to double tomake up for the huge expected risein bills. The government said it had ""continually taken action to help households"". It comes as a survey by comparison site Uswitch suggested many people are already behind on energy bill payments with total debt owed three times higher than in September last year. Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 on average, according to the survey of 2,000 people. Uswitch advised people falling into debt to speak to their provider to work out a more affordable payment plan. The figures come a day after consultancy Cornwall Insight warned energy bills couldrise much higher than previously thoughtin October. Cornwall also expects bills to increase much more sharply in January, with the average household paying Â£355 a month, instead of the current Â£164 a month. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Mr Lewis said according to forecasts, the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - would effectively double between May of this year and October. The latest price cap is due to be announced at the end of this month by the energy regulator Ofgem. In May the government announced a package of support, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for more than eight million low-income households. But Mr Lewis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If [the chancellor] is going to be consistent, he will need to double every number in that package."" Ministers are set tohold talks with energy giantson Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. However, Mr Lewis said ultimately it was ""government alone"" which could help by putting ""more money into people's pockets"". The boss of Octopus Energy also said he thought the government needed to improve its offer of Â£400 for households to help with rising energy bills. Greg Jackson told the BBC that while the initial package of support may have been ""right"" at the time, ""clearly it's not sufficient now and we need to look at a similarly significant assistance from the government for this winter"". Derek Lickorish, chairman of energy supplier Utilita, called for a social tariff, which offers discounted rates for lower income households, to be introduced. He also said the government needed to ""dramatically"" increase support by Â£800 - Â£1,000 per household. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the Treasury had been preparing ""options"" for the next prime minister on what further support could be offered. However, Treasury officials have stressed that any decisions on major fiscal issues will be decided after the new PM takes office. Leadership frontrunner Liz Truss rejected the idea of holding talks with Boris Johnson and her rival Rishi Sunak before the end of the contest, saying ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". She denied she was ruling out payments to help with energy bills. However, stressing her support for tax cuts, Ms Truss said her priority was ""making sure we're not taking money off people and then giving it back to them later on"". James has had to take out a loan to cover his family's energy bill James Gilmour, who lives with his partner and three children in Essex, has taken out a Â£5,000 loan to help cover his energy bills when they go up in October. His gas and electricity bill has already doubled from Â£145 per month to Â£320 a month and from October he said he will be paying more than Â£600 per month, according to the latest forecasts. ""As a family of five we simply cannot afford to pay this monthly as we are already getting half way into the month with no money left for food and essentials,"" he told the BBC. James, who works in the automotive industry, said the loan was ""the only way to survive through this crisis"". Read more here. There are two main reasons households end up in debt to their supplier: the first reason, their direct debit payments may be set too low to cover the amount of energy being used. Anyone who finds themselves in that position should contact their supplier as quickly as possible to avoid a sudden bill shock, and give it their correct meter readings. The second reason is because people are just not keeping up with their payments. The Uswitch survey revealed that in addition to the group in debt, eight million households have no credit balances, meaning they have no cushion against the bill rises this winter. ""This is an alarming situation, as summer is traditionally a time when households are using less power for heating, which helps bill payers to build up energy credit ahead of the winter,"" said Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at Uswitch.com. An Ofgem spokesperson said its ""priority"" is to ""protect consumers"" and make sure suppliers treat their customers in a ""fair and reasonable manner"". A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We know the pressures people are facing with rising costs, which is why we have continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year."" Separately on Wednesday, E.On reported first-half profits of just under â¬4.1bn (Â£3.5bn), which was about â¬700m below the previous year. The company, which is one of the UK's biggest energy suppliers, described the energy crisis as ""extraordinary"", and said it highlighted the need for Europe ""to transform its energy system. To be independent of Russian gas. To ensure supply security"". It is worth saying again that the old advice to shop around to find a better energy deal just does not apply anymore. The default price cap, although super high, is the best rate available at the moment, so don't be pushed into signing up for a new fixed deal unless you want to, as you may end up paying more in the long-run. If you are falling behind on your energy payments, or are unable to keep-up with the increases in direct debits being suggested by your supplier, then the first thing to do is let them know you're struggling. Making that call might be tough, as it's never easy to admit you're finding things difficult, however it's likely to be the best protection for your household this winter. Taking action is important because there is an extra layer of legal help available for people who are unable to pay, which forces suppliers to work through lots of different options with their customers. That includes agreeing a payment plan, giving temporary credit for prepayment customers, and arranging for payment directly through benefits. Crucially, making that call to explain that you're struggling means they can't just cut you off. 'I'm borrowing Â£5,000 to pay my energy bills' What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?

Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister.

per month, up from Â£480. ""That was in October 2021, six months before the energy
price cap increase. On 24 September, our electricity standing charge will
increase by 818% per day,"" she tells the BBC, urging the government to
take action to support small business owners. She says many businesses like hers can't risk passing on the price rise to
customers, who could go elsewhere. ""The general public think it's all over now Covid restrictions have been
dropped, but we feel like the fight is only just getting started,"" she

Payments will begin in Great Britain in October, but there is uncertainty as to how the money can be distributed to people in Northern Ireland because of the current absence of the devolved government at Stormont.

more than 25% due to rising oil prices and strong wage growth.Inflation was then brought largely under control
for the next few decades, despite some rises since 2008 related to the global
financial crisis and more recently the Covid pandemic. Last week, the Bank of England predicted that the cost of living could increase by more than 13% in the coming months, with high energy prices one of the
main reasons behind the rise. In addition to increased energy bills, consumers are also
having to deal with rising fuel prices. 
Although costs have dropped slightly from the record highs seen at the
beginning of July, current prices are still significantly higher than they were
at the start of the year. Michael RaceBusiness reporter Supermarkets are not cutting fuel prices by as much as they should to match the ""significant"" drop in the cost of wholesale fuel, the motoring group RAC says. It says the gap between pump prices and wholesale prices was the widest in almost a decade. The price of petrol on Tuesday was aboutÂ£1.76per litre, but RAC analysts suggested that after factoring in VAT, fuel duty and the ""generous"" retailer margin of 10p per litre, the price should be no more thanÂ£1.62. Fuel prices have hit record highs this year, but are slowly starting to fall. Energy customer Dallas Lucas has been speaking to the BBC,
saying the rise in energy prices has left her destitute. ""Right now Iâm sitting on a mattress in my flat, because I don't have a
bed or any furniture. I have been literally living on cereal and water, or
looking through bins for food. ""I've sold all my furniture. I don't have a washer or a
cooker anymore, just to try and keep up with the energy bills,"" she says. Dallas added that her gas bill had increased five-fold in recent
months, from Â£30 per month to Â£150. ""Bear in mind this is when we've had this massive heatwave, and my gas
hasn't been on."" She accused the government of ""playing Russian Roulette"" with people's
lives, adding it was ""soul-destroying"" to hear Boris Johnson saying
it was down to his successor to tackle the issue. Let's take a closer look at reports that the government's plans for this winter's energy crisis include a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" which would see organised blackouts for firms and households. Earlier, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson, said he thinks households are ""safe"" from possible blackouts. Despite the ""terrible price crisis"", he said the UK had a more ""resilient supply"" than other countries in Europe. ""I think the reality is that domestic supply is safe and that industry - from time to time, sometimes driven by prices by the way - voluntarily reduce their energy usage,"" he told BBC Radio 4. Reasonable worst-case scenarios are used by the government to make sure it can respond to more extreme situations - they aren't forecasts about what will happen. There has been more blue-on-blue action, with
the foreign secretary's team saying the former chancellor had ""never""
made a tax cut and again compared him to Gordon Brown, who served as a Labour
chancellor and then PM. A spokesperson for Liz Truss' campaign said: ""Rishi
Sunak wouldnât know how people benefit from a tax cut because he has never cut
a tax in his life. ""People didnât vote for the Conservative
Party to be subjected to old fashioned Gordon Brown- style politics of envy. ""You cannot tax your way to growth and Liz's
agenda is to build a high wage, high growth, low tax economy that supports
people. Liz believes in people keeping more of their own money, not Rishiâs
socialist tax and spend which will lead us to recession."" We've been looking at the rising cost of living - and energy prices in
particular. Citizens Advice says it's helped more than 47,000 people with
energy debts so far this year. Here's a look at what's happened so far today:  Meanwhile the two candidates vying to be the next prime minister have
been setting out how they'd tackle rising energy costs: Chancellor Nadhim
Zahawi and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng are to hold talks with energy
giants tomorrow to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. The chancellor says the Treasury is preparing
ideas and options to help with the cost of living crisis for the next prime
minister to consider. Nadhim Zahawi says we have to ""make sure we have the ideas and
the options available to whoever becomes prime minister on 5 September"". He added the UK government had already allocated
Â£37billion, and he would be focusing on how to ""get it into people's
accounts"".

""pay-as-you-go"" system so she pays for her energy for the day or

now doubled. And it is not just energy she is worrying about, with a water bill of

you know, everybody's in the same situation,"" she says. ""I just find it really upsetting."" Paige has previously had to ""postpone payments by a couple of
weeks"" because of the timing of her pay day. ""It's

Trump refuses to answer questions in New York probeState officials are investigating whether the Trump Organisation misled lenders and tax authorities.,"Donald Trump arrived at the New York attorney general's office for questioning on Wednesday Former US President Donald Trump has declined to answer questions as part of a New York state investigation into his family's business practices. Mr Trump had sued in an effort to block the interview at the New York attorney general's office on Wednesday. State officials accuse the Trump Organization of misleading authorities about the value of its assets in order to get favourable loans and tax breaks. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing and has called the civil probe a witch hunt. Katty Kay: Will an FBI 'raid' supercharge Trump? Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? An hour after he was pictured arriving at the Manhattan office where he was questioned under oath, Mr Trump released a statement in which he criticised New York Attorney General Letitia James and the broader investigation. ""Years of work and tens of millions of dollars have been spent on this long simmering saga, and to no avail,"" he said. ""I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution."" Ms James' office confirmed that the interview took place on Wednesday and that ""Mr Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination"". ""Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead,"" the statement added. ""Our investigation continues."" His deposition comes just days after the FBI executed an unprecedented search warrant at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, as part of a separate investigation that is reportedly linked to his handling of classified material. While the attorney general's investigation is a civil one, a parallel investigation is being carried out by the Manhattan District Attorney's office which could result in criminal charges. Legal analysts suggest Mr Trump may have declined to answer questions on Wednesday because his answers could have been used against him in that criminal investigation. The former president invoked the Fifth Amendment, which protects people from being compelled to be a witness against themselves in a criminal case. This video can not be played Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The questioning lasted around four hours, and included lengthy breaks, his lawyer Ronald Fischetti told US media. Mr Trump began by reading a statement into the record condemning the attorney general and her investigation and invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. He proceeded to say ""same answer"" to every question he was asked. Ms James' office has said that the depositions - a legal term that means testimony not given in court - were among the last remaining investigative procedures to be carried out. New York Attorney General Letitia James Once the investigation concludes, the state attorney general could decide to bring a lawsuit seeking financial penalties against Mr Trump or his company. Ms James had sought Mr Trump's deposition - and that of two of his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr - for more than six months while the family resisted subpoenas through the New York court system. Lawyers for Mr Trump had also attempted to sue Ms James in a bid to prevent her from questioning the former president and his children. But in February, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that all three must sit for depositions. Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr were questioned earlier this month. The judge said the investigation had uncovered ""copious evidence of possible financial fraud"" giving the attorney general a ""clear right"" to question under oath the former president and two of his children involved in the business. Ms James hailed the judge's decision as a victory, saying that ""justice has prevailed"". The investigation, which was first opened in 2019, seeks to prove that Mr Trump and the Trump Organization misrepresented the value of assets in order to obtain favourable loans and tax breaks. The alleged fraud is said to have taken place before Mr Trump took office. ""The mob takes the Fifth,"" Donald Trump said at an Iowa campaign rally in 2016. His target? You've guessed it - Hillary Clinton. Some of her former staffers had exercised their right to silence during a congressional inquiry. The boot is now on the other foot, as they say. ""I once asked,"" said his statement on Wednesday - published while his deposition by the New York attorney general was still ongoing - ""If you're innocent why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"" ""Now I know the answer to that question,"" he concluded, suggesting that he had been left with no choice. There are parallels here - in terms of Mr Trump's response - with the separate investigation into his handling of official documents, thought to have been the reason for the recent search of his Florida estate. While his allies have been demanding answers from officials over the unprecedented action, he could choose to provide some himself. That's because he'll have a copy of the warrant and the inventory of material removed from his property. Yet his public statements suggest he's been left in the dark, and he has repeatedly attacked the process. His supporters may believe the narrative that he is being persecuted. But - as Trump himself once did - others may see his refusal to answer questions as a sign there's substance to the case against him. Earlier this week, the FBI searched Mr Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago, reportedly in connection with his handling of classified records. A House of Representatives select committee is investigating his actions surrounding the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 - when his supporters rioted at Congress in Washington DC as lawmakers met to certify Mr Biden's election victory The justice department is examining his challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election A prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, is investigating whether Mr Trump and his associates tried to interfere in that state's results from the election A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that lawmakers can gain access to Mr Trump's tax records, affirming the decision of a lower court Read more:How big are Trump's legal problems?

""Now I know the answer to that question,"" he concluded, suggesting that he had been left with no choice. There are parallels here - in terms of Mr Trump's response - with the separate investigation into his handling of official documents, thought to have been the reason for the recent search of his Florida estate. While his allies have been demanding answers from officials over the unprecedented action, he could choose to provide some himself. That's because he'll have a copy of the warrant and the inventory of material removed from his property. Yet his public statements suggest he's been left in the dark, and he has repeatedly attacked the process. His supporters may believe the narrative that he is being persecuted. But - as Trump himself once did - others may see his refusal to answer questions as a sign there's substance to the case against him. Earlier this week, the FBI searched Mr Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago, reportedly in connection with his handling of classified records. A House of Representatives select committee is investigating his actions surrounding the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 - when his supporters rioted at Congress in Washington DC as lawmakers met to certify Mr Biden's election victory The justice department is examining his challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election A prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, is investigating whether Mr Trump and his associates tried to interfere in that state's results from the election A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that lawmakers can gain access to Mr Trump's tax records, affirming the decision of a lower court Read more:How big are Trump's legal problems?

"Energy crisis is on scale of pandemic - Martin LewisGovernment support needs to double to make up for the huge expected rise in bills, the consumer expert says.Business","This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic The situation with energy bills is ""a national crisis"" on the scale of the Covid pandemic, Martin Lewis has said. The consumer expert told the BBC support needed to double tomake up for the huge expected risein bills. The government said it had ""continually taken action to help households"". It comes as a survey by comparison site Uswitch suggested many people are already behind on energy bill payments with total debt owed three times higher than in September last year. Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 on average, according to the survey of 2,000 people. Uswitch advised people falling into debt to speak to their provider to work out a more affordable payment plan. The figures come a day after consultancy Cornwall Insight warned energy bills couldrise much higher than previously thoughtin October. Cornwall also expects bills to increase much more sharply in January, with the average household paying Â£355 a month, instead of the current Â£164 a month. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Mr Lewis said according to forecasts, the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - would effectively double between May of this year and October. The latest price cap is due to be announced at the end of this month by the energy regulator Ofgem. In May the government announced a package of support, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for more than eight million low-income households. But Mr Lewis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If [the chancellor] is going to be consistent, he will need to double every number in that package."" Ministers are set tohold talks with energy giantson Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. However, Mr Lewis said ultimately it was ""government alone"" which could help by putting ""more money into people's pockets"". The boss of Octopus Energy also said he thought the government needed to improve its offer of Â£400 for households to help with rising energy bills. Greg Jackson told the BBC that while the initial package of support may have been ""right"" at the time, ""clearly it's not sufficient now and we need to look at a similarly significant assistance from the government for this winter"". Derek Lickorish, chairman of energy supplier Utilita, called for a social tariff, which offers discounted rates for lower income households, to be introduced. He also said the government needed to ""dramatically"" increase support by Â£800 - Â£1,000 per household. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the Treasury had been preparing ""options"" for the next prime minister on what further support could be offered. However, Treasury officials have stressed that any decisions on major fiscal issues will be decided after the new PM takes office. Leadership frontrunner Liz Truss rejected the idea of holding talks with Boris Johnson and her rival Rishi Sunak before the end of the contest, saying ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". She denied she was ruling out payments to help with energy bills. However, stressing her support for tax cuts, Ms Truss said her priority was ""making sure we're not taking money off people and then giving it back to them later on"". James has had to take out a loan to cover his family's energy bill James Gilmour, who lives with his partner and three children in Essex, has taken out a Â£5,000 loan to help cover his energy bills when they go up in October. His gas and electricity bill has already doubled from Â£145 per month to Â£320 a month and from October he said he will be paying more than Â£600 per month, according to the latest forecasts. ""As a family of five we simply cannot afford to pay this monthly as we are already getting half way into the month with no money left for food and essentials,"" he told the BBC. James, who works in the automotive industry, said the loan was ""the only way to survive through this crisis"". Read more here. There are two main reasons households end up in debt to their supplier: the first reason, their direct debit payments may be set too low to cover the amount of energy being used. Anyone who finds themselves in that position should contact their supplier as quickly as possible to avoid a sudden bill shock, and give it their correct meter readings. The second reason is because people are just not keeping up with their payments. The Uswitch survey revealed that in addition to the group in debt, eight million households have no credit balances, meaning they have no cushion against the bill rises this winter. ""This is an alarming situation, as summer is traditionally a time when households are using less power for heating, which helps bill payers to build up energy credit ahead of the winter,"" said Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at Uswitch.com. An Ofgem spokesperson said its ""priority"" is to ""protect consumers"" and make sure suppliers treat their customers in a ""fair and reasonable manner"". A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We know the pressures people are facing with rising costs, which is why we have continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year."" Separately on Wednesday, E.On reported first-half profits of just under â¬4.1bn (Â£3.5bn), which was about â¬700m below the previous year. The company, which is one of the UK's biggest energy suppliers, described the energy crisis as ""extraordinary"", and said it highlighted the need for Europe ""to transform its energy system. To be independent of Russian gas. To ensure supply security"". It is worth saying again that the old advice to shop around to find a better energy deal just does not apply anymore. The default price cap, although super high, is the best rate available at the moment, so don't be pushed into signing up for a new fixed deal unless you want to, as you may end up paying more in the long-run. If you are falling behind on your energy payments, or are unable to keep-up with the increases in direct debits being suggested by your supplier, then the first thing to do is let them know you're struggling. Making that call might be tough, as it's never easy to admit you're finding things difficult, however it's likely to be the best protection for your household this winter. Taking action is important because there is an extra layer of legal help available for people who are unable to pay, which forces suppliers to work through lots of different options with their customers. That includes agreeing a payment plan, giving temporary credit for prepayment customers, and arranging for payment directly through benefits. Crucially, making that call to explain that you're struggling means they can't just cut you off. 'I'm borrowing Â£5,000 to pay my energy bills' What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?

Energy crisis is worse than Covid - pub owner,"Gareth Kelly and Mikey Lennon, owners of the Kings Arms in Fenwick, have tried to shield customers from price rises The spiralling cost of energy is worse than the Covid pandemic for the hospitality industry, according to one Scottish pub owner. Mikey Lennon said his electricity bill for the King's Arms in Fenwick, East Ayrshire, has risen from Â£960 a month to more than Â£3,300. The gas bill has jumped by Â£1,200 in the last three months. Without immediate government action, he fears businesses like his will be forced to turn off the lights for good. It came as consumer expert Martin Lewis warned that the situation with domestic energy bills was a""national crisis"" on the scale of the Covid pandemic. Nicola Sturgeon issues cost of living warning to Boris Johnson Cost of living: Why are things so hard for so many people? How rising prices are affecting people in Scotland Mr Lennon toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandthat trying to shield customers from price rises was pushing his business to the brink. ""We have absorbed a lot of the cost ourselves trying to not put prices up and push rises on to customers, but with the current climate we find it increasingly hard,"" he said. ""It is already apparent it is more difficult than Covid. We thought that was going to be the worst thing that was ever going to happen to the hospitality industry. ""In the pandemic, there was a lot of support, funding and grants to get our industry through Covid and right now there is nothing - not even the right conversations happening from the right people. ""There is no price cap for commercial units' utilities and we can't see where it is going to stop."" The pub is the hub of the village of 1,500 people and Mr Lennon and co-owner Gareth Kelly feel that pulling the shutters down on the only place to meet would be devastating. ""This can't continue,"" said Mr Lennon. ""The sad truth is that businesses are going to be pushed under if these costs don't get under control very quickly."" Colin Wilkinson, the managing director of the Scottish Licenced Trade Association, has called for the introduction of an energy price cap for commercial businesses. He said: ""We are deeply concerned. Many businesses are saying this is worse because there is no financial support as there was with Covid. That wasn't enough, but it was something. ""We are hearing talk of businesses closing over winter. Energy bills are increasing threefold. ""They are trying to absorb it, and are conscious that customers are also looking at a severe reduction in disposable income. ""We need a price cap for commercial businesses, and a realistic cap for commercial rates. The government needs to support businesses through this."" Energy prices: How will the Â£5bn windfall tax work? BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as energy bills soar The Scottish government said ministers were in regular dialogue with business organisations and leaders who had made clear that the high cost of doing business in the UK was ""significantly hampering"" their ability to recover from the pandemic. A spokeswoman added: ""We support the calls from businesses for measures related to energy prices, VAT reduction, staff shortages and handling business loans, direct support which falls within the reserved responsibilities of the UK government. ""Without action from UK ministers, an overall rise in business failures is to be expected and the Scottish government urges them to take immediate action on the interventions requested by businesses."" The Kings Arms is the hub of Fenwick village and is where locals meet up Earlier this week,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Boris Johnsonto request an ""emergency meeting"" over the cost of living crisis. She told the prime minister only the UK government could access resources ""on the scale required"". The UK government said in May that oil and gas companies would be taxed an additional 25% for the next 12 months to help households with rising bills. However Boris Johnson has said he has no plans to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of electricity firms before he steps down as prime minister.

Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RACThe margin between the price of fuel at the pump and what retailers buy it for is at its widest since 2013.BusinessComments,"Supermarkets are not cutting fuel prices by as much as they should do to match the ""significant"" drop in the cost of wholesale fuel, the RAC has said. The motoring group said the gap between pump prices and wholesale prices was the widest in almost a decade. The price of petrol on Tuesday was about Â£1.76 per litre, but RAC analysts suggested it should be about Â£1.62. Fuel prices have hit record highs this year, but are slowly starting to fall. The RAC said at the start of the week, the average petrol price at the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, was Â£1.74 per litre. Diesel was Â£1.86. Meanwhile the average for the delivered wholesale petrol price last week was Â£1.24, while diesel was Â£1.38. After factoring in VAT, fuel duty and a ""generous"" retailer margin of 10p per litre, the RAC said ""forecourts should soon be selling unleaded for no more than Â£1.62"". Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? ""There appears to have been a big shift in the last few months in the behaviour of the four major supermarkets, which dominate UK fuel retailing, as they are now commonly being undercut by independent retailers that are passing on the wholesale cost savings they're benefitting from to drivers at the pumps,"" said Simon Williams, RAC's fuel spokesman. ""This is unheard of as the supermarkets are normally at least 3p a litre cheaper than the UK average."" The reason supermarkets are usually cheaper than independent retailers is because they buy fuel more frequently meaning they can react quickly when wholesale prices move up or down. Mr Williams said that was ""often demonstrated by the speed at which they pass on increases on their forecourts when wholesale prices rise"". ""As the supermarkets account for so much of all the fuel sold across the country and they haven't lowered their prices as much as they should have, it means average UK prices have not come down in line with the significant drop in wholesale fuel,"" he added. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons have been contacted for comment. The gap between retail and wholesale prices, excluding VAT, is the widest since the RAC started monitoring them in 2013. The RAC said the current gap exceeded the difference between wholesale and retail prices at the start of the pandemic, when the country went into lockdown, and the price of oil plunged to about $13 a barrel. Oil has been consistently at around $100 per barrel in recent months. Fuel prices were already rising before the war in Ukraine started in February, but the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but is facing sanctions as a result of its actions in Ukraine. This has pushed up demand for oil from other producers, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Petrol and diesel prices usually move when the price of crude oil goes up or down. In mid-June, the RAC revealed petrol prices hit new record highs every day for a month, which led to the average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up. Why are petrol prices going back up?

Eurovision 2023 will force other shows to make wayCouncil officials confirm Eurovision organisers need access to a venue six weeks ahead of the contest.,"Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won this year's contest with overwhelming support from the public vote No large arena in the UK currently has enough of a gap in its event listings to host Eurovision next year. Several council officials told BBC News that organisers told them a venue would be needed by producers six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest. Cities hoping to host the event will find out on Friday if they will be shortlisted. It's now almost certain other tour dates will need to be postponed or cancelled to make room for it in May. Magic Mike, AndrÃ© Rieu and Elton John all have shows booked in places bidding to hold the contest during that period, including Liverpool, Leeds and Glasgow. Listen to 5 Minutes On - Eurovision 2023: Destination UK Producers of the Magic Mike tour - who have dates scheduled in April and May in potential host cities such as Newcastle and Manchester - confirmed to BBC News that they had not been asked to move any tour dates as yet. Tickets remain on sale for the shows, as a final decision on the venue won't be made until the autumn, compounding logistical issues. Typically the country that wins the contest hosts Eurovision the following year, but next year - amid the ongoing war in Ukraine - the UK will host, after Sam Ryder emerged as the 2022 runner up. This year's head of show in Turin, Claudio Santucci, confirmed that organisers would need access to the venue for several weeks. ""The set up takes around three weeks, then three or four weeks of rehearsals - but one of those weeks is the show"", Mr Santucci explained. He was responsible for the opening, interval and closing sequences of this year's competition, after working with Italian broadcaster RAI on its winning entry the previous year. ""It's a long period of rehearsals to make it work,"" he said. ""It's an event that would normally take two years to organise but instead you have less than a year because you only know when you win."" The BBCaccepted the invitationto host the event in 2023 after organisers ruled - for safety reasons - thatit couldn't take place in Ukraine, followingKalush Orchestra's triumphin May. It means the broadcaster, which will have to pay between Â£8m and Â£16m to host, has even less time to organise the complex production. This year's Armenian entrant Rosa Linn is currently charting around the world after going viral online Neither the BBC nor the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) - which puts on the song contest - would confirm how long a site would be needed. Organisers also refused to detail the exact requirements they had requested from cities in the first stage of the application process - instead pointing toan FAQ website. It says: ""Last year the EBU's host city criteria was based on providing a venue able to accommodate at least 10,000 spectators (as well as a press centre), that should be within easy reach of an international airport and with ample hotel accommodation."" Bristol's mayor said it has applied to host, despite not having an arena - and is committed to build a bespoke venue for the event in less than nine months. Last week Cardiff said it wouldno longer be putting forwarda bid for the song contest, explaining ""a significant number of scheduled events"" would need to be cancelled. All other cities with an arena that can fit 10,000 fans - and are therefore eligible to bid - face the same problem. Many arenas told BBC News that if their venue is chosen, then discussions will take place with those productions already booked, but said they could not respond to financial costs queries because the hosting opportunity was only hypothetical at this stage and every event contract is different.

'I've been let down - I shouldn't have stage-4 cancer'Caroline Boulton says there have been delays at every stage of her treatment for breast cancer.,"Caroline Boulton has been told nothing can be done for her cancer now A woman with fast-growing stage-four breast cancer says the NHS has let her down, with delays at every stage of her treatment. Caroline Boulton, 56, had several appointments for a mammogram, which checks for early signs of cancer, cancelled because of Covid, in March and November 2020. In late 2021, she found a small lump, went to her GP and was referred urgently to a specialist - but then the delays began. ""They haven't moved quickly enough,"" Ms Boulton says, who lives in Greater Manchester. ""It's been really, really slow."" ""Between each appointment, each scan, there's been four-, five-, six-, seven-, eight-week waiting times and delays every time."" The referral letter came through ""very quickly"" but then she waited three weeks, instead of the recommended two, to see a consultant. ""When I first found the lump, it was only pea-sized,"" Ms Boulton says. ""By the time I got to see the consultant, it was the size of a tangerine."" Her cancer was growing quickly, she was told, but it would be eight weeks before a mastectomy could be scheduled to remove her breast. ""Considering it was fast-growing, that's a huge concern - you're living with that, waiting, knowing it's growing,"" Ms Boulton says. When she finally saw an oncologist seven months after finding the lump, had another scan and received the results, the cancer had spread to her liver - and there was no longer any treatment they could offer. ""I've now got stage-four cancer that I shouldn't have - and two years to live."" The oncologist told her she had 30 lesions on her liver and said: ""There's nothing - nothing we can do for you."" Two years had passed from the date of her first cancelled mammogram to finding out the devastating news. Ms Boulton had to tell her partner Wendy that her cancer had spread to her liver and was now incurable Figures leaked to the Health Service Journal and seen by BBC Newsnight: 327,395 people are on England's cancer waiting list nearly 40,000 have been waiting more than 62 days after a GP referral for suspected cancer the number waiting more than 104 days, has doubled since June 2021, to over 10,000 During the pandemic, cancer screening, treatment and operations were cancelled to free up staff and hospital beds, creating long waits for care and causing patients huge anxiety. The record numbers now coming forward with cancer symptoms means cancers are being caught earlier than before - but it's creating enormous demand, NHS England says. ""We have written to local NHS services making clear that reducing cancer waits is a key priority, helping them redesign their care to meet the increased demand as well as investing billions in extra diagnostic and treatment capacity across the country,"" it added. But leading oncologist Prof Pat Price, from Imperial College London, says: ""This is the worst cancer crisis of my lifetime. ""The waits for cancer treatment are the worst they've ever been - and they're getting worse. ""We have to get on and address this crisis. This is an absolute disaster.""

Chancellor pledges energy bill discount for NI,"Nadhim Zahawi is visiting Northern Ireland on Wednesday Nadhim Zahawi will meet Stormont's economy and community ministers again next week to discuss the delivery of an equivalent Â£400 energy bill discount. The chancellor made the announcement following meetings with the ministers and the utility regulator on Wednesday. In May,the government drew up plans to help all households in the UKwith rising fuel bills. But the lack of a functioning executive meant it was unclearhow the scheme would reach Northern Ireland. Mr Zahawi said he was confident about bringing similar measures to Northern Ireland. ""The reason that I wanted a meeting next Monday is to make sure we make progress urgently,"" he told BBC News NI. The chancellor added he wanted to find a ""pragmatic solution"" to allow families to avail of the Â£400 discount. ""The United Kingdom government has promised to deliver this Â£400 to families in Northern Ireland as quickly as possible,"" he said. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said a solution needed to be found quickly ""My colleagues here collectively are focused to deliver this and I'm confident that we will do it."" Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme earlier, the chancellor also said the government's priority was to get the power-sharing executive restored. ""But operationally, to help people with the cost of energy, I have to focus now to make sure we get this money out the door, the Â£400 for families and households in Northern Ireland."" The Treasury would have ordinarily made the payment via a Barnett Consequential to Northern Ireland, as it had previously done with a Â£200 energy loan payment scheme. This video can not be played 'We're stretched to our limits' - parents worried over rising cost of living It uses the Barnett formula to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affect devolved services. However, the Treasury said without a functioning government at Stormont to sign off on the money, it was considering other ways of applying the discount. Communities Minister, Sinn Fein's Deirdre Hargey, said a solution needed to be found quickly. ""The quickest solution here is to have a functional government, but in the absence of that we're having to find work arounds,"" she said. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said that time was of the essence to bring the scheme to Northern Ireland Following Wednesday's meeting, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said it was accepted that the Treasury directly paying energy companies was the easiest solution. ""I see this now as the quickest way of getting this money into people's pockets,"" he said. This is Nadhim Zahawi's first visit to Northern Ireland since he took over as chancellor last month. He's got to work out how to get that discount off the electricity bills of people here. In Great Britain, people will get that discount from October. The Treasury has said that the absence of a functioning executive is going to make it a lot more difficult to do that here. There's clearly a commitment there, but the problem is we still don't know how, or when, people here will get this money. Two of the ministers at Stormont that are still in place have been pushing Mr Zahawi to get this money out as quickly as possible. One further complication is that the utility regulator may also have to carry out a 90-day public consultation before it can direct the local electricity providers to make that discount on people's bills. That could delay people getting that discount even further into the new year, just when they might be needing it most. Stormont has been without a power-sharing executive since February, due to theDUP's ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the post-Brexit trading arrangements are changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post, but they are unable to take major policy decisions. On Tuesday, a children's doctor said she feared what the winter would bring for families facing pressure due to the cost-of-living crisis. Dr Julie-Ann Maney, a consultant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, said more than one quarter of children in Northern Ireland were living in poverty. In Great Britain, the first of six instalments of thediscount will be applied to households' energy bills in October. The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland has urged politicians to do ""whatever it takes"" to help older people with their energy payments. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle on Wednesday, Eddie Lynch said that many older people were worried about the coming winter months and any assistance to their energy payments would go a long way. ""We understand officials are working behind the scenes to try and find a way to introduce this payment to people,"" he said. Eddie Lynch says there is a real concern among older people over rising energy costs ""But what we are still unclear about is when this is going to happen, and how this is going to happen. ""I think in the absence of that information, the fear and concern amongst older people about the cost of living will continue to rise. ""My message to the authorities today would be to just get it done, get this in place whatever it takes.""

How will I get cost-of-living payments?,"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February.

It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS.

Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.

How does windfall tax on energy firms work?,"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase in November, and will remain in place until March 2030. The levy was introduced as a response to soaring energy company profits, and was designed to help fund a scheme to limit household gas and electricity bills. However, firms in the sector have warned that the increase will hit jobs and investment. A windfall tax is a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Global oil and gas prices started to rise in late 2020 as demand increased with the lifting of Covid restrictions, but they soared in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The increase in prices led to bumper profits for energy companies, leading to calls for a windfall tax. The Energy Profits Levy - the formal name for the windfall tax -was introduced in May 2022 by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,external. The government said the money raised would fund support for households facing rising energy bills. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. It was initially set at 25% and was due to expire at the end of 2025. In January 2023 the then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the levy to 35%. In the spring 2024 Budget,Hunt announced it would remain in place until March 2029because the continuing war in Ukraine was extending energy firms' windfall profits. The new Labour government saidit would increase the levy to 38% on 1 November,external. The tax will remain in place until 31 March 2030, unless - as originallyset out by the previous government- oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. A separate levy was also brought in on ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generating firms in the UK. Larger operators started payingthe Electricity Generator Levy,externalon 1 January 2023. It was hoped this would raise about Â£14bn over six years. Among the UK energy giants, BP reported a record profit of $27.7bn in 2022. While this fell to$13.8bn in 2023, it was still the firm's second highest annual profit in a decade. Shell's profits of $39.9bn in 2022 were the highest in its 115-year history. Its 2023profits were $28.2bn. BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea were already taxed differently before the levy was introduced In the financial year 2022-2023, the first year of its operation,the levy raised Â£2.6bn,external. In the following 12-month periodit raised Â£3.6bn,external. BP said its North Sea business paid $2.2bn in UK tax for its North Sea operations in 2022, of which $700m was due to the levy. In 2023 it paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn), including $720m under the levy. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. In 2023, it paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK, Â£240m of which was a result of the levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. In contrast, other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year pay 25% corporation tax. When the windfall tax is added, it means the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies operating in the UK is 75%, rising to 78% in November. However, oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of UK tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. BP,externalandShell,externalboth received more money back from the UK government than they paid in tax every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017). Energy firms have also been able to reduce the amount of windfall tax they pay through certain investment allowances. However, the government has said it will remove some of these allowances from 1 November. Further details on the changes to the windfall levy will be set out in the Budget on 30 October. What might be in the Budget? The industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the proposed changes to the windfall taxwill sharply reduce investment in the sector, putting thousands of jobs at risk. OEUK says the expected tax paid by oil and gas producers would ""increase in the very short term"" by Â£2bn, and would later result in a Â£12bn loss. In August, 42 companies wrote to the government toexpress their ""grave concern"" over the changes. The Treasury said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry about the levy. But it also said it wanted North Sea oil and gas producers ""to contribute their fair share towards our energy transition"" away from fossil fuels. Where does the UK get its energy from?

"Giggs' ex was slave to his demands, court hears","Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Wednesday Ryan Giggs' ex-girlfriend has told a court she became ""a slave to his every need and every demand"". The former Manchester United star and ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour and assaulting Kate Greville and her younger sister Emma. During cross-examination, she told Manchester Crown Court: ""He made me feel like I had to do what he said otherwise there were consequences"". He has denied all the charges. Ms Greville agreed she made a number of witness statements to police following the alleged assault in November 2020, including two in the last week. Giggs threw ex out of hotel room naked, court told Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears Chris Daw QC, representing Mr Giggs, asked: ""In the course of those statements, did you tell the police the whole truth?"". She replied: ""100%"". She also rejected claims an argument between the couple in Dubai in September 2017 ""were a complete pack of lies"". Ms Greville has claimed Mr Giggs dragged her naked across the floor of a hotel room and threw her and her belongings into the corridor, bruising her arm in the process. She did not tell anyone at the time about the incident as she was ashamed, and said that text messages in the days afterwards, where she told him ""I love you my gorgeous man"", were genuine. Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against Ms Greville between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of Emma Greville at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. ""It was me being genuine but Ryan had this way of turning everything around on me,"" Ms Greville said. ""I would be made to feel everything was my fault, so I felt I had to overcompensate. ""It's difficult to explain. We had this turbulent relationship. Obviously we had this argument but I desperately wanted this relationship to go back to the way it was. ""I was in denial about actually what had happened. I would never talk to him about it."" She also denied the bruise on her arm was caused by rough sex. Jurors heard a picture message sent to Mr Giggs a few days later read: ""Tan is coming along nicely. My sex bruise is coming along nicely too!!"". The barrister also questioned Ms Greville about her relationship with the former footballer and how they got together. ""I was in a vulnerable position and he played on it,"" she said. Mr Daw asked: ""This was not just two consenting adults, both equally married at the time, who embarked on an affair?"" The witness replied: ""There was a degree of imbalance on my side because of the situation I was in with my ex-husband."" Ms Greville told the court she was not happy and in a ""controlling marriage"", and noticed Mr Giggs was interested in her. She said Mr Giggs used her name a great deal, a technique she had read about from the psychology book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Mr Daw suggested she was implying there was some sort of ""clever psychological game"" in play. He said: ""The impression you give is you only really had an affair with Ryan because you were unhappy and he basically reeled you in?"" Ms Greville replied: ""I'm not saying it was all one-sided. I was fully involved in that. There was things about him that definitely were luring me into a relationship."" Mr Daw said: ""The truth is it's a complete fiction Ryan was using psychological techniques on your vulnerabilities. It's just rubbish?"" But Ms Greville responded saying: ""Absolutely not. I felt like he was using techniques. I was vulnerable, that's a fact. I was in a controlling relationship. That's a fact."" She told the court Mr Giggs' alleged controlling behaviour also affected her friendships and that ""he isolated me from certain people"", adding he also ""interfered with my ability to interact with my family"". Ms Greville told the court violence by Mr Giggs was ""not regular"" and he would use aggression more as a form of control. Mr Daw asked: ""Do you say he undermined your confidence, your self-esteem and was disparaging to you generally in those ways?"" She said: ""Yes, on the whole he was, but on the other side it was like two extremes. Other times he would give me confidence. ""He was not constantly awful, not constantly horrible. It was hot and cold. Two different people. The result of his behaviour... undermined my self-confidence."" She said he had also undermined and damaged her business. The court heard Ms Greville gave a statement the day before the start of the trial in which she said she had felt like ""a slave"" to the defendant. The court previously heard Ryan Giggs had eight relationships with other women while with Kate Greville She said: ""That is what it felt like. When Ryan said do something, I would do it. ""There was resistance sometimes but he made me feel like I had to do what he said, otherwise there would be consequences."" Ms Greville said she is ""really into psychology"" and during the relationship she Googled what was happening in her relationship. ""The thing that came up was not coercion, there was narcissistic personality disorder,"" she added. ""And what I was experiencing was very similar to that."" She also denied she was looking for compensation when the case ends. Mr Daw asked if for the majority of the time the couple were together, he was kind and loving to her. Ms Greville said: ""To begin with, yes. I would say for four-and-half years he was nice and for a year-and-a-half he was not. Near the end it was much pretty much relentlessly awful."" She said she had noticed a ""significant change"" when she returned to Manchester in January 2018. Around the same time Mr Giggs was applying for the manager's job of the Wales national team but she said it was not the workload which led him to become more distant. ""There was obviously other things going on in his life as well,"" she said. The court also heard the following month Mr Giggs' daughter found out about couple's relationship from a Valentine's card Ms Greville sent while he was still married to his wife Stacey. Ms Greville said: ""He was lying to them, so it was making the situation worse."" In 2019, Mr Giggs is said to have sent an email following a row with the title ""blackmail"" and a video attached. Jurors heard this was sent after Ms Greville blocked Mr Giggs on WhatsApp and he was trying to get her to respond. She told police she suspected the attachment was, ""one of our videos that we had done"" and he was threatening to share it with work colleagues if she did not unblock him and respond to his messages. But Ms Greville said she did not view the attachment and deleted it, saying: ""It could have been something funny, but it could have been a sexual video."" Mr Daw said: ""Mr Giggs would have significant interest in private sexual videos getting into the public domain. You knew full well it was not a sexual video,"" he added claiming she had watched it. The barrister said Mr Giggs had deleted the videos and, when the couple got back together six weeks later, he asked Ms Greville to send them to him again, which she did. Mr Daw asked: ""Did it not cross your mind at some future date that the issue may arise again?"" She replied: ""I thought he had changed and he was in a different place. This was the same cycle of things. He promised he would change."" She said things ""ramped up"" during the first Covid-19 lockdown when they lived together. Ms Greville said the abuse was verbal but became written in messages and emails towards the end of the relationship because ""I was standing up for myself"". The jury previously heard Mr Giggs grabbed her by the shoulders and headbutted her in November 2020 after she earlier confronted him about his alleged serial cheating. She said in the lead-up to the alleged assault, she had learned he had ""full-on relationships"" with eight other women while they were together. The discovery of messages ""going back years"" on his iPad prompted her to decide to leave him, she said. The court heard the police wanted Kate Greville to hand over her phone as part of their investigation but she told them she lost it at the end of last year when it dropped in a river as she ""tried to rescue my dog from the water"". Another phone went missing when she was mugged in Market Street in Manchester city centre which left her ""distraught"", she added. The court heard police told her any data could be retrieved from iCloud but she did not want details of her business revealed. Queried over his line of questioning, Mr Daw told the judge it was ""designed towards the proposition that the witness deliberately withheld information that would undermine the case against Mr Giggs"", which she denied.

Eurovision 2023 will force other shows to make way,"Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won this year's contest with overwhelming support from the public vote No large arena in the UK currently has enough of a gap in its event listings to host Eurovision next year. Several council officials told BBC News that organisers told them a venue would be needed by producers six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest. Cities hoping to host the event will find out on Friday if they will be shortlisted. It's now almost certain other tour dates will need to be postponed or cancelled to make room for it in May. Magic Mike, AndrÃ© Rieu and Elton John all have shows booked in places bidding to hold the contest during that period, including Liverpool, Leeds and Glasgow. Listen to 5 Minutes On - Eurovision 2023: Destination UK Producers of the Magic Mike tour - who have dates scheduled in April and May in potential host cities such as Newcastle and Manchester - confirmed to BBC News that they had not been asked to move any tour dates as yet. Tickets remain on sale for the shows, as a final decision on the venue won't be made until the autumn, compounding logistical issues. Typically the country that wins the contest hosts Eurovision the following year, but next year - amid the ongoing war in Ukraine - the UK will host, after Sam Ryder emerged as the 2022 runner up. This year's head of show in Turin, Claudio Santucci, confirmed that organisers would need access to the venue for several weeks. ""The set up takes around three weeks, then three or four weeks of rehearsals - but one of those weeks is the show"", Mr Santucci explained. He was responsible for the opening, interval and closing sequences of this year's competition, after working with Italian broadcaster RAI on its winning entry the previous year. ""It's a long period of rehearsals to make it work,"" he said. ""It's an event that would normally take two years to organise but instead you have less than a year because you only know when you win."" The BBCaccepted the invitationto host the event in 2023 after organisers ruled - for safety reasons - thatit couldn't take place in Ukraine, followingKalush Orchestra's triumphin May. It means the broadcaster, which will have to pay between Â£8m and Â£16m to host, has even less time to organise the complex production. This year's Armenian entrant Rosa Linn is currently charting around the world after going viral online Neither the BBC nor the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) - which puts on the song contest - would confirm how long a site would be needed. Organisers also refused to detail the exact requirements they had requested from cities in the first stage of the application process - instead pointing toan FAQ website. It says: ""Last year the EBU's host city criteria was based on providing a venue able to accommodate at least 10,000 spectators (as well as a press centre), that should be within easy reach of an international airport and with ample hotel accommodation."" Bristol's mayor said it has applied to host, despite not having an arena - and is committed to build a bespoke venue for the event in less than nine months. Last week Cardiff said it wouldno longer be putting forwarda bid for the song contest, explaining ""a significant number of scheduled events"" would need to be cancelled. All other cities with an arena that can fit 10,000 fans - and are therefore eligible to bid - face the same problem. Many arenas told BBC News that if their venue is chosen, then discussions will take place with those productions already booked, but said they could not respond to financial costs queries because the hosting opportunity was only hypothetical at this stage and every event contract is different.

Stranded whale put down during rescue mission,"This video can not be played The whale was trapped for several days before the failed rescue mission A beluga whale that became stranded in France's Seine river had to be put down, ending a dramatic rescue mission that captivated world audiences. Officials say vets took the decision as the four-metre (13ft) mammal was being moved in a refrigerated truck. Overnight, rescuers spent nearly six hours lifting the 800kg (1,763lb) whale from the river using a crane and nets. They had planned to release the animal in the sea but its health deteriorated after failing to eat. ""It is with heavy hearts we announce that the beluga did not survive,"" Sea Shepherd France conservation group wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. ""We are devastated by this tragic outcome that we knew was very likely,"" it added. Meanwhile, Florence Ollivet-Courtois, a vet for the local emergency services, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that ""the animal was not getting enough air and [was] suffering visibly."" ""We therefore decided that it made no sense to set it free and proceeded to euthanasia,"" the vet added. Experts are still puzzled as to how the whale - who had been trapped more than 100km (62 miles) inland - managed to stray so far south, away from its natural habitat. On Wednesday, crowds were seen gathering on the banks of the river in the northern town of Saint-Pierre-La-Garenne to watch the rescue. But interest in the whale's survival spread far beyond France, and conservation groups and a number of individuals have made financial donations to help the rescue operation. Belugas occasionally venture south in the autumn to feed as ice forms, but it is rare for them to travel so far from their native home. According to France's Pelagis Observatory which specialises in sea mammals, the nearest beluga population is off the Svalbard archipelago, north of Norway, 3,000km (1,870 miles) from the Seine. But similar stories are not unheard of. In May,a killer whale was found dead after swimming up the River Seine in Normandy.And in 2019, adead whale was found in the River Thames near Gravesend, UK officials said.

Wildlife under stress as dry spell shrinks riversMost of the world's chalk streams are in southern and eastern England and are under particular strain.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Fish are under pressure from hotter temperatures and lower river flows Environmental groups say the prolonged dry spell is having a ""serious"" impact on wildlife in rivers. With rivers already under pressure from pollution and use for drinking water, they say the looming drought is adding to the strain. Chalk streams, which support iconic species such as the salmon, kingfisher and otter, are of particular concern, according to the Rivers Trust. Only 200 exist globally, 85% of which are in southern and eastern England. ""This is our Barrier Reef or our Amazon rainforest; it's our unique contribution to global wildlife and biodiversity,"" said Christine Colvin of the Rivers Trust. The River Anton in Hampshire is much lower than usual She said some small chalk streams were starting to dry up, while larger rivers were experiencing low flows. ""The wildlife here is already stressed as a result of the hotter temperatures and their habitat is shrinking as the water levels are getting lower and lower,"" she added. ""We don't want them to go any lower than they are now."" What is biodiversity and how can we protect it? Pressure grows for global deal to save nature Nature's true value overlooked in decision making Chalk rivers support a wide range of water-loving plants Jamie Marsh, reserves manager for the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, warned of ""a serious situation"" for wildlife as rivers run low in parts of the region. At one nature reserve on the banks of the River Itchen in Winchester, a pond has completely dried up, while low river flow is hitting food sources for fish, insects and invertebrates, with knock-on effects for animals higher up the food chain such as water voles and otters. ""Our water resources are under a lot of pressure and this long period of drought is exacerbating those issues,"" he said. ""What we can do to help is we as a society can look at our water consumption and try and reduce down our consumption. ""For many of our rivers, they're not in a natural state; they've been heavily modified and engineered. Many of our river systems are acting more like drains than actual rivers now."" A dried-up pond at the Winnall Moors Nature Reserve in Winchester Chalk streams and rivers rise from springs in chalk bedrock - a layer of spongy rock found beneath much of southern and eastern England, that can hold vast quantities of water. This layer of white limestone is composed of the same material that makes up the white cliffs of Dover and supplies water for rivers and taps in much of the south east of England. Water is pumped out of the ground or taken directly from rivers, to the tune of millions of litres a day. Southern Water, which supplies water to Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, said the decision to introduce a hosepipe ban was a ""vital step"" to protect the habitats of the River Test and the River Itchen, where it extracts water. The company has said river flows were about 25% lower than they should be for July. Algae blooms are appearing on lakes during the hot weather And according tothe latest projections,externalby scientists, river flows are expected to remain exceptionally low in central and southern England for the rest of the summer. Water UK, which represents the water industry, has said water companies with chalk streams in their regions have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in reducing and ending abstractions of water and further reductions will take place over the next few years. However, the Rivers Trust has called for a total rethink in the way we use water to cope as dry hot summers likely become more frequent. ""We want to see government and the water companies responding in a coordinated way,"" said Christine Colvin. ""This hot spell and this prolonged dry period is a pressure test for us now to get ready for the long haul because we're going to be seeing many more summers like this in years to come."" Mammals such as otters can struggle to find food if river levels run too low Other wildlife is also struggling to find food during the long dry spell, including birds that feed on worms in the soil and ground-feeding mammals such as badgers. Butterflies, solitary bees, hoverflies and insects may also be suffering as plants produce less nectar when they are experiencing water stress, said the Royal Horticultural Society. Helen Bostock, RHS senior wildlife specialist said: ""With many species of wild pollinator still in decline they need all the help they can get, but we can think of gardens as service stations for these pollinating insects. In a drought your garden might be the only reliable place a bumblebee or hoverfly can find water and nectar. "" Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.

Belugas occasionally venture south in the autumn to feed as ice forms, but it is rare for them to travel so far from their native home. According to France's Pelagis Observatory which specialises in sea mammals, the nearest beluga population is off the Svalbard archipelago, north of Norway, 3,000km (1,870 miles) from the Seine. But similar stories are not unheard of. In May,a killer whale was found dead after swimming up the River Seine in Normandy.And in 2019, adead whale was found in the River Thames near Gravesend, UK officials said.

Chancellor pledges energy bill discount for NINadhim Zahawi will meet Stormont ministers and the utility regulator over a Â£400 energy bill discount scheme.Northern IrelandComments,"Nadhim Zahawi is visiting Northern Ireland on Wednesday Nadhim Zahawi will meet Stormont's economy and community ministers again next week to discuss the delivery of an equivalent Â£400 energy bill discount. The chancellor made the announcement following meetings with the ministers and the utility regulator on Wednesday. In May,the government drew up plans to help all households in the UKwith rising fuel bills. But the lack of a functioning executive meant it was unclearhow the scheme would reach Northern Ireland. Mr Zahawi said he was confident about bringing similar measures to Northern Ireland. ""The reason that I wanted a meeting next Monday is to make sure we make progress urgently,"" he told BBC News NI. The chancellor added he wanted to find a ""pragmatic solution"" to allow families to avail of the Â£400 discount. ""The United Kingdom government has promised to deliver this Â£400 to families in Northern Ireland as quickly as possible,"" he said. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said a solution needed to be found quickly ""My colleagues here collectively are focused to deliver this and I'm confident that we will do it."" Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme earlier, the chancellor also said the government's priority was to get the power-sharing executive restored. ""But operationally, to help people with the cost of energy, I have to focus now to make sure we get this money out the door, the Â£400 for families and households in Northern Ireland."" The Treasury would have ordinarily made the payment via a Barnett Consequential to Northern Ireland, as it had previously done with a Â£200 energy loan payment scheme. This video can not be played 'We're stretched to our limits' - parents worried over rising cost of living It uses the Barnett formula to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affect devolved services. However, the Treasury said without a functioning government at Stormont to sign off on the money, it was considering other ways of applying the discount. Communities Minister, Sinn Fein's Deirdre Hargey, said a solution needed to be found quickly. ""The quickest solution here is to have a functional government, but in the absence of that we're having to find work arounds,"" she said. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said that time was of the essence to bring the scheme to Northern Ireland Following Wednesday's meeting, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said it was accepted that the Treasury directly paying energy companies was the easiest solution. ""I see this now as the quickest way of getting this money into people's pockets,"" he said. This is Nadhim Zahawi's first visit to Northern Ireland since he took over as chancellor last month. He's got to work out how to get that discount off the electricity bills of people here. In Great Britain, people will get that discount from October. The Treasury has said that the absence of a functioning executive is going to make it a lot more difficult to do that here. There's clearly a commitment there, but the problem is we still don't know how, or when, people here will get this money. Two of the ministers at Stormont that are still in place have been pushing Mr Zahawi to get this money out as quickly as possible. One further complication is that the utility regulator may also have to carry out a 90-day public consultation before it can direct the local electricity providers to make that discount on people's bills. That could delay people getting that discount even further into the new year, just when they might be needing it most. Stormont has been without a power-sharing executive since February, due to theDUP's ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the post-Brexit trading arrangements are changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post, but they are unable to take major policy decisions. On Tuesday, a children's doctor said she feared what the winter would bring for families facing pressure due to the cost-of-living crisis. Dr Julie-Ann Maney, a consultant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, said more than one quarter of children in Northern Ireland were living in poverty. In Great Britain, the first of six instalments of thediscount will be applied to households' energy bills in October. The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland has urged politicians to do ""whatever it takes"" to help older people with their energy payments. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle on Wednesday, Eddie Lynch said that many older people were worried about the coming winter months and any assistance to their energy payments would go a long way. ""We understand officials are working behind the scenes to try and find a way to introduce this payment to people,"" he said. Eddie Lynch says there is a real concern among older people over rising energy costs ""But what we are still unclear about is when this is going to happen, and how this is going to happen. ""I think in the absence of that information, the fear and concern amongst older people about the cost of living will continue to rise. ""My message to the authorities today would be to just get it done, get this in place whatever it takes.""

Ministers to meet energy giants over cost of livingNadhim Zahawi and Kwasi Kwarteng will speak to bosses of gas and electricity firms to discuss rising costs.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic Ministers will hold talks with energy giants on Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. The government says talks will focus on how energy companies can alleviate pressure on consumers. But Treasury officials have stressed that any big decisions will be decided by the next prime minister, when they take office in early September. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he would make sure options and ideas were in place for the new PM. Concerns over what will happen this winter come as figures suggest many households are already in energy debt. Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak said he would be ""happy"" to meet his rival Liz Truss to agree emergency support ahead of the winter. Ms Truss has dismissed the proposal telling reporters ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". Yet new figures from comparison service Uswitch laid bare the challenge facing Mr Johnson's successor. Unclaimed: Are you missing out on any universal credit? How high will my energy bill go? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 to energy firms, on average, with the total debt owed by the public triple that of September last year,according to a survey of 2,000 households. Forecasts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January - while the state pension is typically worth between Â£7,376 and Â£9,628. Mr Johnson has faced growing criticism for not announcing further support beyond the Â£15bn package set out in May, while the government is under pressure to do more to help with bills. Mr Zahawi said he was focused on ensuring that the money the government had already promised was getting ""into people's bank accounts"". He added that he would make sure ""we have the ideas and the options available to whoever becomes prime minister on the 5 September"". But consumer expert Martin Lewishas called on,externalwhat he described as the ""zombie"" government to ""wake up"" and put together a plan immediately. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the current situation to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are currently in that position of watching the beds in European hospitals and doing nothing about it,"" he said. On Wednesday morning, Ms Truss did not rule out making cash payments to help people with energy bills but said her priority would be to reverse April's National Insurance rise and temporarily drop green levies on energy bills arguing that low taxes were ""vitally important"" for growing the economy. She also said she would boost energy supply by ""getting more gas out of the North Sea"" and allowing more fracking to take place. Analysis by Rajdeep Sandhu, BBC political correspondent Liz Truss is trying to appeal to two different electorates at the same time. The first and arguably most important (right now) is the Conservative membership. Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister. But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs. That might explain why Liz Truss's language has been very careful in recent days. Because while she is convinced tax cuts are the way to help the economy grow, she isn't categorically ruling out direct support to those who are vulnerable. She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become prime minister and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. The Liberal Democratshave arguedthat the energy profits levy - or windfall tax - should be backdated to October 2021 and the extra money raised should be used to help people with energy bills. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Companies supplying energy are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic, but more recently because of supply constraints following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thelevy- which the Treasury previously said could raise up to Â£5bn - came into effect on 26 May. Energy firms like BP have reported recorded quarterly profits this year that will not be impacted by the levy. Asked about backdating the windfall tax, Ms Truss replied: ""The answer to our problems is not more taxes."" Speaking at a leadership hustings, former Chancellor Mr Sunak warned that the Conservative Party would be ""hammered"" at the next election without offering further direct support to households.

"Student loan interest rate capped at 6.3%The new cap applies to England and Wales, but analysts say it won't help students with rising costs.Family & Education","The interest rate on student loans in England and Wales is to be capped at 6.3% this autumn. It had been due to rise from the current 4.5% to 7.3%, but is being altered to ""align with the most recent data on market rates"" for loans. England's universities minister said she wanted to ""provide support"" amid the rising cost of living. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the change did ""nothing at all to protect current students"". Student loan interest rates will be reviewed again in December. The interest rate on the loan for those currently at university in England and Wales is calculated by adding 3% to the retail price index (RPI) - a measure of inflation which indicates the rate at which prices are rising. The RPI figure confirmed in April set the interest rate for the forthcoming academic year. Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicted the maximum rate on student loanswould jump from 4.5% to 12%from September this year. Subsequently, in June,the government said the rate would be capped at 7.3%to provide ""peace of mind for graduates"". Everything you need to know about student loans Students to pay off loans into their 60s, plans say Announcing the government's latest move, which sets the cap at 6.3%, Universities Minister Andrea Jenkyns said the further reduction in interest rates was intended to offer reassurance to anxious students. ""We understand that many people are worried about the impact of rising prices and we want to reassure people that we are we are stepping up to provide support where we can,"" she added. The Welsh government said it would follow suit. The announcement from the government does not change the amount that borrowers repay each month - it changes the total amount that they owe. Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the IFS, said most graduates' repayments would not be affected by the latest adjustment. ""Only the minority of, mostly high-earning, graduates set to pay off their loans in full will ever actually benefit from this,"" he said - adding that it would reduce a typical student loan balance by about Â£100 this autumn for recent graduates. ""Importantly, this does nothing at all to protect current students from the rising cost of living."" IFS analysis suggests that in the coming academic year, the real-terms value of maximum maintenance loans - for students from the poorest backgrounds -will fall to its lowest level in seven years.,external Commenting on the research, Mr Waltmann said: ""Unless the government changes course, students from the poorest families will be at least Â£100 out of pocket - per month."" For students starting degree courses from 2023,the interest rate will be fixed at a lower level. EASY RECIPES FOR KIDS:Want to get the kids enjoying cooking?

But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs.

She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become PM and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. Liz Truss says she wants to give people the power to ""keep
more of their own money"" and to bring in tax cuts to boost economic growth.
In aninterview with Londonâs Evening
Standard,external, the foreign secretary pledged to do ""all I can to
help"" people facing rises in their cost of living. If she becomes PM next month, Truss plans an emergency budget
and has said she would cancel the National Insurance rise, put forward by
former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, her leadership rival. She pledged, in her Standard interview: ""I can assure you that I will do all I can to
help households across Britain."" Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Gym owner Emily Wilkinson says she's facing a ""double
whammy"" of rising prices both at home and for her business, which is ""fighting
for survival"". Emily, who runs the gym with her husband in Macclesfield, says that just as her
company was recovering from Covid, she was hit with an energy bill for Â£1,000
per month, up from Â£480. ""That was in October 2021, six months before the energy
price cap increase. On 24 September, our electricity standing charge will
increase by 818% per day,"" she tells the BBC, urging the government to
take action to support small business owners. She says many businesses like hers can't risk passing on the price rise to
customers, who could go elsewhere. ""The general public think it's all over now Covid restrictions have been
dropped, but we feel like the fight is only just getting started,"" she
says. Chris PageIreland correspondent Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi says he ""will not rest"" until a way is found to deliver the Â£400 energy discount to households in Northern Ireland. Payments will begin in Great Britain in October, but there is uncertainty as to how the money can be distributed to people in Northern Ireland because of the current absence of the devolved government at Stormont. Zahawi has met two caretaker ministers in Belfast, and the local utilities regulator. Speaking afterwards on a visit to a business in Antrim, he said there had been a ""collective agreement we can do this"" and that a ""pragmatic solution"" was the way forward. He said he wanted to âkeep his promise"" that households in Northern Ireland would get their share of the money earmarked for the whole of the UK, and added that he wanted to be ""swift"". Read morehere. The UK is facing inflation of up to 13% in the coming months. But in the 1970s, inflation rapidly increased to
more than 25% due to rising oil prices and strong wage growth.Inflation was then brought largely under control
for the next few decades, despite some rises since 2008 related to the global
financial crisis and more recently the Covid pandemic. Last week, the Bank of England predicted that the cost of living could increase by more than 13% in the coming months, with high energy prices one of the
main reasons behind the rise. In addition to increased energy bills, consumers are also
having to deal with rising fuel prices. 
Although costs have dropped slightly from the record highs seen at the
beginning of July, current prices are still significantly higher than they were
at the start of the year. Michael RaceBusiness reporter Supermarkets are not cutting fuel prices by as much as they should to match the ""significant"" drop in the cost of wholesale fuel, the motoring group RAC says. It says the gap between pump prices and wholesale prices was the widest in almost a decade. The price of petrol on Tuesday was aboutÂ£1.76per litre, but RAC analysts suggested that after factoring in VAT, fuel duty and the ""generous"" retailer margin of 10p per litre, the price should be no more thanÂ£1.62. Fuel prices have hit record highs this year, but are slowly starting to fall. Energy customer Dallas Lucas has been speaking to the BBC,
saying the rise in energy prices has left her destitute. ""Right now Iâm sitting on a mattress in my flat, because I don't have a
bed or any furniture. I have been literally living on cereal and water, or
looking through bins for food. ""I've sold all my furniture. I don't have a washer or a
cooker anymore, just to try and keep up with the energy bills,"" she says. Dallas added that her gas bill had increased five-fold in recent

Earlier, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson, said he thinks households are ""safe"" from possible blackouts. Despite the ""terrible price crisis"", he said the UK had a more ""resilient supply"" than other countries in Europe. ""I think the reality is that domestic supply is safe and that industry - from time to time, sometimes driven by prices by the way - voluntarily reduce their energy usage,"" he told BBC Radio 4. Reasonable worst-case scenarios are used by the government to make sure it can respond to more extreme situations - they aren't forecasts about what will happen. There has been more blue-on-blue action, with
the foreign secretary's team saying the former chancellor had ""never""
made a tax cut and again compared him to Gordon Brown, who served as a Labour
chancellor and then PM. A spokesperson for Liz Truss' campaign said: ""Rishi

socialist tax and spend which will lead us to recession."" We've been looking at the rising cost of living - and energy prices in

We're ending up our live coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments in the cost of living crisis:  Michael RaceBusiness reporter, BBC News Energy bills could increase before the expected rise in October, the UK's energy regulator has revealed. Ofgem and industry body Energy UK said it was ""possible"" for suppliers to raise direct debits in advance of the new cap on energy prices kicking in. The warning comes as consumer expert Martin Lewis said any increase in the price cap, to be announced on 26 August, ""crystallizes the direct debits going up"". British Gas told the BBC it wouldn't put up prices before October. Rishi Sunak says he would ""go further in supporting those
families that most need our help"" with rising energy costs. He told the BBCâs Nick Robinson that he would rather lose the Tory
leadership race than ""win on a false promise"". His rival Liz Truss is pledging an emergency Budget with tax
cuts, but he plans targeted payments to pensioners and those on low incomes,
who may pay little or no tax, adding that was a ""moral responsibility"". Their interview airs at 19:00 BST on Wednesday on BBC One âwatch hereandread more here. Rajdeep SandhuPolitical Correspondent Liz Truss is trying to appeal to two different electorates at the same time. The first and arguably most important - right now - is the Conservative membership. Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister. But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs. That might explain why Liz Truss' language has been very careful in recent days. Because while she is convinced tax cuts are the way to help the economy grow, she isn't categorically ruling out direct support or 'handouts' to those who are vulnerable. She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become PM and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. Liz Truss says she wants to give people the power to ""keep
more of their own money"" and to bring in tax cuts to boost economic growth.
In aninterview with Londonâs Evening
Standard,external, the foreign secretary pledged to do ""all I can to
help"" people facing rises in their cost of living. If she becomes PM next month, Truss plans an emergency budget
and has said she would cancel the National Insurance rise, put forward by
former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, her leadership rival. She pledged, in her Standard interview: ""I can assure you that I will do all I can to
help households across Britain."" Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Gym owner Emily Wilkinson says she's facing a ""double
whammy"" of rising prices both at home and for her business, which is ""fighting
for survival"". Emily, who runs the gym with her husband in Macclesfield, says that just as her
company was recovering from Covid, she was hit with an energy bill for Â£1,000
per month, up from Â£480. ""That was in October 2021, six months before the energy
price cap increase. On 24 September, our electricity standing charge will
increase by 818% per day,"" she tells the BBC, urging the government to
take action to support small business owners. She says many businesses like hers can't risk passing on the price rise to
customers, who could go elsewhere. ""The general public think it's all over now Covid restrictions have been
dropped, but we feel like the fight is only just getting started,"" she
says. Chris PageIreland correspondent Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi says he ""will not rest"" until a way is found to deliver the Â£400 energy discount to households in Northern Ireland. Payments will begin in Great Britain in October, but there is uncertainty as to how the money can be distributed to people in Northern Ireland because of the current absence of the devolved government at Stormont. Zahawi has met two caretaker ministers in Belfast, and the local utilities regulator. Speaking afterwards on a visit to a business in Antrim, he said there had been a ""collective agreement we can do this"" and that a ""pragmatic solution"" was the way forward. He said he wanted to âkeep his promise"" that households in Northern Ireland would get their share of the money earmarked for the whole of the UK, and added that he wanted to be ""swift"". Read morehere. The UK is facing inflation of up to 13% in the coming months. But in the 1970s, inflation rapidly increased to
more than 25% due to rising oil prices and strong wage growth.Inflation was then brought largely under control
for the next few decades, despite some rises since 2008 related to the global
financial crisis and more recently the Covid pandemic. Last week, the Bank of England predicted that the cost of living could increase by more than 13% in the coming months, with high energy prices one of the
main reasons behind the rise. In addition to increased energy bills, consumers are also
having to deal with rising fuel prices. 
Although costs have dropped slightly from the record highs seen at the
beginning of July, current prices are still significantly higher than they were
at the start of the year. Michael RaceBusiness reporter Supermarkets are not cutting fuel prices by as much as they should to match the ""significant"" drop in the cost of wholesale fuel, the motoring group RAC says. It says the gap between pump prices and wholesale prices was the widest in almost a decade. The price of petrol on Tuesday was aboutÂ£1.76per litre, but RAC analysts suggested that after factoring in VAT, fuel duty and the ""generous"" retailer margin of 10p per litre, the price should be no more thanÂ£1.62. Fuel prices have hit record highs this year, but are slowly starting to fall. Energy customer Dallas Lucas has been speaking to the BBC,
saying the rise in energy prices has left her destitute. ""Right now Iâm sitting on a mattress in my flat, because I don't have a
bed or any furniture. I have been literally living on cereal and water, or
looking through bins for food. ""I've sold all my furniture. I don't have a washer or a
cooker anymore, just to try and keep up with the energy bills,"" she says. Dallas added that her gas bill had increased five-fold in recent
months, from Â£30 per month to Â£150. ""Bear in mind this is when we've had this massive heatwave, and my gas
hasn't been on."" She accused the government of ""playing Russian Roulette"" with people's

"England student loan interest rate capped at 6.3%Ministers say they want to provide support as prices rises, but analysts say it won't help students.","The interest rate on student loans in England and Wales is to be capped at 6.3% this autumn.

England's universities minister said she wanted to ""provide support"" amid the rising cost of living. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the change did ""nothing at all to protect current students"". Student loan interest rates will be reviewed again in December. The interest rate on the loan for those currently at university in England and Wales is calculated by adding 3% to the retail price index (RPI) - a measure of inflation which indicates the rate at which prices are rising.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicted the maximum rate on student loanswould jump from 4.5% to 12%from September this year.

Whale winched out of French river in rescue mission,"This video can not be played The whale was trapped for several days before the failed rescue mission A beluga whale that became stranded in France's Seine river had to be put down, ending a dramatic rescue mission that captivated world audiences. Officials say vets took the decision as the four-metre (13ft) mammal was being moved in a refrigerated truck. Overnight, rescuers spent nearly six hours lifting the 800kg (1,763lb) whale from the river using a crane and nets. They had planned to release the animal in the sea but its health deteriorated after failing to eat. ""It is with heavy hearts we announce that the beluga did not survive,"" Sea Shepherd France conservation group wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. ""We are devastated by this tragic outcome that we knew was very likely,"" it added. Meanwhile, Florence Ollivet-Courtois, a vet for the local emergency services, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that ""the animal was not getting enough air and [was] suffering visibly."" ""We therefore decided that it made no sense to set it free and proceeded to euthanasia,"" the vet added. Experts are still puzzled as to how the whale - who had been trapped more than 100km (62 miles) inland - managed to stray so far south, away from its natural habitat. On Wednesday, crowds were seen gathering on the banks of the river in the northern town of Saint-Pierre-La-Garenne to watch the rescue. But interest in the whale's survival spread far beyond France, and conservation groups and a number of individuals have made financial donations to help the rescue operation. Belugas occasionally venture south in the autumn to feed as ice forms, but it is rare for them to travel so far from their native home. According to France's Pelagis Observatory which specialises in sea mammals, the nearest beluga population is off the Svalbard archipelago, north of Norway, 3,000km (1,870 miles) from the Seine. But similar stories are not unheard of. In May,a killer whale was found dead after swimming up the River Seine in Normandy.And in 2019, adead whale was found in the River Thames near Gravesend, UK officials said.

Domino's pulls out of the birthplace of pizza,"This video can not be played Watch: 'Italian pizza is better for sure' - Italians respond to Domino's pulling out of country Domino's Pizza's last stores in Italy have been closed after the firm that operated its outlets in the country filed for bankruptcy, reports say. Franchise holder ePizza SpA was hit by the pandemic, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the story. Domino's had struggled to win over customers in the birthplace of pizza since launching there in 2015. News of the fast food giant's exit from the country was celebrated by some social media users. EPizza SpA first filed for bankruptcy in early April after it was impacted by coronavirus restrictions. ""The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent and prolonged restrictions from a financial point of view have seriously damaged ePizza,"" the company said. The company also said it faced increasing competition as traditional restaurants started using delivery apps. As part of the bankruptcy process the firm was granted protection from its creditors for 90 days. However, that protection came to an end last month. The Italian firm had already been scaling back the business from its peak in 2020, while deliveries stopped from the end of July. As of 2020, the company directly managed 23 outlets in Italy and another six stores were run through sub-franchising, according to the bankruptcy documents. In comparison, the UK and Ireland has more than 1,200 stores, making it the biggest Domino's market in Europe. The world's largest pizza chain has more than 18,300 stores in over 90 international markets globally, most of which are run as franchisees. When it entered Italy seven years ago Domino's aimed to stand out from the country's traditional pizza makers with a comprehensive home delivery service and a distinctive menu including US-style toppings like pineapple. However, it faced increasingly stiff competition during the pandemic as local restaurants signed up to food delivery platforms like Deliveroo and Just Eat. News that Domino's was leaving the home of pizza was cheered by some social media users. ""I've always wondered how Domino's could survive in New Jersey, let alone Italy,"" journalist Dave Jamieson tweeted. Another Twitter user, Alicia Smith, remarked that opening Domino's in Italy islike trying to sell snow in the North Pole,external.

""It is with heavy hearts we announce that the beluga did not survive,"" Sea Shepherd France conservation group wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. ""We are devastated by this tragic outcome that we knew was very likely,"" it added. Meanwhile, Florence Ollivet-Courtois, a vet for the local emergency services, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that ""the animal was not getting enough air and [was] suffering visibly."" ""We therefore decided that it made no sense to set it free and proceeded to euthanasia,"" the vet added. Experts are still puzzled as to how the whale - who had been trapped more than 100km (62 miles) inland - managed to stray so far south, away from its natural habitat. On Wednesday, crowds were seen gathering on the banks of the river in the northern town of Saint-Pierre-La-Garenne to watch the rescue. But interest in the whale's survival spread far beyond France, and conservation groups and a number of individuals have made financial donations to help the rescue operation. Belugas occasionally venture south in the autumn to feed as ice forms, but it is rare for them to travel so far from their native home. According to France's Pelagis Observatory which specialises in sea mammals, the nearest beluga population is off the Svalbard archipelago, north of Norway, 3,000km (1,870 miles) from the Seine. But similar stories are not unheard of. In May,a killer whale was found dead after swimming up the River Seine in Normandy.And in 2019, adead whale was found in the River Thames near Gravesend, UK officials said.
