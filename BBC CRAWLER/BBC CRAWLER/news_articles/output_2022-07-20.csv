Farmer who hid murdered wife in septic tank jailed,"This video can not be played Brenda Venables' family ""will never forgive"" her husband for killing her A retired farmer who murdered his wife before concealing her remains in a septic tank has been jailed for life.ââââââââââââââ Brenda Venables vanished from the home she shared with her husband David in Kempsey, Worcestershire, in 1982. Her remains were found inside the tank on the couple's farm in 2019 and Venables was charged with her murder. During his trial it was revealed Venables, now 89, killed his wife after rekindling a longstanding affair. On Wednesday at Worcester Crown Court, High Court Judge Mrs Justice Tipples ruled he must serve a minimum of 18 years. The 40-year mystery of the missing farmer's wife The pensioner had taken advantage of his wife's depression to create a ""carefully thought-out story"" that she had left home in the middle of the night, apparently to take her own life, the judge told him. Mrs Venables had a ""cheerful and kind nature"" her family said Jurors heard how Venables had seemed emotionless when his wife of 22 years went missing and he continued to show no emotion throughout the trial. A police investigation after Mrs Venables was reported missing on 4 May 1982 had failed to find any trace of her. Her decayed remains were not discovered until July 2019, five years after Venables had moved out of Quaking House Farm where they had lived together. The new owners wanted the tank serviced and an engineer discovered remnants of her clothing, a clump of hair and a human skull. After tests determined the remains were those of Mrs Venables, her husband was charged with her murder. David Venables killed his wife Brenda after rekindling an affair with another woman Mrs Venables' disappearance was reported in the Worcester News During his trial, details of his double life were revealed as prosecutors told how he had been in a long-term on-off relationship with his mother's carer Lorraine Styles since around 1967. Despite her death in 2017, a statement Mrs Styles had given to police in 1984 was read to the court which described him as being ""quite composed"" about his wife going missing. Jurors heard the evidence showed he had used a manhole cover to weigh down his wife's body. The judge also rejected defence claims that the killing had been carried out in the heat of the moment, telling Venables the whole process of disposing of the body in the septic tank, and then leaving no trace, must have required considerable planning. The remains were found during a clearing of the septic tank ""Your complete lack of respect for Brenda is obvious from your decision to dispose of her body in the septic tank,"" Mrs Justice Tipples told him. ""The fact that is what you did with her body is disgusting and repulsive."" Addressing the motive for the killing, she said: ""I am sure you killed Brenda Venables to remove her from your life and the complications she may have presented to you in any divorce proceedings. ""There is no doubt an element of greed and selfishness."" Venables was convicted of murder and sentenced for spend at least 18 years in prison It took the jury 16 hours and 43 minutes over four days to convict Venables, of Elgar Drive, Kempsey, of Brenda's murder. After the retired farmer's conviction, her family spoke of how they wished she had been able to leave her marriage. ""We feel utter horror and despair that Brenda was murdered,"" they said. ""She was no harm to anyone, being a gentle and increasingly quiet woman. At the time of her disappearance, her devastated elderly parents never gave up hope that she would return, they said. Brenda Venables' remains were found in 2019 In a statement after the sentencing, her family said: ""We recall her father Harold watching the garden path in hope of Brenda coming to see them. ""He died heartbroken two and a half years later."" The thought Brenda lay undiscovered for more than 37 years while the septic tank continued to be used ""is simply unthinkable,"" they added. Reading out the tribute on the family's behalf, Det Con Claire Masters of West Mercia Police, said: ""We will never be able to forgive David Venables for what he did and for not telling us the truth.""

Teens turn to TikTok and Instagram for news,"Teenagers are increasingly consuming news via platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, according to Ofcom More teenagers are turning away from traditional media outlets and getting their news from social media, new research from Ofcom has shown. The number of people consuming news content on TikTok has increased from 800,000 in 2020 to 3.9 million in 2022. For the first time, Instagram is the most popular news source among younger people - used by 29% of teens in 2022 - with TikTok and YouTube close behind. But print, TV and radio news outlets still dominate in older age groups. The growth in news consumed via TikTok is being driven mainly by younger age groups - half of users consuming news on the platform are aged 16-24. The number of people consuming news via the video sharing platform is now similar to the number using the Sky News website and app, Ofcom said. TikTok users who took part in the study said they get more of their news from ""other people they follow"" (47%) than from news organisations' own accounts (24%). Increasingly, news stories also originate on the platform. Earlier this week, a video showing a student being harassed by a man on a Cardiff street waswatched more than two million timesand picked up by news outlets. And the recent high-profile libel case between Amber Heard and Johnny Deppdominated the video sharing platform,with many users watching the proceedings unfold live on YouTube before selecting clips to share with their followers on TikTok. Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom's group director for strategy and research, said in a statement that teenagers nowadays are ""increasingly unlikely to pick up a newspaper or tune into TV news"", preferring to stay informed by ""scrolling through their social feeds"". ""And while youngsters find news on social media to be less reliable, they rate these services more highly for serving up a range of opinions on the day's topical stories,"" he added. Despite its newfound popularity though, less than a third of young people (30%) asked in the study said they actually trusted the news content they found through TikTok. On Instagram, the BBC was the most followed outlet for users who consume news on the platform, with a 45% reach. Sky News (22%), the Lad Bible and Buzzfeed (both14%) also performed well on the platform. Around 60% of Instagram users who consume news said they followed a public figure, while 44% said they followed at least one specific journalist. That teenagers are using Instagram and TikTok for news is probably not a surprise. It was perhaps more surprising that, right up until 2020, BBC One remained their number one source of news and still remains top of the list for ""most important source"". The research shows 59% say they still watch some news on TV. However, for anyone interested in which news sources are most influential, this new research makes interesting reading. The decline of printed newspapers has been apparent for many years, but the drop in the last two years has been startling. In 2020, 35% of the population (the vast majority over the age of 55) were still reading a paper, but that's now dropped to 24% - a drop of almost a third. It appears deliveries and popping out for a paper are some of the former daily habits which were disrupted by Covid. And for those hoping digital readership was replacing print, it's not good news. Online reach for newspaper websites also dropped slightly (from 20% to 19% of the population). However, it's worth noting that this misses out a crucial part of the news landscape. The news agenda is still, in many ways, driven by what appears on front pages and news websites. Instagram and TikTok are popular platforms for news, but the stories themselves often have their origins in what used to be called Fleet Street. And what's easily forgotten is that the biggest source of news for teens isn't Instagram but their families (65%), and mum or dad are probably not relying on TikTok just yet. The Ofcom report also shows an acceleration in the decline in consumption of traditional outlets, particularly among young people. BBC One and BBC Two, previously the most popular news sources among teenagers, have been knocked off the top spot and are now down in fifth place. Just under a quarter (24%) of those asked used the those channels to find news last year, compared with almost half (45%) five years ago. For adults in the UK the picture is a little different however, as BBC One remains the most used news source. A BBC spokesman said: ""According to this Ofcom research the BBC is the most used news source for 12-15 year olds - via TV, radio, and online - and young people are also consuming BBC News on social media platforms such as our hugely popular Instagram account."" Sales of physical newspapers have fallen further in the last two years as daily habits were disrupted by Covid lockdowns TV news generally remains the most trusted source among most (71%) adults, with news on social media deemed to be the least reliable (35%). CNN (83%) was found to be the most trusted of the all the news channels, with Sky News (75%) in second place and the BBC (73%) in third, followed closely by ITV (70%). Sixty-seven percent of newcomer GB News's viewers said they trusted its reporting. There is still a trend for traditional networks like BBC, ITV and Sky News being in general decline in terms of overall viewing figures, which are now below pre-pandemic levels. Readership of print and online newspapers among adults (38%) also declined again this year, the study suggested, with a significant decrease from 2020 (47%) and 2018 (51%). When the newspapers' online presence was removed, those consuming news solely from physical papers also declined from 35% in 2020 to 24% in 2022. The use of newspapers among teenagers fell from 19% to 13% in the past five years. Trolls target woman harassed in TikTok video.

New nuclear power plant gets go-ahead,"The planned Sizewell C plant is expected to cost about Â£20bn The government has given the go-ahead for the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. The project, mainly funded by the French energy company EDF, is expected to cost in the region of Â£20bn. The company said the new plant would generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. Campaigners Stop Sizewell C said they ""will be looking closely at appealing this decision"". The new plant would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF said the new two-reactor plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Negotiations with the government on raising funds for the project are continuing and a decision on the finances is expected in 2023. Sizewell C would be built just south of RSPB Minsmere Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed the development consent and central government will make all future planning decisions on the plant as it is deemed to be a nationally significant infrastructure project. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in May 2020. The secretary of state overrode recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate not to grant the go-ahead for the scheme unless issues on water supplies and nature were resolved. In its report, the examining authority said it recommended,externalthat ""unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out"". The inspectorate's chief executive, Sarah Richards, said: ""This examination took place during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, and the examining authority worked hard to ensure that local people, the local authorities - East Suffolk District Council and Suffolk County Council - and other interested parties were able to fully participate."" Tom McGarry, head of regional affairs at EDF Energy, said the company would ""proceed with humility"" Tom McGarry, EDF's head of regional affairs, said the company would ""proceed with humility"". ""Regardless of where you stand on the project, I think everybody is pleased that we have arrived at a decision now,"" he said. ""What we have to make sure is that we work with the local communities to minimise construction when it begins and all throughout and also maximise the opportunities for Suffolk."" How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Campaigners knock government over Sizewell figures Government to take 20% stake in new nuclear plant The government has committed Â£100m to developing the project and planned to take a 20% stake in the plant. Local anti-nuclear campaigners have objected to the plant on several grounds, including that it would be built next to the RSPB's Minsmere nature reserve and have a negative effect on wildlife. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C said Sizewell would be turned into the ""biggest building site in Europe"" and it would drive tourists away The campaign group Stop Sizewell C said it would continue to oppose the project and would be trying to find grounds to appeal against the decision. Alison Downes, from the group, said: ""We are going to continue challenging this project because of technical concerns, impacts on the environment, the investors, the fact that households are going to have to pay, the huge expense and potential for massive delays."" She claimed people in the local area were ""devastated"" by the latest decision. ""They're absolutely resolute and steadfast with us and our campaign to keep fighting against this damaging project,"" she said. ""This is going to be turned into the biggest building site in Europe and that will drive tourists and a lot of people who could make this a prosperous region away."" Sizewell C, on the right, would be built next to Sizewell B, centre, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, far left, which operated until 2006 and is being decommissioned East Suffolk Council is the local planning authority, but does not make decisions on Sizewell because of its national importance. The Conservative-run council said it would review the development consent over the coming weeks. Craig Rivett, deputy leader and cabinet member for economic development said they would work with the project stakeholders and the local community ""to ensure that appropriate mitigation is in place to help lessen the impacts of the project during the construction phase"". Suffolk County Council said it was ""disappointed that a number of key issues have not been fully resolved"" including ""the blight"" of additional pylons no reference to removing a Sizewell link road once construction was completed. The council added that Suffolk would benefit from nearly Â£200m of investment to mitigate the impact on communities, the environment and infrastructure and that a ""far greater quantity of construction materials will be delivered by rail and sea, reducing the number of lorries on the county's rural roads"". However the GMB, which represents workers in the energy sector, said Sizewell C's approval was ""a vital step forward for energy and net-zero"". Anti-nuclear campaigners protesting on the beach in the shadow of the decommissioned Sizewell A, which generated electricity between 1966 and 2006 By Esme Stallard, BBC Science and Climate Change reporter The UK government plans to completely decarbonise the country's electricity by 2035. This means that all our electricity will be produced from renewable or low-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear. Up to 24GW of nuclear-generated electricity is planned by 2050,external- this is three times more than we have now and could provide up to 25% of our required electricity demand. The other 75% would therefore have to come from other forms of renewable or low-carbon. All but one of the UK's existing nuclear power plants are due to stop generating by 2030, and begin the lengthy decommissioning process. The government is aware of the need to accelerate plans to meet its decarbonising targets. And, therefore, of making a decision on Sizewell C. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also said that expanding the use of nuclear would help resist ""bullying"" from Russia, which dominates the European gas market, and build energy independence by providing a stable energy supply. The energy produced from other low-carbon sources like solar and wind vary with the weather, until there is further development of energy storage technology. Although nuclear is one of the greenest forms of energy -  as measured by amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced per unit of energy - there are still some emissions associated with manufacturing the steel and other materials needed. And the long-term environmental consequences of dealing with and storing nuclear waste remain unclear. The Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) said it ""hoped that many of the project benefits, claimed by the developer, would come to fruition"" such as new jobs, low carbon electricity generation and development of habitats to make up for the loss of land. Chairman of the AONB Partnership, Nick Collinson, said: ""This part of England has been designated for its nature, tranquillity and scenic quality, much of which will be lost or damaged during the 9-12 year construction. ""The partnership will of course work constructively with EDF to ensure mitigation and compensation is maximised to minimise the damage to this special part of the world."" Campaign group, Greenpeace, called the project an ""expensive white elephant"" that was ""trashing an important nature reserve"". Its chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: ""Rather than wasting time and money on this red herring energy solution, the government should throw everything at making cheaper, cleaner and more reliable renewables the backbone of our energy system."" Correction 21 July 2022: This piece has been updated to clarify that the Planning Inspectorate recommended against granting permission unless issues on water supplies and nature were resolved.

Tesla sells most of its Bitcoin holdings,"Tesla, which made waves last year when it revealed a major investment in Bitcoin, has now sold off most of its holdings of the cryptocurrency. The electric car firm has offloaded 75% of its Bitcoin, which was worth about $2bn (Â£1.7bn) at the end of 2021. It is backing away as the value of the cryptocurrency has plunged, falling by more than 50% this year. Tesla said it bought traditional currency with the $936m (Â£782m) from its Bitcoin sales. Tesla boss Elon Musk has been among the most high profile champions of cryptocurrency, with his pronouncements on social media often driving significant trading activity. Tesla's $1.5bn investment in Bitcoin, revealed in February 2021,prompted a surge of demand in the currency.The price of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency soared last year to almost $70,000 in November before crashing. One Bitcoin now trades for less than $25,000. Tesla profits soar as customers pay more Tesla deliveries at record high despite challenges Tesla starts accepting once-joke currency Dogecoin Tesla last year stopped accepting Bitcoin as payment for its cars, citing concerns about the climate impact of energy-intensive Bitcoin mining. At the time, Mr Musk said on social media,externalthat the company would not be selling the Bitcoin it owned. Last year, Elon Musk took to Twitter to outline Tesla's position on Bitcoin. ""Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin"". That sounds pretty emphatic. Yet from the mouth of the world's richest person, statements should be taken with not just a pinch but a shovel of salt. We now know that a year after that Tweet, Tesla sold most of its Bitcoin. You might be noticing a pattern here? Whether it's promising driverless tech or buying social media companies, Mr Musk's pronouncements don't always come to pass. That doesn't seem to have hurt his business career, up to now. But this is another reminder that his words, which can move markets, are not set in stone. The move is yet more bad news for Bitcoin and crypto more generally. Musk is an advocate of crypto, and helped hype up currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Mr Musk said that this wasn't a reflection on Bitcoin, and more about the need for cash. However, he also called crypto a ""side show to the side show"". Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Tesla shared the sale of the holdings as part of its regular quarterly update. It said Bitcoin was one of the factors that hurt its profitability. However, the company reported higher-than-expected profit for the three months to the end of June as price increases of its best-selling cars helped offset challenges, including lockdowns in China. It also promised a ""record-breaking second half"" to the year. Tesla said production at its factory in China rose to a monthly record as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. Mr Musk also said output increased at the company's newer factories in Germany and the US. He previously called the sites in Berlin and Austin, Texas""gigantic money furnaces"".

EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-off,"The European Commission has urged countries across the bloc to cut their gas use by 15% from August to March amid fears Russia could halt supplies. It says the target is voluntary but will become legally binding if Moscow turns off the taps this summer. The key Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany has been offline for maintenance for 10 days and is due to be turned back on this Thursday. But there are concerns Moscow will not follow through on its promise. Adding to the uncertainty, Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that it was not clear whether or in what condition a turbine from the pipeline would be returned in after repairs in Canada. The Russian president said there was a risk the equipment would have to be switched off at ""some point"" and Nord Stream 1 would be shut down. Russia supplied Europe with 40% of its natural gas last year, with Germany the continent's largest importer in 2020, followed by Italy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a Europe-wide cut-off was now a ""likely scenario"". ""Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,"" she said. ""Therefore, in any event, whether it's a partial, major cut-off of Russian gas or a total cut-off of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready."" EU energy rationing can't be ruled out, Shell says Germany takes step closer to gas rationing Since Russia invaded Ukraine it has cut supplies to a number of countries which have rejected its demand for payment for gas in roubles, including Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. It has also been accused of reducing supplies to make it more difficult for EU countries to build up reserves ahead of winter. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in global markets. The Commission said a full cut-off during winter could have a major impact on EU economies, reducing growth by up to 1.5%. The International Monetary Fund last week warned it could plunge countries into recession, heightening an energy crisis that has sent consumer bills soaring. European nations have been trying to build up gas storage ahead of winter in case Moscow further restricts supplies. The proposed 15% reduction is compared with average consumption in the same period from 2016 to 2021. The gas that is saved would be put into storage, Ms von der Leyentweeted,external. ""This is a big ask for the whole of the EU - but it is necessary to protect us,"" she said. She said that some member states are ""more vulnerable"" to gas supply disruption, and that EU states ""all need to be ready to share gas"". The plan has hit resistance from Poland, which has filled its gas storage to 98% of capacity and does not feel the need to cut its use. Other countries have less stored - Hungary, for example, is at 47% of capacity. The European Commission suggested measures governments could take to cut gas use, including compensating industries that use less and limiting heating and cooling temperatures in public buildings. Governments should also decide the order in which they would force industries to shut down in the event of a supply emergency. Households are classed as ""protected consumers"" under EU rules and would be shielded from such curbs. EU member states will vote on the Council's rationing plan at a meeting of energy ministers on 26 July. Germany has already been taking steps towards gas rationing. In June the country triggered the ""alarm"" stage ofan emergency gas plan to deal with shortages. On Monday the International Energy Agency (IEA) called on European countries to further reduce gas consumption, saying Russia's latest moves to restrict gas flows, along with other supply disruptions, are a ""red alert"" to the EU. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said that despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas, it hasn't been enough to prevent Europe ""finding itself in an incredibly precarious position today"", adding that the next few months were ""critical"".

Busiest day since WW2 for London firefighters,"This video can not be played London wildfires: Family home of 27 years destroyed London's fire service had its busiest day since World War Two dealing with multiple blazes in record-breaking temperatures on Tuesday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. The capital was one of 15 areas around the UK to declare a major incident. The fires started on a day which saw a record temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Wednesday has been cooler for most but thunderstorms are forecast in central England. A yellow warning has been issued by the Met Office for heavy showers and thunderstorms which could bring disruption in eastern and south-east England on Wednesday evening. Despite falling temperatures, the weather iscontinuing to affect transport, with Network Rail advising passengers to only travel if necessary. By mid-afternoon LNER services from London to Scotland were starting up again, while trains on the East Coast Mainline resumed after a fire in Bedfordshire. Around 100 firefighters tackled a fire which destroyed homes in Wennington The fires occurred during record-breaking temperatures in the UK Images show extensive damage to buildings in the village of Wennington on the outskirts of east London Mr Khan said London Fire Brigade (LFB) received 2,600 calls as it dealt with multiple fires. He earlier told Sky News 41 properties were destroyed in London on Tuesday. In Wennington, east London, 100 firefighterstackled a blaze which destroyed several homes. LFB said two rows of terraced houses, four other homes, 12 stables and five cars were destroyed by the blaze, while one firefighter at the scene described it as ""absolute hell"". Dramatic images from the scene showed smoke billowing from buildings, some with their roofs collapsed, and extensive damage to the surrounding land. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Khan said: ""Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War. ""Normally we get 350 calls a day, on a busy day we can get up to 500 calls. Yesterday the fire service had more than 2,600 calls a day."" Are soaring temperatures linked to climate change? Is your area vulnerable to extreme heat? Check the forecast where you are The mayor has advised Londoners not to have barbecues in parks or private gardens over concerns they could set alight grass. LFB assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said he had not seen anything like the ""sheer scale across the whole of London"" as the brigade dealt with 15 major fires, and a large number of wildfires and grassland fires. The heat and dry conditions created ""the perfect scenario"" for fires to spread rapidly across grassland and woodland, with the speed a particular challenge, he said. Speaking in Wennington, he said the brigade had never before asked firefighters to operate when the temperature outside was 40C. ""We're obviously thinking very carefully about how we can be even better prepared as we move forward, because what we do know is that climate change is going to continue to pose challenges for us.""

At Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson thanked firefighters and said he had spoken with the chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council. LFB said 16 firefighters had heat-related injuries - two of whom were taken to hospital but have since been discharged. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue saidfour from their crews had been taken to hospitalbut have made a full recovery. Speaking after PMQs, Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse told MPs some of the pressure would now ease as the ""fiercest heat has subsided"" but he warned the summer was likely to bring further hot weather and the risk of wildfire remained elevated. ""That is why we are treating this heatwave as an exacting test of our national resilience and contingency planning,"" he said. Tim Stock alerted the fire brigade when he saw flames near his home in Wennington. Mr Stock, whose house was destroyed, told BBC Radio 5 Live he and his son had spotted the fire in his neighbour's garden but, despite their best efforts with a hose and watering can, had been unable to stop it spreading. ""I reckon about 15 to 20 houses might be gone or uninhabitable,"" he said. ""My house is completely gone, as is the next door neighbour's and three or four other houses along that bit."" Six houses were engulfed in flames in Barnsley The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has accused government spending cuts of hampering the fire service's ability to react. Matt Wrack, the union's general secretary, said firefighters were ""at the forefront of the climate emergency"" but, while the demands of the job were increasing, their resources had been cut by government for over a decade with 11,500 firefighter jobs cut since 2010. Speaking about the LFB, Mr Khan said he inherited closed fire stations, cancelled engines and firefighters losing jobs when he took over as mayor from Boris Johnson. He said he has been rebuilding the capital's fire service with kit and more firefighters. Phil Garrigan, who leads the National Resilience group for the National Fire Chiefs Council, said the UK must now consider what equipment it had to fight wildfires. He said most European countries where significant wildfires occur have planes or helicopters which can collect or distribute water to areas where fire is developing. Meanwhile,Just Stop Oil demonstrators climbed motorway signs on the M25, near Cobham, Surrey, to protest at the extreme temperatures in the UK. Police closed sections of the motorway and at one stage there were five-mile traffic queues approaching junction 30 in Essex, National Highways said. Just Stop Oil protesters climbed gantries over the M25 The latest Met Office provisional figures show that Scotland's record-breaking highest temperature, hit on Tuesday, washigher than first thought, with 35.1C registered at Floors Castle in Kelso. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change, and that hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Met Office chief scientist Prof Stephen Belcher said Tuesday's temperatures were striking due to the large record-breaking margin and the extensive area of the UK experiencing the severe temperatures. But ""aggressive emissions cuts"" could very sharply reduce the frequency of extreme temperatures, he told BBC News. Were you affected by Tuesday's fires?

Sunak and Truss final two in race to be PM,"Rishi Sunak will face Liz Truss in the race to be the next prime minister, after Penny Mordaunt was eliminated in the latest Tory leadership ballot. Ms Truss overturned Ms Mordaunt's narrow lead in the final vote among Tory MPs, securing a place in the run-off by 113 votes to 105. She will now go head-to-head with Mr Sunak, who topped the final ballot with 137 votes. The winner will be decided by a vote among Conservative party members. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss secured her place after a late surge in support, picking up 27 votes in the 24 hours since the last round whilst Ms Mordaunt only gained 13. The two had been scrambling to secure the backing of MPs who had backed Kemi Badenoch, who was knocked out in Tuesday's vote. Policy guide: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss Amol Rajan: Why newspapers matter more in race to be next PM Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a Truss supporter, said her campaign had ""come with momentum at the end"". He added that her stance on post-Brexit regulatory reforms and plans to help those on low incomes had convinced colleagues to back her. The campaign for Mr Sunak, the former chancellor, said his 137 votes were a ""really strong result with a clear mandate from MPs"". Speaking to broadcasters, he said he was ""humbled"" to be in the final two, and said he was best-placed to ""beat Keir Starmer at the next election"". Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt ran a campaign emphasising her support for Brexit and her ability to win Labour-held seats for the Tories. Although she briefly served in Theresa May's cabinet, she has only held more junior positions under Mr Johnson and has boosted her profile considerably having started as one of the lesser-known candidates. Tory MP George Freeman, one of her supporters, said she had come ""from nowhere to fight a great campaign"". ""We have lit a flame she is not going away,"" he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: I want to be honest about challenges we face Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the cabinet mutiny against Boris Johnson, has repeatedly clashed with Ms Truss over economic policy during the leadership campaign. Ms Truss has promised to introduce Â£38bn of tax cuts if she wins power, including scrapping April's rise in National Insurance, introduced by the government whilst Mr Sunak was still at the Treasury. She has also pledged to cancel planned corporation tax rises from April 2023, which Mr Sunakannounced in March last year. But Mr Sunak has rubbished her proposals, saying the tax rises are needed to repair the public finances after Covid and accusing her of peddling ""something-for-nothing economics"". He has said he wants to lower the tax burden, but this should only be done when inflation, currently running at its highest level for 40 years, has been brought under control. Before Ms Mordaunt was knocked out, Sir Keir Starmer criticised the remaining contenders for making ""unfunded"" tax pledges worth billions of pounds. Speaking atBoris Johnson's final Prime Minister's Questions,the Labour leader also said the leadership rivals had not had a ""single decent thing to say"" about the current government's record. ""I think the message coming out of this leadership contest is pretty clear - they got us into this mess, and they've no idea how to get us out of it,"" he added. This video can not be played I've run a positive campaign, says Liz Truss Although Mr Sunak has come first in all the voting rounds among Tory MPs, surveys have suggested he may struggle to maintain his advantage among members. A YouGov survey of 725 party members on Monday and Tuesday suggested Mr Sunak would lose to either Ms Mordaunt or Ms Truss in a head-to-head. The poll had Ms Mordaunt beating Mr Sunak by 51% to 37% and Ms Truss beating him by 54% to 35%. A dozen regional hustings for members will take place between 28 July and 31 August, beginning in Leeds. Before that, Ms Truss and Mr Sunak will also go head-to-head during alive debate on BBC One next Monday. The pair declined to take part in a live debate on Sky News earlier this week,leading to its cancellation, but have now agreed to take part in a debate hosted by the broadcaster on 4 August. The roughly 160,000 Conservative members will then vote by post or online between early August and 2 September, with a winner announced on 5 September. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut?

Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary,"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job,"Nineteen months after he first entered Downing Street as PM, Rishi Sunak faces the fight of his political life to hang on to the job. Four Conservative prime ministers had already come and gone when, at the age of 42, just seven years an MP, he was tasked with keeping the Tory show on the road. The MPs who put him there hoped he would steady the ship after turbulent times under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, before mounting a comeback for the party trailing a long way behind Labour in the opinion polls. So farthat comeback has yet to materialise. With a general election having to be called by January 2025, the assumption was that Mr Sunak would play it long and go to the country in the autumn, in the hope his political fortunes would eventually pick up. His surprise calling of an election on 4 July has left some some Conservative MPs scratching their heads but his allies insist it was a smart move. The youngest occupant of No 10 in modern times, Mr Sunak is also the first British-Indian to be prime minister. A son of first generation immigrants, who worked hard to send him to one of the country's top fee-paying schools, Winchester College, where he was head boy. He spent time in California and worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs - and two multibillion dollar hedge funds - before entering politics. Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife? A self-confessed ""huge Star Wars fan"" with a sizeable collection of lightsabers, he is sometimes portrayed as a ""geek"". He generally swears off alcohol in favour of Mexican Coca-Cola, which, he says, is made with ""cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup"". Colleagues describe him as a details man, who is always the best-briefed person in any meeting. He became prime minister in extraordinary circumstances after his predecessor Liz Truss - whom he lost to in a leadership contest after the collapse of Boris Johnson's premiership - quitafter just 45 days in the job. Age:44 Place of birth:Southampton, Hampshire Home:London and Yorkshire Education:Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University Family:Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters Parliamentary constituency:Richmond (Yorkshire) This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says that when it comes to helping the most vulnerable ""that's what I did"". Mr Sunak's parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. He was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP, and his mother ran her own pharmacy. ""In terms of cultural upbringing, I'd be at the temple at the weekend - I'm a Hindu - but I'd also be at [Southampton Football Club] the Saints game as well on a Saturday - you do everything, you do both."" In the interview he said he had been fortunate not to have endured a lot of racism growing up, but that there was one incident that had stayed with him. ""I was just out with my younger brother and younger sister, and I think, probably pretty young, I was probably a mid-teenager, and we were out at a fast food restaurant and I was just looking after them. There were people sitting nearby, it was the first time I'd experienced it, just saying some very unpleasant things. The 'P' word. ""And it stung. I still remember it. It seared in my memory. You can be insulted in many different ways."" However, he said he ""can't conceive of that happening today"" in the UK. He attended Winchester College and worked as a waiter at a Southampton curry house during his summer holidays. After finishing school he went on to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics, before studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. There he met his wife, and the couple have two daughters. His rise to the top of British politics has been rapid - he only became an MP in 2015, in the rock solid Conservative seat of Richmond, in North Yorkshire. His political opponents have made much of his personal wealth, claiming he is out touch with the lives of most voters. Together, he and hiswife Akshata Murty- daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, who co-founder of IT services giant Infosys - havean estimated worth of more than Â£650m. In 2022, Ms Murty announced she wouldstart paying UK tax on her incometo relieve political pressure on her husband. He was arguing for Britain's departure from the EU from his earliest days in politics and supported the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But he first came to wider public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, when as the recently-appointed chancellor he spent eye-watering sums on the furlough scheme and other support measures, as well as launching the controversial Eat Out to Help Out scheme. His personal popularity soared but he also got caught up in the Partygate controversies that rocked Downing Street, being fined, in June 2020, for attending one of the now infamous gatherings. And he found himself increasingly at odds with his boss Boris Johnson over the economy - pushing for lower taxes and spending cuts. In July 2022, he resigned from the cabinet, a move that was instrumental in ousting Mr Johnson, which some of the former PM's allies have not forgotten. He was not elected leader by Conservative Party members. He was, in effect, crowned by Tory grandees desperate for some stability after the chaos presided over by Liz Truss and latterly by Boris Johnson. He inherited a financial crisis and a party in disarray but also a near 70-seat majority - which has since been significantly eroded by a series of by-election defeats featuring big swings against his party. At the start of 2023, Mr Sunak set out five promises to voters, he wanted to be judged by: Halving inflation Growing the economy Reducing debt Cutting NHS waiting times Stopping small boat crossings Progress on thesehas been slow. The overall number of patients waiting for treatment on the NHS is higher than when Mr Sunak came to office, but inflation has dropped sharply in recent months. The headline rate for the year to April was 2.3%, hailed by the prime minister as a ""major moment"" - and a clear sign that his economic plan is working. On small boats, the government passed legislation allowing it to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but this was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. The government responded by signing a new treaty with Rwanda, declaring it a safe country. This became law in April and the prime minister argues it will deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Critics have dismissed it as a hugely expensive gimmick. Mr Sunakhas now said no asylum seekers will be flown to Rwanda before the election - and will go there only if he is re-elected. He has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. seeking to portray himself as the friend of the motorist and voters who are unhappy about the personal sacrifices required to reach the net zero target. He also scaled back the HS2 high speed rail link. Mr Sunak has pledged to create a ""smoke-free generation"" by phasing out the sale of tobacco products. The billcould fall by the wayside with Parliament shutting down on Fridaybut it is likely to be in the Conservative manifesto. The prime minister's personal ratings have suffered as series of resets has not had the desired effect on Tory fortunes, but he insists he can defy the odds and retain the keys to Downing Street on 4 July.

"Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year highThe prices of fuel and food climbed in June, latest figures show.BusinessComments","Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, while costs for milk, cheese and eggs also climbed, the ONS said. Unions have been calling for pay rises to help workers cope as the rising cost of living eats into household budgets. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by the European Union to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices stood at 184p per litre in June, the ONS said, the highest since records began in 1990 and up from 129.7p a year earlier. The monthly rise was also the largest on record. The average price of diesel in June was 192.4p per litre, again a record high, the ONS said. It led to the said average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel were leading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Elsewhere, food prices have been climbing, with costs increasing at the fastest rate since March 2009.

Your device may not support this visualisation Research firm Kantar has predicted supermarket bills are set to rise by an average of Â£454 this year. This comes as energy bills, which rose by an unprecedented Â£700 a year in April for a typical household, are forecast to climb again in October.

Christine and Mel Simpson fear how bad inflation will get this winter Christine and Mel Simpson from Derby receive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" Mel told the BBC. Meanwhile, Rachel, who uses the Community Pantry on Hurst Farm in Derbyshire where you pay Â£5 for membership and can do a shop worth about Â£50, said the service had made a massive difference for her family, especially after she lost her job as a childminder during the pandemic.

Other countries around the world are also experiencing a cost of living squeeze, with many affected by the same global factors as the UK. However, the UK's inflation rate is currently higher than then US and others in Europe, with the latest estimates of annual inflation for Germany at 8.2% and for France at 6.5%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the two main causes of inflation globally were surging energy prices and worker shortages. But he said: ""The euro-zone has the first factor but not really the second. The US has the second factor, but not really the first. The UK has both. That's why inflation is highest in the UK."" EU governments had also ""done more to prevent"" higher wholesale gas and electricity prices being passed onto households, he added. And while the UK's labour market was ""just as tight as in the US"", it appeared UK workers were ""more able to bargain for higher wages"", which could fuel further inflation. Mr Dales said the ""combined influence"" of Brexit and the pandemic had resulted in shortages of workers, due to fewer workers coming to the UK from overseas and a greater share of people of working age ""have either become unable to work or decided they no longer want to or need to work"". As Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in his Mansion House speech on Tuesday night, the inflationary pressures on the economy are no longer just global, they are domestic too. The labour force has shrunk, making it harder to recruit and pushing up wages. ""This increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressure, "" he said. The headline inflation rate in the UK is already the highest of the advanced G7 economies. And much criticism has come the Bank of England's way in the Conservative leadership campaign. But labour shortages are far more directly under government policy control and yet they are barely being discussed in the leadership debate. The higher rates of inflation will make the conversation with public sector workers yet more tense. And all roads appear to lead to a rise in base interest rates next month of half a percentage point - the biggest rise in nearly three decades. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the Bank of England to ""bear down on inflation"". ""Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK,"" he said. But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said rising inflation could push family finances ""to the brink"" after a decade of slow wage growth. ""It's the result of a decade of Tory mismanagement of our economy meaning living standards and real wages have failed to grow,"" she said. On Tuesday, the government announced that the police and most NHS staff would get below-inflation pay rises. It has consistently said that big wage increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up causing a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", but Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the announcements were ""a kick in the teeth"". Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said rising prices were ""wiping out pay increases"", adding there ""cost of living crisis is only worsening"". The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said rates could rise by as much as 0.5 percentage points at its next rates meeting in August in a bid to stem rising prices. That would take them to 1.75%.

Farmer who hid murdered wife in septic tank jailedDavid Venables killed his wife Brenda 40 years ago and her remains lay undiscovered for decades.Hereford & Worcester,"This video can not be played Brenda Venables' family ""will never forgive"" her husband for killing her A retired farmer who murdered his wife before concealing her remains in a septic tank has been jailed for life.ââââââââââââââ Brenda Venables vanished from the home she shared with her husband David in Kempsey, Worcestershire, in 1982. Her remains were found inside the tank on the couple's farm in 2019 and Venables was charged with her murder. During his trial it was revealed Venables, now 89, killed his wife after rekindling a longstanding affair. On Wednesday at Worcester Crown Court, High Court Judge Mrs Justice Tipples ruled he must serve a minimum of 18 years. The 40-year mystery of the missing farmer's wife The pensioner had taken advantage of his wife's depression to create a ""carefully thought-out story"" that she had left home in the middle of the night, apparently to take her own life, the judge told him. Mrs Venables had a ""cheerful and kind nature"" her family said Jurors heard how Venables had seemed emotionless when his wife of 22 years went missing and he continued to show no emotion throughout the trial. A police investigation after Mrs Venables was reported missing on 4 May 1982 had failed to find any trace of her. Her decayed remains were not discovered until July 2019, five years after Venables had moved out of Quaking House Farm where they had lived together. The new owners wanted the tank serviced and an engineer discovered remnants of her clothing, a clump of hair and a human skull. After tests determined the remains were those of Mrs Venables, her husband was charged with her murder. David Venables killed his wife Brenda after rekindling an affair with another woman Mrs Venables' disappearance was reported in the Worcester News During his trial, details of his double life were revealed as prosecutors told how he had been in a long-term on-off relationship with his mother's carer Lorraine Styles since around 1967. Despite her death in 2017, a statement Mrs Styles had given to police in 1984 was read to the court which described him as being ""quite composed"" about his wife going missing. Jurors heard the evidence showed he had used a manhole cover to weigh down his wife's body. The judge also rejected defence claims that the killing had been carried out in the heat of the moment, telling Venables the whole process of disposing of the body in the septic tank, and then leaving no trace, must have required considerable planning. The remains were found during a clearing of the septic tank ""Your complete lack of respect for Brenda is obvious from your decision to dispose of her body in the septic tank,"" Mrs Justice Tipples told him. ""The fact that is what you did with her body is disgusting and repulsive."" Addressing the motive for the killing, she said: ""I am sure you killed Brenda Venables to remove her from your life and the complications she may have presented to you in any divorce proceedings. ""There is no doubt an element of greed and selfishness."" Venables was convicted of murder and sentenced for spend at least 18 years in prison It took the jury 16 hours and 43 minutes over four days to convict Venables, of Elgar Drive, Kempsey, of Brenda's murder. After the retired farmer's conviction, her family spoke of how they wished she had been able to leave her marriage. ""We feel utter horror and despair that Brenda was murdered,"" they said. ""She was no harm to anyone, being a gentle and increasingly quiet woman. At the time of her disappearance, her devastated elderly parents never gave up hope that she would return, they said. Brenda Venables' remains were found in 2019 In a statement after the sentencing, her family said: ""We recall her father Harold watching the garden path in hope of Brenda coming to see them. ""He died heartbroken two and a half years later."" The thought Brenda lay undiscovered for more than 37 years while the septic tank continued to be used ""is simply unthinkable,"" they added. Reading out the tribute on the family's behalf, Det Con Claire Masters of West Mercia Police, said: ""We will never be able to forgive David Venables for what he did and for not telling us the truth.""

"Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year highThe prices of fuel and food climbed in June, latest figures show.","Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, while costs for milk, cheese and eggs also climbed, the ONS said. Unions have been calling for pay rises to help workers cope as the rising cost of living eats into household budgets. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by the European Union to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices stood at 184p per litre in June, the ONS said, the highest since records began in 1990 and up from 129.7p a year earlier. The monthly rise was also the largest on record. The average price of diesel in June was 192.4p per litre, again a record high, the ONS said. It led to the said average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel were leading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Elsewhere, food prices have been climbing, with costs increasing at the fastest rate since March 2009. Milk, cheese and eggs saw the biggest rises in June, latest figures show, with the prices of vegetables, meat and ready meals also up. Your device may not support this visualisation Research firm Kantar has predicted supermarket bills are set to rise by an average of Â£454 this year. This comes as energy bills, which rose by an unprecedented Â£700 a year in April for a typical household, are forecast to climb again in October. Prices charged in restaurants and for accommodation have also increased, climbing by 8.6% in the year to June, the ONS said. Christine and Mel Simpson fear how bad inflation will get this winter Christine and Mel Simpson from Derby receive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" Mel told the BBC. Meanwhile, Rachel, who uses the Community Pantry on Hurst Farm in Derbyshire where you pay Â£5 for membership and can do a shop worth about Â£50, said the service had made a massive difference for her family, especially after she lost her job as a childminder during the pandemic. ""We live hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings. We've tried to cut down on like the heating and the water bills, we're very careful what we use each day."" Other countries around the world are also experiencing a cost of living squeeze, with many affected by the same global factors as the UK. However, the UK's inflation rate is currently higher than then US and others in Europe, with the latest estimates of annual inflation for Germany at 8.2% and for France at 6.5%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the two main causes of inflation globally were surging energy prices and worker shortages. But he said: ""The euro-zone has the first factor but not really the second. The US has the second factor, but not really the first. The UK has both. That's why inflation is highest in the UK."" EU governments had also ""done more to prevent"" higher wholesale gas and electricity prices being passed onto households, he added. And while the UK's labour market was ""just as tight as in the US"", it appeared UK workers were ""more able to bargain for higher wages"", which could fuel further inflation. Mr Dales said the ""combined influence"" of Brexit and the pandemic had resulted in shortages of workers, due to fewer workers coming to the UK from overseas and a greater share of people of working age ""have either become unable to work or decided they no longer want to or need to work"". As Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in his Mansion House speech on Tuesday night, the inflationary pressures on the economy are no longer just global, they are domestic too. The labour force has shrunk, making it harder to recruit and pushing up wages. ""This increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressure, "" he said. The headline inflation rate in the UK is already the highest of the advanced G7 economies. And much criticism has come the Bank of England's way in the Conservative leadership campaign. But labour shortages are far more directly under government policy control and yet they are barely being discussed in the leadership debate. The higher rates of inflation will make the conversation with public sector workers yet more tense. And all roads appear to lead to a rise in base interest rates next month of half a percentage point - the biggest rise in nearly three decades. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the Bank of England to ""bear down on inflation"". ""Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK,"" he said. But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said rising inflation could push family finances ""to the brink"" after a decade of slow wage growth. ""It's the result of a decade of Tory mismanagement of our economy meaning living standards and real wages have failed to grow,"" she said. On Tuesday, the government announced that the police and most NHS staff would get below-inflation pay rises. It has consistently said that big wage increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up causing a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", but Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the announcements were ""a kick in the teeth"". Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said rising prices were ""wiping out pay increases"", adding there ""cost of living crisis is only worsening"". The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said rates could rise by as much as 0.5 percentage points at its next rates meeting in August in a bid to stem rising prices. That would take them to 1.75%.

The surprising joviality of Tory votes,"The announcement of Tory MPs' voting results are televised - but not the votes themselves Tory MPs have been voting for party leadership - and prime ministerial - candidates, amid accusations of badmouthing and negative briefing. But what's the atmosphere really been like? This hugely important act of democracy can seem quite secretive, especially in an age of social media. No recordings or photos can be taken inside Parliament, apart from special areas where we're allowed to broadcast, and when the results of each round of voting are read out. Therefore, it's up to journalists to describe what they see and hear. The room where the vote happens is a short distance from Central Lobby - the grand space between the House of Lords and the House of Commons that you often see on TV. In fact, if you walk from there up the stairs to Committee Room 14, you pass several busts of former prime ministers: a reminder that by casting their ballots Conservative MPs are playing their part in history. For the hacks who are allowed to watch it all unfold, the closest we can get is the often hot, stuffy, corridor outside the room. Race to take on Sunak for next PM tightens Who could be the next prime minister? At the door to the room stands one of the Commons doorkeepers, wearing a long coat with tails and a white bow tie. She stops each MP and tells them to have their ""pass and phone ready"". MPs have to leave their phones at the door so they can't share pictures of their polling cards on social media. Remember, it's supposed to be a secret ballot. One former cabinet minister told me he objected to having to show his parliamentary pass, because it was his ""constitutional right"" to vote. Some might see the irony of this position, given that the government is asking us to show ID in order to vote in future elections. Theresa May, still a Tory MP, has been keen not to create any headlines As MPs turn up to cast their ballots, reporters try to grab a word with them. Some walk past quickly, avoiding eye contact, desperate not to create any headlines. Theresa May has done this a few times in recent days. I wonder why? But others stop for a quick chat. Sometimes, if they want to say something a bit outrageous, they ask if it can be ""off the record"". If that's the case, we attribute their quotes to a ""campaign source"", ""ally"" or ""backer"". While the contest has, at times, been acrimonious, the mood at Parliament's polling station is usually quite jovial. MPs often share a joke with members of the 1922 Committee (made up of backbenchers), overseeing the contest, who sit at a desk ticking names off a list. The Conservative Party might seem from the outside to be tearing itself limb from limb, but that is not the impression you get here, aside from the odd hostile briefing. It's sometimes easy to forget the gravity of what is unfolding. A few hundred men and women helping to select the most powerful person in the country. Their decisions will affect all of us.

"Sunak and Truss into Tory leadership final roundLiz Truss has made a late surge to qualify for the final run-off, as Penny Mordaunt is eliminated.","Rishi Sunak will face Liz Truss in the race to be the next prime minister, after Penny Mordaunt was eliminated in the latest Tory leadership ballot. Ms Truss overturned Ms Mordaunt's narrow lead in the final vote among Tory MPs, securing a place in the run-off by 113 votes to 105. She will now go head-to-head with Mr Sunak, who topped the final ballot with 137 votes. The winner will be decided by a vote among Conservative party members. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss secured her place after a late surge in support, picking up 27 votes in the 24 hours since the last round whilst Ms Mordaunt only gained 13. The two had been scrambling to secure the backing of MPs who had backed Kemi Badenoch, who was knocked out in Tuesday's vote. Policy guide: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss Amol Rajan: Why newspapers matter more in race to be next PM Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a Truss supporter, said her campaign had ""come with momentum at the end"". He added that her stance on post-Brexit regulatory reforms and plans to help those on low incomes had convinced colleagues to back her. The campaign for Mr Sunak, the former chancellor, said his 137 votes were a ""really strong result with a clear mandate from MPs"". Speaking to broadcasters, he said he was ""humbled"" to be in the final two, and said he was best-placed to ""beat Keir Starmer at the next election"". Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt ran a campaign emphasising her support for Brexit and her ability to win Labour-held seats for the Tories. Although she briefly served in Theresa May's cabinet, she has only held more junior positions under Mr Johnson and has boosted her profile considerably having started as one of the lesser-known candidates. Tory MP George Freeman, one of her supporters, said she had come ""from nowhere to fight a great campaign"". ""We have lit a flame she is not going away,"" he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: I want to be honest about challenges we face Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the cabinet mutiny against Boris Johnson, has repeatedly clashed with Ms Truss over economic policy during the leadership campaign. Ms Truss has promised to introduce Â£38bn of tax cuts if she wins power, including scrapping April's rise in National Insurance, introduced by the government whilst Mr Sunak was still at the Treasury. She has also pledged to cancel planned corporation tax rises from April 2023, which Mr Sunakannounced in March last year. But Mr Sunak has rubbished her proposals, saying the tax rises are needed to repair the public finances after Covid and accusing her of peddling ""something-for-nothing economics"". He has said he wants to lower the tax burden, but this should only be done when inflation, currently running at its highest level for 40 years, has been brought under control. Before Ms Mordaunt was knocked out, Sir Keir Starmer criticised the remaining contenders for making ""unfunded"" tax pledges worth billions of pounds. Speaking atBoris Johnson's final Prime Minister's Questions,the Labour leader also said the leadership rivals had not had a ""single decent thing to say"" about the current government's record. ""I think the message coming out of this leadership contest is pretty clear - they got us into this mess, and they've no idea how to get us out of it,"" he added. This video can not be played I've run a positive campaign, says Liz Truss Although Mr Sunak has come first in all the voting rounds among Tory MPs, surveys have suggested he may struggle to maintain his advantage among members. A YouGov survey of 725 party members on Monday and Tuesday suggested Mr Sunak would lose to either Ms Mordaunt or Ms Truss in a head-to-head. The poll had Ms Mordaunt beating Mr Sunak by 51% to 37% and Ms Truss beating him by 54% to 35%. A dozen regional hustings for members will take place between 28 July and 31 August, beginning in Leeds. Before that, Ms Truss and Mr Sunak will also go head-to-head during alive debate on BBC One next Monday. The pair declined to take part in a live debate on Sky News earlier this week,leading to its cancellation, but have now agreed to take part in a debate hosted by the broadcaster on 4 August. The roughly 160,000 Conservative members will then vote by post or online between early August and 2 September, with a winner announced on 5 September. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut?

LiveLiveInflation jumps to 9.4% as petrol pushes prices up5 minutes ago,"UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - jumps to 9.4% in the year to June Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, driven by petrol, energy and food costs Poorer household are being hit harder by rising costs, the Resolution Foundation think tank warns However, the government is confident we will see a ""marked improvement"" in 2023, a treasury minister says Labour pushes for urgent action from the government, calling for it to take VAT off energy bills We are answering some of your questions on the rising rate inflation rate and the cost of living And, as part of our Counting the Cost of Living series, BBC News will be asking people from towns and cities around the UK how they are coping - and revisiting them over the coming months We're starting today in the Midlands with Derby, hearing from households, businesses and families Edited by Nathan Williams That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage. Today's page was edited by Nathan Williams and Owen Amos and written by Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Katie Thompson and Thomas Mackintosh. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, so here's a reminder of the main developments today: Disruption caused by strike action on the railways is set to continue The UK is experiencing a ""summer of discontent"", with strike action happening amid the cost-of-living crisis. The latest jump in the inflation rate is just the start of a ""financial
catastrophe"", according to consumer champion Martin Lewis. Household fuel bills are set to ""rocket"" following a change to
the energy price cap in the autumn, he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One
programme. The Money Saving Expert founder calls the timing of the Conservative
leadership contest ""devastating"". He says millions of people will be
hit by energy bill hikes not long after a new prime minister is in office. Lewis claims fuel discounts announced by the government in May are ""no
longer fit for purpose"" because they were based on an underestimate of how
much prices would rise. He calls for a
change in the way the energy price cap is regulated â or for the tax system to
take on the financial burden. Christine and Mel are worried prices will rise more InDerby, pensioners Christine and Mel Simpsonreceive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" says Mel. Beverley says many people are struggling in Derbyshire Beverley Parkeris chief executive of the charity Rural Action Derbyshire, which aims to tackle disadvantage in rural communities. She says as the cost of living has gone up, people are having to make difficult choices about what they spend their money on. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges, which doesn't really help from an energy saving point of view because the biggest part of your bill is the standing charge, but they think it will. ""It's a massive risk and we've heard of people getting food poisoning from eating food that's not been stored correctly."" Public transport in rural areas can also be expensive. ""We've heard of people walking six miles to the food bank and six miles home,"" she says, because they can't afford the bus. Throughout today we've been bringing you reaction to the latest interest rate hike from Derby. The city is unique to its residents but itâs also quite average in various ways, making it a fairly typical example of whatâs happening in the UK with the cost of living crisis. We have middle-class families with parents employed by big firms like Rolls-Royce and Toyota but also record numbers using foodbanks. In comparison to other places, salaries compare favourably to house prices, but many are struggling. Located in the Midlands, being on the Midland Mainline and CrossCountry line and just off the M1, Derby is well connected. It doesnât have the wealth or expense of bigger cities but nor does it have the unemployment issues seen elsewhere. Lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their money on essentials like heating As the cost-of-living crisis bites, the Resolution
Foundation claims the UKâs very top earners have seen their pay rise above
inflation â while those at the bottom have seen theirs cut in real terms by 6%. The result is a growth in the âwealth gapâ, says Jack
Leslie, a senior economist at the think tank, which ""focuses on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes"". âThe better-off are doing particularly well at the moment,â
Leslie tells BBC Radio 4âs World at One programme. Lower-income groups
spend a higher proportion of their income on essentials like food and heating â
so inflation hits them hardest, Leslie says. Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent Food price increases are relentless for people in therural
Perthshire village of Pitlochry. But this community is helping each other out with free food
supplies in an open shed. Allan Chilton, 30, arrived to grab some eggs off the shelves
before heading to the supermarket for his weekly supplies. It saves him a few
pounds. Every penny counts with household pressures mounting. The quirky idea, known as the ""community larder"", is open 24
hours a day allowing people to come anytime. Itâs a two way process too with folk dropping off any excess
food they arenât planning on using. Clodagh RiceNorthern Ireland business correspondent Businesses are also facing huge cost increases - forcing many to hike their own prices for customers. Wilson's Country, a leadingpotato processor based in Portadown, Northern Ireland, is being hit by soaring energy costs. Managing director Lewis Cunningham says: ""Our electricity
now compared to 2021 has doubled, and at one stage in the Ukraine war in
February and March it tripled. ""And it's a very difficult cost to reduce as we
need to have the machines on, we need to wash potatoes, pack potatoes and chill
potatoes - and even more concerning is what the autumn might bring.â âUnfortunately the costs have been elevated now at such a
high level with no outlook on the horizon of any costs reducing that we are
having to pass these costs on [to customers],"" he adds. Jacqui Trowsdale says the school is being stretched due to a rise in demand for school meals Deputy headteacher ofAllenton Community Primary School in Derby, Jacqui Trowsdale,says demand for school meals is up by 30% - with a massive increase in breakfast club in particular. It's gone from having 60 children to more than 90. That's because they try to keep prices as low as possible for families. ""It serves children from very large families so it could be that it is cheaper to feed them here than at home,"" she says. ""We can offer a variation of foods too. It certainly supports our parents who need to go out to work."" Gemma Bull is struggling to save a house deposit due to the cost of living Gemma Bull, a teaching assistant at the school, says she is having to prioritise where they buy food from and shop around at different supermarkets because of price hikes. She has four children at the school and has seen her weekly food bill more than double. ""Children are resilient, especially at our school, parents as well,"" she says. ""Being able to offer breakfast club and after school clubs helps the parents. After school clubs are free and that helps parents in our community."" Noor NanjiBBC News Karen Betts, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, believes everybody is going to see the price of
their weekly shop rise. But speaking to the
BBC, she says food manufacturers are ""doing everything they can""
to try to contain price rises. ""Our
industry knows that we have a responsibility to keep food affordable and to
bear down on prices,"" she says. ""But
equally, all food manufacturers are seeing enormous rises in the costs of their
inputs, whether that's ingredients, energy, labour, raw material, and
logistics, they are all really going up in price."" Ms
Betts knows food and drink companies are ""cutting costs
internally"" to limit passing on price rises to consumers. ""But obviously that there are limits to
that,"" she explains. ""All businesses need to remain viable. And so I
think we will see price inflation continue for some months."" Q: Chris Barnes in Somerset asks why disabled people are being treated as ""third-class citizens"". He refers to the fact that hiscost of living payment,externalis lower than for those on other types of benefit. A: In September, people like Chris on disability benefits such as DLA or PIP will receive a Â£150 cost of living payment. That is designed to reflect the higher energy costs many people with disabilities face. The Â£150 payment is not dependent on income. Those who also receive other so-called means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit,will receive the Â£650 payment on top. (Note that the Â£650 is paid in two instalments.) The adequacy of these payments is hotly-debated - not least because domestic energy bills from October are now forecast to be even higher than previously thought. One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more. Analysts say the Bank of England is under pressure to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting in August. But it's a tough balancing act, as the Bank does not want to slow the economy too much. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. They currently stand at 1.25%. Read more about interest rates here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Q: BarrieTuckerasks: Why has the Bank of England ""sat on its hands"", waiting to hike interest rates in August? A:Interest rates are set by the Bank of Englandâs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) â a collection of nine economists. They meet eight times a year. Emergency rate rises are very rare, so the calendar is set, and their next decision will be made on 4 August. Some commentators agree - to a degree - with Barrie, arguing that the Bank rate should have been pushed higher, earlier. Last night, the Bankâs governor, Andrew Bailey, said the MPC was committed to doing what it can to get inflation back to its 2% target.That could include raising the Bank rate from 1.25% to 1.75% in August. The Bank rate affects consumers in what they pay on loans, including mortgages, and what they receive in savings rates. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent We've been taking a number of your questions on the latest inflation rate rise. Q: John Blanning asks: Why some prices are going up, when they have nothing to do with
increases in the cost of grain? A:Prices
are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as a result of a range of, often
complex, factors. The
rising cost of fuel is one of those elements, as is the soaring price of
energy, in part owing to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine. Remember
that, while households in England, Wales and Scotland have an energy price cap,
businesses do not. Raw
material costs are also going up, often because of high demand as activity
increased after Covid. Businesses in some sectors are also having to pay higher
wages to attract staff. All
this feeds through to higher prices paid by consumers. You

bit ofJennifer Snaith's business. She owns Bijoux Beauty inSunderlandand the
increases can be measured by one important item â rubber gloves. They used to be Â£7.99. Now, theyâre Â£17.99. ""It's not just
the money, shopping around for the best price for PPE or beauty products takes
time,"" she explains. ""Suppliers have increased delivery costs too. They used to
be included but now theyâre around Â£15 extra for next day delivery."" Her gas bills have also gone up by around 25% and in a busy
salon that uses gallons of hot water, sheâs had to change the way they work to
keep their expenses down. They closed for one day a week following the pandemic and now
itâs two, with the same amount of customers coming in. Combined with an
increase in their prices, businesswomen like Jennifer are having to think of
smart ways to cope with the cost of living. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The soaring cost of living means families are looking closely at their budgets, the resilience of their finances, and whether they have savings tucked away. Lloyds Banking Group boss Charlie Nunnrecently told BBC News that most customers have less than Â£500 of savings in their account. The dilemma now is that savings are needed to deal with unexpected costs and bills as prices rise, but inflation is eating away at the value of those savings. Financial information service Moneyfacts says interest rates offered by savings providers are improving, but â for an easy access savings account â the best rate is 1.6%. This is well below the inflation rate of 9.4%. Rachel says her family is facing increasing energy and childcare costs With many families struggling with soaring prices,a community food
project in Derbyshireis helping people save money on their weekly shop.
For a membership fee of Â£5 people can get around Â£50 worth of food. Rachel, who has two children, lost her job as a childminderduring the pandemic and although she is now working part-time she says the family is still finding things tough. ""We live
hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings,"" she says. ""So we're just living with
whatever comes in, it
goes out on bills and on food and on looking after the children."" Rachel says the community pantry is a massive help and is also encouraging her children to eat more fruit and vegetables. Sue has been using the food pantry for three weeks Sue Stephens also uses the pantry and says it has cut her food bill by Â£30-Â£40. At first she says she was embarrassed to ask for help. ""I felt like I was sort of gonna be scrounging I think if I came you know, because I work and I thought I shouldn't really be coming,"" she says. ""But no, they said that's fine... because everybody's feeling the pinch."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Julie, a parent carer for her disabled teenage daughter, receives Universal Credit and Carer's Allowance. She asks why the Â£650 cost of living payment is not given to those in receipt of Carer's Allowance. Julie is not the only carer to have raised this point. Somebody receiving Carerâs Allowance is not automatically
eligible for the Â£650 cost of living payment, which comes in two instalments.
Charities say several hundred thousand carers will miss out. However, the government points out that 60% of working age
people who get Carerâs Allowance will qualify for the payment because they are
in a household which receives other types of mean-tested benefits, such as
Universal Credit. Iâve written an article on eligibility for cost of living payments here. It is also worth
stressing that some ""hidden"" carers who are entitled to Carer's
Allowance do not claim it, so if you care for someone for at least 35 hours a
week, it is worth checking. The issue of inflation was raised in the Commons earlier - during the final Prime Minister's Questions for Boris Johnson. Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked the PM's track record on the economy - quoting Tory leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt as saying what's been going on ""isn't working"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford later described the 9.4% inflation rate as one of Johnson's ""record-breaking efforts in office"". Johnson repeatedly defended his performance, highlighting the post-Covid recovery and low unemployment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Women's health: Plan to stop 'sexist' NHS care,"Doctors in England will be given mandatory training to better treat female medical conditions under wider plans to improve women's health. Free access to NHS fertility treatment will be expanded and there will be more funding for mobile breast cancer screening. The government said the changes, part of its women's health strategy, were based on responses from 100,000 people. But critics said more must be done to close the ""gender gap"" in NHS services. The government opened acall for evidence in Spring 2021,externalto collect views on women's health from members of the public, academics, charities and campaigners. Women in England live on average four years longer than men but spend more of their life in poor health, which can limit their ability to work and participate in day-to-day activities. Sexism has previously been blamed for a disproportionate rise in gynaecology waiting lists andfailings around the prescribing of hormone replacement therapy(HRT). Sleepless nights for women due to HRT shortage HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK women ""We heard from women that the system doesn't listen to them when they come forward and ask for help with their healthcare needs,"" Minister for Women's Health Maria Caulfield told BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour. ""These are women often juggling jobs, young families and caring responsibilities, and unless we make it work from them they will continue to face barriers seeking help."" The government said that individuals responding to the consultation felt there was a lack of understanding among some medical professionals about health conditions which only affect women. From the 2024/25 academic year, mandatory teaching and assessment specifically relating to women's health will be introduced for all medical students and new doctors. The government said it also plans to: Provide Â£10 million funding for breast cancer screening to pay for 25 mobile units in areas with low testing rates Update guidance around the treatment of severe endometriosis, a debilitating condition which affects one in 10 women where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes Introduce a pregnancy loss certificate in England, providing legal recognition when a baby dies within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy Encourage the expansion of dedicated women's health hubs so maternity, gynaecology and sexual health services can be accessed in a single place Miriam Levin, health and care programme director at the charity Engage Britain, welcomed ""any steps"" to tackle health inequalities, but said the government had to ensure that women's concerns would be properly listened to. This video can not be played 'You've either got a vagina or a voice' -  Sharon shares her experiences with other women at her local salon ""We hear stories of women suffering with a vast range of problems, from endometriosis to menopause, and often feeling as though they're dismissed or not taken seriously by some health professionals,"" she said. ""The only way this strategy can succeed is for the government to take a fresh approach - by hearing what female patients have to say, then putting their experiences at the very heart of delivering it."" Under the plans, there will also be changes to the rules around fertility treatment in England: In the future, couples considering IVF should be able to see how NHS provision in their local area compares with other parts of the country. It will be possible to access NHS fertility treatment if one half of a couple has already had a child from a previous relationship, something that has proved difficult in much of England. Female same-sex couples will no longer have to pay for artificial insemination at a private clinic to prove they are having difficulty conceiving before being able to access IVF services on the NHS. Sarah Norcross, director of the fertility charity PET, welcomed the decision to remove some barriers to IVF access but said it was ""incredibly disappointing"" that there was no plan to tackle the ""postcode lottery"" of treatment in different parts of England. ""The commitment to improve transparency in relation to the availability of IVF does not equate to giving women the chance to try to have a baby,"" she said. Health Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""Our health and care system only works if it works for everyone. It is not right that 51% of our population are disadvantaged in accessing the care they need, simply because of their sex.""

Sri Lanka elects new president opposed by many,"Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected by parliament Sri Lankan MPs have elected prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the country's new president, despite his unpopularity with the public. Mr Wickremesinghe faces the task of leading the country out of its economic collapse and restoring order after months of mass protests. He roundly defeated his main rival for the job, Dullus Alahapperuma, with 134 votes to 82 in a parliamentary vote. Sri Lanka's ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week. He bolted to the Maldives and then Singapore after thousands of protesters stormed his presidential residences and other government buildings, calling for his resignation. They had also called for the resignation of Mr Wickremesinghe, a close ally of the Rajapaksa political family who was appointed prime minister in May. Protesters last week burnt down his private home and also stormed his prime ministerial office in Colombo in demonstrations against his leadership. On Wednesday, many expressed despair and disappointment over his win. ""I am absolutely disgusted at the resultâ¦ I cannot believe that 134 people - MPs that are supposed to represent the people-  have completely disregarded the wants of the people,"" one activist Jeana De Zoysa told the BBC. Protesters and people on new president Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? The hard choices Sri Lankans must make now Mr Wickremesinghe is viewed by many as a shrewd political operator who's managed to cling on in parliament despite his party being wiped out in the 2020 election. It failed to win a single constituency, and its only seat - for which Mr Wickremesinghe nominated himself - was awarded under the party list system reflecting overall votes polled. A former six-time prime minister, he failed in his previous two runs for the presidency. His victory on Wednesday means he will serve out the rest of the presidential term until November 2024. But on Wednesday, after sweeping the vote with the backing of the Rajapaksa's ruling party, he called for unity and bipartisanship moving forward. He told parliament the nation was ""in a very difficult situation"" and there were ""big challenges ahead"". Sri Lanka has been wracked with protests for months because the country is effectively bankrupt and facing acute shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Wickremesinghe is aiming to restore political stability so the country can resume negotiations with the International Monetary fund for a bailout package. He was involved in these talks last month, and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramnua (SLPP) party said most of their members had backed him because of his economic credentials. ""We feel that Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only person with the experience, the know-how and the capacity to provide solutions to the economic crisis,"" General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam told the Reuters news agency. However, it remains unclear whether he will be accepted by protesters - many of whom say he's part of the political elite behind the country's economic mismanagement. On Wednesday, ahead of the results, barricades were set up around the parliament and soldiers lined the perimeter anticipating crowds. Barricades were set up in front of parliament ahead of Wednesday's vote But protesters remained fairly subdued. After the result, some gathered at the Galle Face Green protest site chanted ""Ranil Go Home"". There are fears among some that Mr Wickremesinghe will now crack down on the movement, which has brought hundreds of thousands of ordinary people onto the streets demanding change. When he assumed the job of acting president last week, he ordered the military to do whatever was necessary to restore public order, following protesters storming and occupying government buildings. He also extended a national state of emergency order this week to stamp out any flare-ups. However, his immediate challenges include sourcing fuel supplies and managing the public discontent - which will mean working on removing the bitterness, anger and disappointment within society. His main challenger in Wednesday's vote was Mr Alahapperuma, a dissident MP in the ruling party who gained the backing of the main opposition. He had pledged to bring a cross-party government to Sri Lanka that would ""put an end to the deceitful political culture"" but failed to muster enough support. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-offCountries urged to cut use by 15% until March, with the target becoming mandatory if Russia halts supplies.BusinessComments","The European Commission has urged countries across the bloc to cut their gas use by 15% from August to March amid fears Russia could halt supplies. It says the target is voluntary but will become legally binding if Moscow turns off the taps this summer. The key Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany has been offline for maintenance for 10 days and is due to be turned back on this Thursday. But there are concerns Moscow will not follow through on its promise. Adding to the uncertainty, Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that it was not clear whether or in what condition a turbine from the pipeline would be returned in after repairs in Canada. The Russian president said there was a risk the equipment would have to be switched off at ""some point"" and Nord Stream 1 would be shut down. Russia supplied Europe with 40% of its natural gas last year, with Germany the continent's largest importer in 2020, followed by Italy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a Europe-wide cut-off was now a ""likely scenario"". ""Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,"" she said. ""Therefore, in any event, whether it's a partial, major cut-off of Russian gas or a total cut-off of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready."" EU energy rationing can't be ruled out, Shell says Germany takes step closer to gas rationing Since Russia invaded Ukraine it has cut supplies to a number of countries which have rejected its demand for payment for gas in roubles, including Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. It has also been accused of reducing supplies to make it more difficult for EU countries to build up reserves ahead of winter. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in global markets. The Commission said a full cut-off during winter could have a major impact on EU economies, reducing growth by up to 1.5%. The International Monetary Fund last week warned it could plunge countries into recession, heightening an energy crisis that has sent consumer bills soaring. European nations have been trying to build up gas storage ahead of winter in case Moscow further restricts supplies. The proposed 15% reduction is compared with average consumption in the same period from 2016 to 2021. The gas that is saved would be put into storage, Ms von der Leyentweeted,external. ""This is a big ask for the whole of the EU - but it is necessary to protect us,"" she said. She said that some member states are ""more vulnerable"" to gas supply disruption, and that EU states ""all need to be ready to share gas"". The plan has hit resistance from Poland, which has filled its gas storage to 98% of capacity and does not feel the need to cut its use. Other countries have less stored - Hungary, for example, is at 47% of capacity. The European Commission suggested measures governments could take to cut gas use, including compensating industries that use less and limiting heating and cooling temperatures in public buildings. Governments should also decide the order in which they would force industries to shut down in the event of a supply emergency. Households are classed as ""protected consumers"" under EU rules and would be shielded from such curbs. EU member states will vote on the Council's rationing plan at a meeting of energy ministers on 26 July. Germany has already been taking steps towards gas rationing. In June the country triggered the ""alarm"" stage ofan emergency gas plan to deal with shortages. On Monday the International Energy Agency (IEA) called on European countries to further reduce gas consumption, saying Russia's latest moves to restrict gas flows, along with other supply disruptions, are a ""red alert"" to the EU. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said that despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas, it hasn't been enough to prevent Europe ""finding itself in an incredibly precarious position today"", adding that the next few months were ""critical"".

Government approves Sizewell C nuclear power plant,"The planned Sizewell C plant is expected to cost about Â£20bn The government has given the go-ahead for the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. The project, mainly funded by the French energy company EDF, is expected to cost in the region of Â£20bn. The company said the new plant would generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. Campaigners Stop Sizewell C said they ""will be looking closely at appealing this decision"". The new plant would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF said the new two-reactor plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Negotiations with the government on raising funds for the project are continuing and a decision on the finances is expected in 2023. Sizewell C would be built just south of RSPB Minsmere Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed the development consent and central government will make all future planning decisions on the plant as it is deemed to be a nationally significant infrastructure project. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in May 2020. The secretary of state overrode recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate not to grant the go-ahead for the scheme unless issues on water supplies and nature were resolved. In its report, the examining authority said it recommended,externalthat ""unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out"". The inspectorate's chief executive, Sarah Richards, said: ""This examination took place during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, and the examining authority worked hard to ensure that local people, the local authorities - East Suffolk District Council and Suffolk County Council - and other interested parties were able to fully participate.""

""Regardless of where you stand on the project, I think everybody is pleased that we have arrived at a decision now,"" he said.

How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Campaigners knock government over Sizewell figures Government to take 20% stake in new nuclear plant The government has committed Â£100m to developing the project and planned to take a 20% stake in the plant. Local anti-nuclear campaigners have objected to the plant on several grounds, including that it would be built next to the RSPB's Minsmere nature reserve and have a negative effect on wildlife. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C said Sizewell would be turned into the ""biggest building site in Europe"" and it would drive tourists away The campaign group Stop Sizewell C said it would continue to oppose the project and would be trying to find grounds to appeal against the decision. Alison Downes, from the group, said: ""We are going to continue challenging this project because of technical concerns, impacts on the environment, the investors, the fact that households are going to have to pay, the huge expense and potential for massive delays."" She claimed people in the local area were ""devastated"" by the latest decision. ""They're absolutely resolute and steadfast with us and our campaign to keep fighting against this damaging project,"" she said. ""This is going to be turned into the biggest building site in Europe and that will drive tourists and a lot of people who could make this a prosperous region away.""

The Conservative-run council said it would review the development consent over the coming weeks. Craig Rivett, deputy leader and cabinet member for economic development said they would work with the project stakeholders and the local community ""to ensure that appropriate mitigation is in place to help lessen the impacts of the project during the construction phase"". Suffolk County Council said it was ""disappointed that a number of key issues have not been fully resolved"" including ""the blight"" of additional pylons no reference to removing a Sizewell link road once construction was completed. The council added that Suffolk would benefit from nearly Â£200m of investment to mitigate the impact on communities, the environment and infrastructure and that a ""far greater quantity of construction materials will be delivered by rail and sea, reducing the number of lorries on the county's rural roads"". However the GMB, which represents workers in the energy sector, said Sizewell C's approval was ""a vital step forward for energy and net-zero"". Anti-nuclear campaigners protesting on the beach in the shadow of the decommissioned Sizewell A, which generated electricity between 1966 and 2006 By Esme Stallard, BBC Science and Climate Change reporter The UK government plans to completely decarbonise the country's electricity by 2035. This means that all our electricity will be produced from renewable or low-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear. Up to 24GW of nuclear-generated electricity is planned by 2050,external- this is three times more than we have now and could provide up to 25% of our required electricity demand. The other 75% would therefore have to come from other forms of renewable or low-carbon. All but one of the UK's existing nuclear power plants are due to stop generating by 2030, and begin the lengthy decommissioning process. The government is aware of the need to accelerate plans to meet its decarbonising targets. And, therefore, of making a decision on Sizewell C. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also said that expanding the use of nuclear would help resist ""bullying"" from Russia, which dominates the European gas market, and build energy independence by providing a stable energy supply. The energy produced from other low-carbon sources like solar and wind vary with the weather, until there is further development of energy storage technology. Although nuclear is one of the greenest forms of energy -  as measured by amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced per unit of energy - there are still some emissions associated with manufacturing the steel and other materials needed. And the long-term environmental consequences of dealing with and storing nuclear waste remain unclear. The Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) said it ""hoped that many of the project benefits, claimed by the developer, would come to fruition"" such as new jobs, low carbon electricity generation and development of habitats to make up for the loss of land. Chairman of the AONB Partnership, Nick Collinson, said: ""This part of England has been designated for its nature, tranquillity and scenic quality, much of which will be lost or damaged during the 9-12 year construction. ""The partnership will of course work constructively with EDF to ensure mitigation and compensation is maximised to minimise the damage to this special part of the world."" Campaign group, Greenpeace, called the project an ""expensive white elephant"" that was ""trashing an important nature reserve"". Its chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: ""Rather than wasting time and money on this red herring energy solution, the government should throw everything at making cheaper, cleaner and more reliable renewables the backbone of our energy system.""

Government approves Sizewell C nuclear power plantThe business secretary grants development consent for a new nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast.SuffolkScotRail warning despite return to full timetableThe train operator warns passengers could still face disruption due to the recent extreme heat.ScotlandComments,"The planned Sizewell C plant is expected to cost about Â£20bn The government has given the go-ahead for the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. The project, mainly funded by the French energy company EDF, is expected to cost in the region of Â£20bn. The company said the new plant would generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. Campaigners Stop Sizewell C said they ""will be looking closely at appealing this decision"". The new plant would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF said the new two-reactor plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Negotiations with the government on raising funds for the project are continuing and a decision on the finances is expected in 2023. Sizewell C would be built just south of RSPB Minsmere Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed the development consent and central government will make all future planning decisions on the plant as it is deemed to be a nationally significant infrastructure project. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in May 2020. The secretary of state overrode recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate not to grant the go-ahead for the scheme unless issues on water supplies and nature were resolved. In its report, the examining authority said it recommended,externalthat ""unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out"". The inspectorate's chief executive, Sarah Richards, said: ""This examination took place during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, and the examining authority worked hard to ensure that local people, the local authorities - East Suffolk District Council and Suffolk County Council - and other interested parties were able to fully participate."" Tom McGarry, head of regional affairs at EDF Energy, said the company would ""proceed with humility"" Tom McGarry, EDF's head of regional affairs, said the company would ""proceed with humility"". ""Regardless of where you stand on the project, I think everybody is pleased that we have arrived at a decision now,"" he said. ""What we have to make sure is that we work with the local communities to minimise construction when it begins and all throughout and also maximise the opportunities for Suffolk."" How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Campaigners knock government over Sizewell figures Government to take 20% stake in new nuclear plant The government has committed Â£100m to developing the project and planned to take a 20% stake in the plant. Local anti-nuclear campaigners have objected to the plant on several grounds, including that it would be built next to the RSPB's Minsmere nature reserve and have a negative effect on wildlife. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C said Sizewell would be turned into the ""biggest building site in Europe"" and it would drive tourists away The campaign group Stop Sizewell C said it would continue to oppose the project and would be trying to find grounds to appeal against the decision. Alison Downes, from the group, said: ""We are going to continue challenging this project because of technical concerns, impacts on the environment, the investors, the fact that households are going to have to pay, the huge expense and potential for massive delays."" She claimed people in the local area were ""devastated"" by the latest decision. ""They're absolutely resolute and steadfast with us and our campaign to keep fighting against this damaging project,"" she said. ""This is going to be turned into the biggest building site in Europe and that will drive tourists and a lot of people who could make this a prosperous region away."" Sizewell C, on the right, would be built next to Sizewell B, centre, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, far left, which operated until 2006 and is being decommissioned East Suffolk Council is the local planning authority, but does not make decisions on Sizewell because of its national importance. The Conservative-run council said it would review the development consent over the coming weeks. Craig Rivett, deputy leader and cabinet member for economic development said they would work with the project stakeholders and the local community ""to ensure that appropriate mitigation is in place to help lessen the impacts of the project during the construction phase"". Suffolk County Council said it was ""disappointed that a number of key issues have not been fully resolved"" including ""the blight"" of additional pylons no reference to removing a Sizewell link road once construction was completed. The council added that Suffolk would benefit from nearly Â£200m of investment to mitigate the impact on communities, the environment and infrastructure and that a ""far greater quantity of construction materials will be delivered by rail and sea, reducing the number of lorries on the county's rural roads"". However the GMB, which represents workers in the energy sector, said Sizewell C's approval was ""a vital step forward for energy and net-zero"". Anti-nuclear campaigners protesting on the beach in the shadow of the decommissioned Sizewell A, which generated electricity between 1966 and 2006 By Esme Stallard, BBC Science and Climate Change reporter The UK government plans to completely decarbonise the country's electricity by 2035. This means that all our electricity will be produced from renewable or low-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear. Up to 24GW of nuclear-generated electricity is planned by 2050,external- this is three times more than we have now and could provide up to 25% of our required electricity demand. The other 75% would therefore have to come from other forms of renewable or low-carbon. All but one of the UK's existing nuclear power plants are due to stop generating by 2030, and begin the lengthy decommissioning process. The government is aware of the need to accelerate plans to meet its decarbonising targets. And, therefore, of making a decision on Sizewell C. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also said that expanding the use of nuclear would help resist ""bullying"" from Russia, which dominates the European gas market, and build energy independence by providing a stable energy supply. The energy produced from other low-carbon sources like solar and wind vary with the weather, until there is further development of energy storage technology. Although nuclear is one of the greenest forms of energy -  as measured by amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced per unit of energy - there are still some emissions associated with manufacturing the steel and other materials needed. And the long-term environmental consequences of dealing with and storing nuclear waste remain unclear. The Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) said it ""hoped that many of the project benefits, claimed by the developer, would come to fruition"" such as new jobs, low carbon electricity generation and development of habitats to make up for the loss of land. Chairman of the AONB Partnership, Nick Collinson, said: ""This part of England has been designated for its nature, tranquillity and scenic quality, much of which will be lost or damaged during the 9-12 year construction. ""The partnership will of course work constructively with EDF to ensure mitigation and compensation is maximised to minimise the damage to this special part of the world."" Campaign group, Greenpeace, called the project an ""expensive white elephant"" that was ""trashing an important nature reserve"". Its chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: ""Rather than wasting time and money on this red herring energy solution, the government should throw everything at making cheaper, cleaner and more reliable renewables the backbone of our energy system.""

Care workers having to go hungry to provide help,"Samantha Howe has been working in care for 12 years, travelling around the sprawling suburbs east of central Leeds delivering vital help to vulnerable adults. Across the country, this highly skilled job often pays the legal minimum. This year, Samantha and her colleagues have been given an 11% boost to their hourly pay rate, up to about Â£11 per hour. But despite this, the cost-of-living crisis is taking its toll, and the 32-year-old has had to ask her parents for help with her food bills. ""It's literally cereal and bed, or toast and bed. If I need to go to bed hungry, I will go to bed hungry. ""I'm living on my own supporting myself to be an independent person. But then to have to, at my age, ask my mum and dad for money, it feels degrading."" Her colleague Melissa Senior is also struggling. ""Realistically, you should be able to afford to buy your own stuff, when you've got a full-time job,"" she said. ""You shouldn't be having to go home then and maybe eat cereal. I do stay because I do actually love the job, but sometimes you do think 'is it worth it'?"" Across England, the directors who run council care services warn they are facing the most challenging time they have ever known. They say the combination of the staffing crisis and rising costs is leaving vulnerable people short of the help that they need as demand rises. Care staff crisis leaves half a million waiting for help in England Social care workers lose out on Â£7,000 in pay each year, charity says Samantha and Melissa work for Leeds-based Springfield Health Care, which provides care in people's own homes and runs care homes across Yorkshire and the north of England. Boss Graeme Lee says they have lost 10% of their staff since April. ""It's costing (staff) sometimes in excess of Â£30-Â£40 a week in order to be able to drive to their clients to deliver the quality service that they want to deliver... but some of them just can't afford to do it."" Three-quarters of Springfield's work is paid for by local authorities, and in Leeds they've received a 10% increase, which they've passed on to staff. But Graeme says in other areas they have been offered as little as 3%. ""In the 28 years that I've been providing care services in Leeds, I'd say this is the most worrying time for the sector,"" he says. A new survey by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) of its members is warning that the rapidly rising cost of basic things is making already challenging conditions in social care much worse. Almost three-quarters of social care directors in England are reporting increasing requests for help. But as demand is increasing, the capacity to meet it is falling. A total of 82% of Adass members said they were worried about the stability of the care market by 2023/24. Already, almost seven in 10 directors say that care providers are closing, ceasing trading or handing back contracts as they struggle with staff numbers. It can mean vulnerable people missing out on having their care needs met and delays for patients being discharged from hospital who need care at home. Sunnyside Nursing Home in Leeds is registered as having 36 beds, but eight are currently unfilled. One wing of the home is empty. Empty room at Sunnyside Nursing Home ""We have referrals come through on our NHS email, at least 10 a week. We could fill every bed twice over,"" says owner Julie Brown. She adds that if they filled the rooms with local authority-funded residents, they would lose money because of the high cost of heating the rooms and the difficulties of recruiting staff. ""To fill the empty beds with people that were publicly funded, we will be Â£150-a-week short of costs. That's eight beds at Â£150, which is not really doable."" Situations like this are causing concern in town halls across England, where councils have responsibility for providing most adult social care. In one day, three people who between them have decades of experience of the workings of different parts of the care system told me they had never been more worried than they are now. When that happens, you heed the warning. We've been talking about the care system that supports older and disabled people being in crisis for a long time. The government has promised to fix it, but their plan for the future does not change the reality of the situation now. Staff shortages and rising costs mean there will be people who don't get the care they need. Maybe it's a woman in her 80s, who needs some help to eat and drink properly. Without it she becomes dehydrated and disorientated, and has a fall. She then gets stuck in hospital because she now needs much more support to return home. Or there is the husband exhausted from caring for his wife of many years, who has dementia. Unable to get respite care, he does more and more until he breaks down, his own physical and mental health ruined. When we see a queue of ambulances outside a hospital, we take that as a sign of the pressures on the NHS, but it is also a sign of a wider health and care system that is not working. If families, the NHS and social care are to cope in the coming months, then that will take a care system that is able to recruit, retain and value the care staff it needs. Adass says without ""immediate and substantial help"" from the government, the current situation will become much worse when coupled with the increasing demand for services which is always seen in the winter months. The government said they were investing Â£5.4 billion to reform adult social care over the next three years. They said they valued the social care workforce, which is why they had provided an extra Â£500 million of funding for training and career development. Cath Roff, the director for adult social care at Leeds City Council, says in her experience, the current situation has never been so desperate. ""The need is now - it is immediate. We are on a burning platform, we are going into winter in one of the most vulnerable situations we have ever been. ""It's almost like a game of chicken, although it's not a game, is it?"" she says.

Busiest day since WW2 for London firefightersFifteen areas across the UK declared major incidents as wildfires broke out after unprecedented heat.,"This video can not be played London wildfires: Family home of 27 years destroyed London's fire service had its busiest day since World War Two dealing with multiple blazes in record-breaking temperatures on Tuesday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. The capital was one of 15 areas around the UK to declare a major incident. The fires started on a day which saw a record temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Wednesday has been cooler for most but thunderstorms are forecast in central England. A yellow warning has been issued by the Met Office for heavy showers and thunderstorms which could bring disruption in eastern and south-east England on Wednesday evening. Despite falling temperatures, the weather iscontinuing to affect transport, with Network Rail advising passengers to only travel if necessary. By mid-afternoon LNER services from London to Scotland were starting up again, while trains on the East Coast Mainline resumed after a fire in Bedfordshire. Around 100 firefighters tackled a fire which destroyed homes in Wennington The fires occurred during record-breaking temperatures in the UK Images show extensive damage to buildings in the village of Wennington on the outskirts of east London Mr Khan said London Fire Brigade (LFB) received 2,600 calls as it dealt with multiple fires. He earlier told Sky News 41 properties were destroyed in London on Tuesday. In Wennington, east London, 100 firefighterstackled a blaze which destroyed several homes. LFB said two rows of terraced houses, four other homes, 12 stables and five cars were destroyed by the blaze, while one firefighter at the scene described it as ""absolute hell"". Dramatic images from the scene showed smoke billowing from buildings, some with their roofs collapsed, and extensive damage to the surrounding land. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Khan said: ""Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War. ""Normally we get 350 calls a day, on a busy day we can get up to 500 calls. Yesterday the fire service had more than 2,600 calls a day."" Are soaring temperatures linked to climate change? Is your area vulnerable to extreme heat? Check the forecast where you are The mayor has advised Londoners not to have barbecues in parks or private gardens over concerns they could set alight grass. LFB assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said he had not seen anything like the ""sheer scale across the whole of London"" as the brigade dealt with 15 major fires, and a large number of wildfires and grassland fires. The heat and dry conditions created ""the perfect scenario"" for fires to spread rapidly across grassland and woodland, with the speed a particular challenge, he said. Speaking in Wennington, he said the brigade had never before asked firefighters to operate when the temperature outside was 40C. ""We're obviously thinking very carefully about how we can be even better prepared as we move forward, because what we do know is that climate change is going to continue to pose challenges for us."" This video can not be played Watch: 'Black, charred, Armageddon' - what UK fire did to our garden Elsewhere, a number of homes weredestroyed by fire in Norfolk, and major incidents were declared inLeicestershire, Hertfordshire,Suffolk,Lincolnshire and Yorkshire., among others. At Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson thanked firefighters and said he had spoken with the chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council. LFB said 16 firefighters had heat-related injuries - two of whom were taken to hospital but have since been discharged. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue saidfour from their crews had been taken to hospitalbut have made a full recovery. Speaking after PMQs, Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse told MPs some of the pressure would now ease as the ""fiercest heat has subsided"" but he warned the summer was likely to bring further hot weather and the risk of wildfire remained elevated. ""That is why we are treating this heatwave as an exacting test of our national resilience and contingency planning,"" he said. Tim Stock alerted the fire brigade when he saw flames near his home in Wennington. Mr Stock, whose house was destroyed, told BBC Radio 5 Live he and his son had spotted the fire in his neighbour's garden but, despite their best efforts with a hose and watering can, had been unable to stop it spreading. ""I reckon about 15 to 20 houses might be gone or uninhabitable,"" he said. ""My house is completely gone, as is the next door neighbour's and three or four other houses along that bit."" Six houses were engulfed in flames in Barnsley The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has accused government spending cuts of hampering the fire service's ability to react. Matt Wrack, the union's general secretary, said firefighters were ""at the forefront of the climate emergency"" but, while the demands of the job were increasing, their resources had been cut by government for over a decade with 11,500 firefighter jobs cut since 2010. Speaking about the LFB, Mr Khan said he inherited closed fire stations, cancelled engines and firefighters losing jobs when he took over as mayor from Boris Johnson. He said he has been rebuilding the capital's fire service with kit and more firefighters. Phil Garrigan, who leads the National Resilience group for the National Fire Chiefs Council, said the UK must now consider what equipment it had to fight wildfires. He said most European countries where significant wildfires occur have planes or helicopters which can collect or distribute water to areas where fire is developing. Meanwhile,Just Stop Oil demonstrators climbed motorway signs on the M25, near Cobham, Surrey, to protest at the extreme temperatures in the UK. Police closed sections of the motorway and at one stage there were five-mile traffic queues approaching junction 30 in Essex, National Highways said. Just Stop Oil protesters climbed gantries over the M25 The latest Met Office provisional figures show that Scotland's record-breaking highest temperature, hit on Tuesday, washigher than first thought, with 35.1C registered at Floors Castle in Kelso. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change, and that hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Met Office chief scientist Prof Stephen Belcher said Tuesday's temperatures were striking due to the large record-breaking margin and the extensive area of the UK experiencing the severe temperatures. But ""aggressive emissions cuts"" could very sharply reduce the frequency of extreme temperatures, he told BBC News. Were you affected by Tuesday's fires?

Inflation jumps to 9.4% as petrol pushes prices up,"UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - jumps to 9.4% in the year to June Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, driven by petrol, energy and food costs Poorer household are being hit harder by rising costs, the Resolution Foundation think tank warns However, the government is confident we will see a ""marked improvement"" in 2023, a treasury minister says Labour pushes for urgent action from the government, calling for it to take VAT off energy bills We are answering some of your questions on the rising rate inflation rate and the cost of living And, as part of our Counting the Cost of Living series, BBC News will be asking people from towns and cities around the UK how they are coping - and revisiting them over the coming months We're starting today in the Midlands with Derby, hearing from households, businesses and families Edited by Nathan Williams That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage. Today's page was edited by Nathan Williams and Owen Amos and written by Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Katie Thompson and Thomas Mackintosh. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, so here's a reminder of the main developments today: Disruption caused by strike action on the railways is set to continue The UK is experiencing a ""summer of discontent"", with strike action happening amid the cost-of-living crisis. The latest jump in the inflation rate is just the start of a ""financial
catastrophe"", according to consumer champion Martin Lewis. Household fuel bills are set to ""rocket"" following a change to
the energy price cap in the autumn, he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One
programme. The Money Saving Expert founder calls the timing of the Conservative
leadership contest ""devastating"". He says millions of people will be
hit by energy bill hikes not long after a new prime minister is in office. Lewis claims fuel discounts announced by the government in May are ""no
longer fit for purpose"" because they were based on an underestimate of how
much prices would rise. He calls for a
change in the way the energy price cap is regulated â or for the tax system to
take on the financial burden. Christine and Mel are worried prices will rise more InDerby, pensioners Christine and Mel Simpsonreceive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" says Mel. Beverley says many people are struggling in Derbyshire Beverley Parkeris chief executive of the charity Rural Action Derbyshire, which aims to tackle disadvantage in rural communities. She says as the cost of living has gone up, people are having to make difficult choices about what they spend their money on. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges, which doesn't really help from an energy saving point of view because the biggest part of your bill is the standing charge, but they think it will. ""It's a massive risk and we've heard of people getting food poisoning from eating food that's not been stored correctly."" Public transport in rural areas can also be expensive. ""We've heard of people walking six miles to the food bank and six miles home,"" she says, because they can't afford the bus. Throughout today we've been bringing you reaction to the latest interest rate hike from Derby. The city is unique to its residents but itâs also quite average in various ways, making it a fairly typical example of whatâs happening in the UK with the cost of living crisis. We have middle-class families with parents employed by big firms like Rolls-Royce and Toyota but also record numbers using foodbanks. In comparison to other places, salaries compare favourably to house prices, but many are struggling. Located in the Midlands, being on the Midland Mainline and CrossCountry line and just off the M1, Derby is well connected. It doesnât have the wealth or expense of bigger cities but nor does it have the unemployment issues seen elsewhere. Lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their money on essentials like heating As the cost-of-living crisis bites, the Resolution
Foundation claims the UKâs very top earners have seen their pay rise above
inflation â while those at the bottom have seen theirs cut in real terms by 6%. The result is a growth in the âwealth gapâ, says Jack
Leslie, a senior economist at the think tank, which ""focuses on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes"". âThe better-off are doing particularly well at the moment,â
Leslie tells BBC Radio 4âs World at One programme. Lower-income groups
spend a higher proportion of their income on essentials like food and heating â
so inflation hits them hardest, Leslie says. Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent Food price increases are relentless for people in therural
Perthshire village of Pitlochry. But this community is helping each other out with free food
supplies in an open shed. Allan Chilton, 30, arrived to grab some eggs off the shelves
before heading to the supermarket for his weekly supplies. It saves him a few
pounds. Every penny counts with household pressures mounting. The quirky idea, known as the ""community larder"", is open 24
hours a day allowing people to come anytime. Itâs a two way process too with folk dropping off any excess
food they arenât planning on using. Clodagh RiceNorthern Ireland business correspondent Businesses are also facing huge cost increases - forcing many to hike their own prices for customers. Wilson's Country, a leadingpotato processor based in Portadown, Northern Ireland, is being hit by soaring energy costs. Managing director Lewis Cunningham says: ""Our electricity
now compared to 2021 has doubled, and at one stage in the Ukraine war in
February and March it tripled. ""And it's a very difficult cost to reduce as we
need to have the machines on, we need to wash potatoes, pack potatoes and chill
potatoes - and even more concerning is what the autumn might bring.â âUnfortunately the costs have been elevated now at such a
high level with no outlook on the horizon of any costs reducing that we are
having to pass these costs on [to customers],"" he adds. Jacqui Trowsdale says the school is being stretched due to a rise in demand for school meals Deputy headteacher ofAllenton Community Primary School in Derby, Jacqui Trowsdale,says demand for school meals is up by 30% - with a massive increase in breakfast club in particular. It's gone from having 60 children to more than 90. That's because they try to keep prices as low as possible for families. ""It serves children from very large families so it could be that it is cheaper to feed them here than at home,"" she says. ""We can offer a variation of foods too. It certainly supports our parents who need to go out to work."" Gemma Bull is struggling to save a house deposit due to the cost of living Gemma Bull, a teaching assistant at the school, says she is having to prioritise where they buy food from and shop around at different supermarkets because of price hikes. She has four children at the school and has seen her weekly food bill more than double. ""Children are resilient, especially at our school, parents as well,"" she says. ""Being able to offer breakfast club and after school clubs helps the parents. After school clubs are free and that helps parents in our community."" Noor NanjiBBC News Karen Betts, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, believes everybody is going to see the price of

BBC, she says food manufacturers are ""doing everything they can""
to try to contain price rises. ""Our

Betts knows food and drink companies are ""cutting costs

He refers to the fact that hiscost of living payment,externalis lower than for those on other types of benefit. A: In September, people like Chris on disability benefits such as DLA or PIP will receive a Â£150 cost of living payment. That is designed to reflect the higher energy costs many people with disabilities face. The Â£150 payment is not dependent on income. Those who also receive other so-called means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit,will receive the Â£650 payment on top. (Note that the Â£650 is paid in two instalments.) The adequacy of these payments is hotly-debated - not least because domestic energy bills from October are now forecast to be even higher than previously thought. One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more. Analysts say the Bank of England is under pressure to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting in August. But it's a tough balancing act, as the Bank does not want to slow the economy too much. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. They currently stand at 1.25%. Read more about interest rates here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Q: BarrieTuckerasks: Why has the Bank of England ""sat on its hands"", waiting to hike interest rates in August? A:Interest rates are set by the Bank of Englandâs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) â a collection of nine economists. They meet eight times a year. Emergency rate rises are very rare, so the calendar is set, and their next decision will be made on 4 August. Some commentators agree - to a degree - with Barrie, arguing that the Bank rate should have been pushed higher, earlier. Last night, the Bankâs governor, Andrew Bailey, said the MPC was committed to doing what it can to get inflation back to its 2% target.That could include raising the Bank rate from 1.25% to 1.75% in August. The Bank rate affects consumers in what they pay on loans, including mortgages, and what they receive in savings rates. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent We've been taking a number of your questions on the latest inflation rate rise. Q: John Blanning asks: Why some prices are going up, when they have nothing to do with
increases in the cost of grain? A:Prices
are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as a result of a range of, often
complex, factors. The
rising cost of fuel is one of those elements, as is the soaring price of
energy, in part owing to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine. Remember
that, while households in England, Wales and Scotland have an energy price cap,
businesses do not. Raw
material costs are also going up, often because of high demand as activity
increased after Covid. Businesses in some sectors are also having to pay higher
wages to attract staff. All
this feeds through to higher prices paid by consumers. You

increase in their prices, businesswomen like Jennifer are having to think of
smart ways to cope with the cost of living. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The soaring cost of living means families are looking closely at their budgets, the resilience of their finances, and whether they have savings tucked away. Lloyds Banking Group boss Charlie Nunnrecently told BBC News that most customers have less than Â£500 of savings in their account. The dilemma now is that savings are needed to deal with unexpected costs and bills as prices rise, but inflation is eating away at the value of those savings. Financial information service Moneyfacts says interest rates offered by savings providers are improving, but â for an easy access savings account â the best rate is 1.6%. This is well below the inflation rate of 9.4%. Rachel says her family is facing increasing energy and childcare costs With many families struggling with soaring prices,a community food
project in Derbyshireis helping people save money on their weekly shop.
For a membership fee of Â£5 people can get around Â£50 worth of food. Rachel, who has two children, lost her job as a childminderduring the pandemic and although she is now working part-time she says the family is still finding things tough. ""We live
hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings,"" she says. ""So we're just living with
whatever comes in, it
goes out on bills and on food and on looking after the children."" Rachel says the community pantry is a massive help and is also encouraging her children to eat more fruit and vegetables. Sue has been using the food pantry for three weeks Sue Stephens also uses the pantry and says it has cut her food bill by Â£30-Â£40. At first she says she was embarrassed to ask for help. ""I felt like I was sort of gonna be scrounging I think if I came you know, because I work and I thought I shouldn't really be coming,"" she says. ""But no, they said that's fine... because everybody's feeling the pinch."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Julie, a parent carer for her disabled teenage daughter, receives Universal Credit and Carer's Allowance. She asks why the Â£650 cost of living payment is not given to those in receipt of Carer's Allowance. Julie is not the only carer to have raised this point. Somebody receiving Carerâs Allowance is not automatically
eligible for the Â£650 cost of living payment, which comes in two instalments.
Charities say several hundred thousand carers will miss out. However, the government points out that 60% of working age
people who get Carerâs Allowance will qualify for the payment because they are
in a household which receives other types of mean-tested benefits, such as
Universal Credit. Iâve written an article on eligibility for cost of living payments here. It is also worth
stressing that some ""hidden"" carers who are entitled to Carer's
Allowance do not claim it, so if you care for someone for at least 35 hours a
week, it is worth checking. The issue of inflation was raised in the Commons earlier - during the final Prime Minister's Questions for Boris Johnson. Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked the PM's track record on the economy - quoting Tory leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt as saying what's been going on ""isn't working"".

"Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year highThe prices of fuel and food climbed in June, latest figures show.Business","Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, while costs for milk, cheese and eggs also climbed, the ONS said. Unions have been calling for pay rises to help workers cope as the rising cost of living eats into household budgets. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by the European Union to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices stood at 184p per litre in June, the ONS said, the highest since records began in 1990 and up from 129.7p a year earlier. The monthly rise was also the largest on record. The average price of diesel in June was 192.4p per litre, again a record high, the ONS said. It led to the said average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel were leading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Elsewhere, food prices have been climbing, with costs increasing at the fastest rate since March 2009. Milk, cheese and eggs saw the biggest rises in June, latest figures show, with the prices of vegetables, meat and ready meals also up. Your device may not support this visualisation Research firm Kantar has predicted supermarket bills are set to rise by an average of Â£454 this year. This comes as energy bills, which rose by an unprecedented Â£700 a year in April for a typical household, are forecast to climb again in October. Prices charged in restaurants and for accommodation have also increased, climbing by 8.6% in the year to June, the ONS said. Christine and Mel Simpson fear how bad inflation will get this winter Christine and Mel Simpson from Derby receive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" Mel told the BBC. Meanwhile, Rachel, who uses the Community Pantry on Hurst Farm in Derbyshire where you pay Â£5 for membership and can do a shop worth about Â£50, said the service had made a massive difference for her family, especially after she lost her job as a childminder during the pandemic. ""We live hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings. We've tried to cut down on like the heating and the water bills, we're very careful what we use each day."" Other countries around the world are also experiencing a cost of living squeeze, with many affected by the same global factors as the UK. However, the UK's inflation rate is currently higher than then US and others in Europe, with the latest estimates of annual inflation for Germany at 8.2% and for France at 6.5%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the two main causes of inflation globally were surging energy prices and worker shortages. But he said: ""The euro-zone has the first factor but not really the second. The US has the second factor, but not really the first. The UK has both. That's why inflation is highest in the UK."" EU governments had also ""done more to prevent"" higher wholesale gas and electricity prices being passed onto households, he added. And while the UK's labour market was ""just as tight as in the US"", it appeared UK workers were ""more able to bargain for higher wages"", which could fuel further inflation. Mr Dales said the ""combined influence"" of Brexit and the pandemic had resulted in shortages of workers, due to fewer workers coming to the UK from overseas and a greater share of people of working age ""have either become unable to work or decided they no longer want to or need to work"". As Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in his Mansion House speech on Tuesday night, the inflationary pressures on the economy are no longer just global, they are domestic too. The labour force has shrunk, making it harder to recruit and pushing up wages. ""This increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressure, "" he said. The headline inflation rate in the UK is already the highest of the advanced G7 economies. And much criticism has come the Bank of England's way in the Conservative leadership campaign. But labour shortages are far more directly under government policy control and yet they are barely being discussed in the leadership debate. The higher rates of inflation will make the conversation with public sector workers yet more tense. And all roads appear to lead to a rise in base interest rates next month of half a percentage point - the biggest rise in nearly three decades. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the Bank of England to ""bear down on inflation"". ""Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK,"" he said. But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said rising inflation could push family finances ""to the brink"" after a decade of slow wage growth. ""It's the result of a decade of Tory mismanagement of our economy meaning living standards and real wages have failed to grow,"" she said. On Tuesday, the government announced that the police and most NHS staff would get below-inflation pay rises. It has consistently said that big wage increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up causing a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", but Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the announcements were ""a kick in the teeth"". Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said rising prices were ""wiping out pay increases"", adding there ""cost of living crisis is only worsening"". The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said rates could rise by as much as 0.5 percentage points at its next rates meeting in August in a bid to stem rising prices. That would take them to 1.75%.

LiveLiveInflation jumps to 9.4% as petrol pushes prices up2 minutes ago,"UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - jumps to 9.4% in the year to June Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, driven by petrol, energy and food costs Poorer household are being hit harder by rising costs, the Resolution Foundation think tank warns However, the government is confident we will see a ""marked improvement"" in 2023, a treasury minister says Labour pushes for urgent action from the government, calling for it to take VAT off energy bills We are answering some of your questions on the rising rate inflation rate and the cost of living And, as part of our Counting the Cost of Living series, BBC News will be asking people from towns and cities around the UK how they are coping - and revisiting them over the coming months We're starting today in the Midlands with Derby, hearing from households, businesses and families Edited by Nathan Williams That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage. Today's page was edited by Nathan Williams and Owen Amos and written by Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Katie Thompson and Thomas Mackintosh. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, so here's a reminder of the main developments today: Disruption caused by strike action on the railways is set to continue The UK is experiencing a ""summer of discontent"", with strike action happening amid the cost-of-living crisis. The latest jump in the inflation rate is just the start of a ""financial
catastrophe"", according to consumer champion Martin Lewis. Household fuel bills are set to ""rocket"" following a change to
the energy price cap in the autumn, he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One
programme. The Money Saving Expert founder calls the timing of the Conservative
leadership contest ""devastating"". He says millions of people will be
hit by energy bill hikes not long after a new prime minister is in office. Lewis claims fuel discounts announced by the government in May are ""no
longer fit for purpose"" because they were based on an underestimate of how
much prices would rise. He calls for a
change in the way the energy price cap is regulated â or for the tax system to
take on the financial burden. Christine and Mel are worried prices will rise more InDerby, pensioners Christine and Mel Simpsonreceive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" says Mel. Beverley says many people are struggling in Derbyshire Beverley Parkeris chief executive of the charity Rural Action Derbyshire, which aims to tackle disadvantage in rural communities. She says as the cost of living has gone up, people are having to make difficult choices about what they spend their money on. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges, which doesn't really help from an energy saving point of view because the biggest part of your bill is the standing charge, but they think it will. ""It's a massive risk and we've heard of people getting food poisoning from eating food that's not been stored correctly."" Public transport in rural areas can also be expensive. ""We've heard of people walking six miles to the food bank and six miles home,"" she says, because they can't afford the bus. Throughout today we've been bringing you reaction to the latest interest rate hike from Derby. The city is unique to its residents but itâs also quite average in various ways, making it a fairly typical example of whatâs happening in the UK with the cost of living crisis. We have middle-class families with parents employed by big firms like Rolls-Royce and Toyota but also record numbers using foodbanks. In comparison to other places, salaries compare favourably to house prices, but many are struggling. Located in the Midlands, being on the Midland Mainline and CrossCountry line and just off the M1, Derby is well connected. It doesnât have the wealth or expense of bigger cities but nor does it have the unemployment issues seen elsewhere. Lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their money on essentials like heating As the cost-of-living crisis bites, the Resolution
Foundation claims the UKâs very top earners have seen their pay rise above
inflation â while those at the bottom have seen theirs cut in real terms by 6%. The result is a growth in the âwealth gapâ, says Jack
Leslie, a senior economist at the think tank, which ""focuses on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes"". âThe better-off are doing particularly well at the moment,â
Leslie tells BBC Radio 4âs World at One programme. Lower-income groups
spend a higher proportion of their income on essentials like food and heating â
so inflation hits them hardest, Leslie says. Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent Food price increases are relentless for people in therural
Perthshire village of Pitlochry. But this community is helping each other out with free food
supplies in an open shed. Allan Chilton, 30, arrived to grab some eggs off the shelves
before heading to the supermarket for his weekly supplies. It saves him a few
pounds. Every penny counts with household pressures mounting. The quirky idea, known as the ""community larder"", is open 24
hours a day allowing people to come anytime. Itâs a two way process too with folk dropping off any excess
food they arenât planning on using. Clodagh RiceNorthern Ireland business correspondent Businesses are also facing huge cost increases - forcing many to hike their own prices for customers. Wilson's Country, a leadingpotato processor based in Portadown, Northern Ireland, is being hit by soaring energy costs. Managing director Lewis Cunningham says: ""Our electricity
now compared to 2021 has doubled, and at one stage in the Ukraine war in
February and March it tripled. ""And it's a very difficult cost to reduce as we
need to have the machines on, we need to wash potatoes, pack potatoes and chill
potatoes - and even more concerning is what the autumn might bring.â âUnfortunately the costs have been elevated now at such a
high level with no outlook on the horizon of any costs reducing that we are
having to pass these costs on [to customers],"" he adds. Jacqui Trowsdale says the school is being stretched due to a rise in demand for school meals Deputy headteacher ofAllenton Community Primary School in Derby, Jacqui Trowsdale,says demand for school meals is up by 30% - with a massive increase in breakfast club in particular. It's gone from having 60 children to more than 90. That's because they try to keep prices as low as possible for families. ""It serves children from very large families so it could be that it is cheaper to feed them here than at home,"" she says. ""We can offer a variation of foods too. It certainly supports our parents who need to go out to work."" Gemma Bull is struggling to save a house deposit due to the cost of living Gemma Bull, a teaching assistant at the school, says she is having to prioritise where they buy food from and shop around at different supermarkets because of price hikes. She has four children at the school and has seen her weekly food bill more than double. ""Children are resilient, especially at our school, parents as well,"" she says. ""Being able to offer breakfast club and after school clubs helps the parents. After school clubs are free and that helps parents in our community.""

Tories in last vote before leadership run-offConservative MPs will decide on the two candidates to be put to a ballot of party members.UK Politics,"Voting has closed in the final Tory MPs' ballot to select the two leadership candidates to be put to a vote of party members. Only Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Liz Truss remain in the race after Kemi Badenoch was eliminated on Tuesday. Mr Sunak is still the frontrunner, with Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss vying for the second spot in the final round. MPs finished voting at 1500 BST, with a result expected to be announced around 1600. Conservative Party members will then vote over the summer to pick the winner, with a result to be announced on 5 September.

"Prices continue to rise at fastest rate for 40 yearsThe price fuel, along with milk and eggs climbed in June, the Office for National Statistics says.Business","Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, while costs for milk, cheese and eggs also climbed, the ONS said. Unions have been calling for pay rises to help workers cope as the rising cost of living eats into household budgets. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by the European Union to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices stood at 184p per litre in June, the ONS said, the highest since records began in 1990 and up from 129.7p a year earlier. The monthly rise was also the largest on record. The average price of diesel in June was 192.4p per litre, again a record high, the ONS said. It led to the said average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel were leading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Elsewhere, food prices have been climbing, with costs increasing at the fastest rate since March 2009. Milk, cheese and eggs saw the biggest rises in June, latest figures show, with the prices of vegetables, meat and ready meals also up. Your device may not support this visualisation Research firm Kantar has predicted supermarket bills are set to rise by an average of Â£454 this year. This comes as energy bills, which rose by an unprecedented Â£700 a year in April for a typical household, are forecast to climb again in October. Prices charged in restaurants and for accommodation have also increased, climbing by 8.6% in the year to June, the ONS said. Christine and Mel Simpson fear how bad inflation will get this winter Christine and Mel Simpson from Derby receive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" Mel told the BBC. Meanwhile, Rachel, who uses the Community Pantry on Hurst Farm in Derbyshire where you pay Â£5 for membership and can do a shop worth about Â£50, said the service had made a massive difference for her family, especially after she lost her job as a childminder during the pandemic. ""We live hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings. We've tried to cut down on like the heating and the water bills, we're very careful what we use each day."" Other countries around the world are also experiencing a cost of living squeeze, with many affected by the same global factors as the UK. However, the UK's inflation rate is currently higher than then US and others in Europe, with the latest estimates of annual inflation for Germany at 8.2% and for France at 6.5%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the two main causes of inflation globally were surging energy prices and worker shortages. But he said: ""The euro-zone has the first factor but not really the second. The US has the second factor, but not really the first. The UK has both. That's why inflation is highest in the UK."" EU governments had also ""done more to prevent"" higher wholesale gas and electricity prices being passed onto households, he added. And while the UK's labour market was ""just as tight as in the US"", it appeared UK workers were ""more able to bargain for higher wages"", which could fuel further inflation. Mr Dales said the ""combined influence"" of Brexit and the pandemic had resulted in shortages of workers, due to fewer workers coming to the UK from overseas and a greater share of people of working age ""have either become unable to work or decided they no longer want to or need to work"". As Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in his Mansion House speech on Tuesday night, the inflationary pressures on the economy are no longer just global, they are domestic too. The labour force has shrunk, making it harder to recruit and pushing up wages. ""This increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressure, "" he said. The headline inflation rate in the UK is already the highest of the advanced G7 economies. And much criticism has come the Bank of England's way in the Conservative leadership campaign. But labour shortages are far more directly under government policy control and yet they are barely being discussed in the leadership debate. The higher rates of inflation will make the conversation with public sector workers yet more tense. And all roads appear to lead to a rise in base interest rates next month of half a percentage point - the biggest rise in nearly three decades. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the Bank of England to ""bear down on inflation"". ""Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK,"" he said. But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said rising inflation could push family finances ""to the brink"" after a decade of slow wage growth. ""It's the result of a decade of Tory mismanagement of our economy meaning living standards and real wages have failed to grow,"" she said. On Tuesday, the government announced that the police and most NHS staff would get below-inflation pay rises. It has consistently said that big wage increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up causing a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", but Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the announcements were ""a kick in the teeth"". Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said rising prices were ""wiping out pay increases"", adding there ""cost of living crisis is only worsening"". The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said rates could rise by as much as 0.5 percentage points at its next rates meeting in August in a bid to stem rising prices. That would take them to 1.75%.

Tories in last vote before leadership run-off,"Voting has closed in the final Tory MPs' ballot to select the two leadership candidates to be put to a vote of party members. Only Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Liz Truss remain in the race after Kemi Badenoch was eliminated on Tuesday. Mr Sunak is still the frontrunner, with Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss vying for the second spot in the final round. MPs finished voting at 1500 BST, with a result expected to be announced around 1600. Conservative Party members will then vote over the summer to pick the winner, with a result to be announced on 5 September. The previous round, on Tuesday, saw Mr Sunak gain the support of three MPs, to bring his total to 118. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? The surprising joviality of Tory leadership votes Kemi Badenoch fails to make final three in Tory leadership contest Ms Mordaunt gained 10 votes to bring her total to 92, while Ms Truss gained 15 to close the gap and bring her total to 86. Ms Badenoch gained one vote to reach 59 overall, but remained in last place and was knocked out of the contest. Which of Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss makes it to the final two is now likely to depend on who can attract the most support from those MPs who supported Ms Badenoch. One of them, Ben Bradley, said he thought Ms Badenoch's voters could go ""in all directions"" and that he had not yet decided whom to back on Wednesday. Writing in the Telegraph,,externalMs Truss said she was the ""only person who can deliver the change - in line with true Conservative principles"", while Mr Sunak's campaign has argued he is the candidate who could beat Labour. On Wednesday morning, a source from Ms Mordaunt's campaign said: ""Penny's been speaking with colleagues already this morning and so many of Tom and Kemi's backers are calling out for change. As the only one not in Johnson's cabinet, Penny is the sole MP left in the race who offers a genuine fresh start."" The campaigns have also accused one another of transferring votes to their rivals as part of a strategy to improve their own position. Speaking to LBC Radio, former cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Ms Mordaunt, said it was the ""dirtiest campaign"" he had ever seen. ""Rishi [Sunak] just reallocated some... He wants to fight Liz, because she's the person who will lose the debate with him,"" he said. Meanwhile Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the remaining contenders for having ""racked up Â£330bn of unfunded spending commitments"" in tax pledges. Speaking at Boris Johnson's final Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader quoted comments by the contenders criticising the current government's record. ""I think the message coming out of this leadership contest is pretty clear - they got us into this mess, and they've no idea how to get us out of it,"" he added. But the prime minister hit back, saying any of the candidates would ""wipe the floor"" with him at PMQs ""like some household detergent"". There has been day after day of smiles and visions, promises and hustings. But it now boils down to a final vote of Conservative MPs here, between 1pm and 3pm this afternoon, to decide which two of the three remaining candidates get a golden ticket to the run off vote among Tory party members. Right now, the final realignment is underway. Votes are fluid. Even if a candidate's numbers don't appear to move much between votes, they can still have gained some and lost others. Chris Mason: Real jeopardy as Tories pick final two Ahead of Wednesday's vote, Mr Sunak announced a policy of making the UK self-sufficient in energy production by 2045. The ex-chancellor said he would scrap plans to relax a ban on new onshore wind farms, and would instead focus on offshore turbines. Ms Mordaunt meanwhile has pledged to make it easier for renters to get a mortgage by requiring lenders to take into account rental payments when considering their credit history. A YouGov survey of 725 party members on Monday and Tuesday suggested Mr Sunak would lose to either Ms Mordaunt or Ms Truss in a head-to-head. The poll had Ms Mordaunt beating Mr Sunak by 51% to 37% and Ms Truss beating him by 54% to 35%. The current size of the Tory party membership is not known for certain, but at the last leadership election in 2019 it was around 160,000, and is thought to have grown since. The Conservative website says members can expect to receive their ballot papers between 1 to 5 August. The deadline for voting - which can be done by post or online - is 17:00 BST on 2 September.

Prices continue to rise at fastest rate for 40 years,"Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, while costs for milk, cheese and eggs also climbed, the ONS said. Unions have been calling for pay rises to help workers cope as the rising cost of living eats into household budgets. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by the European Union to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices stood at 184p per litre in June, the ONS said, the highest since records began in 1990 and up from 129.7p a year earlier. The monthly rise was also the largest on record. The average price of diesel in June was 192.4p per litre, again a record high, the ONS said. It led to the said average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel were leading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Elsewhere, food prices have been climbing, with costs increasing at the fastest rate since March 2009. Milk, cheese and eggs saw the biggest rises in June, latest figures show, with the prices of vegetables, meat and ready meals also up. Your device may not support this visualisation Research firm Kantar has predicted supermarket bills are set to rise by an average of Â£454 this year. This comes as energy bills, which rose by an unprecedented Â£700 a year in April for a typical household, are forecast to climb again in October. Prices charged in restaurants and for accommodation have also increased, climbing by 8.6% in the year to June, the ONS said. Christine and Mel Simpson fear how bad inflation will get this winter Christine and Mel Simpson from Derby receive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" Mel told the BBC. Meanwhile, Rachel, who uses the Community Pantry on Hurst Farm in Derbyshire where you pay Â£5 for membership and can do a shop worth about Â£50, said the service had made a massive difference for her family, especially after she lost her job as a childminder during the pandemic. ""We live hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings. We've tried to cut down on like the heating and the water bills, we're very careful what we use each day."" Other countries around the world are also experiencing a cost of living squeeze, with many affected by the same global factors as the UK. However, the UK's inflation rate is currently higher than then US and others in Europe, with the latest estimates of annual inflation for Germany at 8.2% and for France at 6.5%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the two main causes of inflation globally were surging energy prices and worker shortages. But he said: ""The euro-zone has the first factor but not really the second. The US has the second factor, but not really the first. The UK has both. That's why inflation is highest in the UK."" EU governments had also ""done more to prevent"" higher wholesale gas and electricity prices being passed onto households, he added. And while the UK's labour market was ""just as tight as in the US"", it appeared UK workers were ""more able to bargain for higher wages"", which could fuel further inflation. Mr Dales said the ""combined influence"" of Brexit and the pandemic had resulted in shortages of workers, due to fewer workers coming to the UK from overseas and a greater share of people of working age ""have either become unable to work or decided they no longer want to or need to work"". As Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in his Mansion House speech on Tuesday night, the inflationary pressures on the economy are no longer just global, they are domestic too. The labour force has shrunk, making it harder to recruit and pushing up wages. ""This increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressure, "" he said. The headline inflation rate in the UK is already the highest of the advanced G7 economies. And much criticism has come the Bank of England's way in the Conservative leadership campaign. But labour shortages are far more directly under government policy control and yet they are barely being discussed in the leadership debate. The higher rates of inflation will make the conversation with public sector workers yet more tense. And all roads appear to lead to a rise in base interest rates next month of half a percentage point - the biggest rise in nearly three decades. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the Bank of England to ""bear down on inflation"". ""Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK,"" he said. But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said rising inflation could push family finances ""to the brink"" after a decade of slow wage growth. ""It's the result of a decade of Tory mismanagement of our economy meaning living standards and real wages have failed to grow,"" she said. On Tuesday, the government announced that the police and most NHS staff would get below-inflation pay rises. It has consistently said that big wage increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up causing a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", but Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the announcements were ""a kick in the teeth"". Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said rising prices were ""wiping out pay increases"", adding there ""cost of living crisis is only worsening"". The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said rates could rise by as much as 0.5 percentage points at its next rates meeting in August in a bid to stem rising prices. That would take them to 1.75%.

Sri Lankan MPs vote for new president amid crisis,"Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected by parliament Sri Lankan MPs have elected prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the country's new president, despite his unpopularity with the public. Mr Wickremesinghe faces the task of leading the country out of its economic collapse and restoring order after months of mass protests. He roundly defeated his main rival for the job, Dullus Alahapperuma, with 134 votes to 82 in a parliamentary vote. Sri Lanka's ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week. He bolted to the Maldives and then Singapore after thousands of protesters stormed his presidential residences and other government buildings, calling for his resignation. They had also called for the resignation of Mr Wickremesinghe, a close ally of the Rajapaksa political family who was appointed prime minister in May. Protesters last week burnt down his private home and also stormed his prime ministerial office in Colombo in demonstrations against his leadership. On Wednesday, many expressed despair and disappointment over his win. ""I am absolutely disgusted at the resultâ¦ I cannot believe that 134 people - MPs that are supposed to represent the people-  have completely disregarded the wants of the people,"" one activist Jeana De Zoysa told the BBC. Protesters and people on new president Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? The hard choices Sri Lankans must make now Mr Wickremesinghe is viewed by many as a shrewd political operator who's managed to cling on in parliament despite his party being wiped out in the 2020 election. It failed to win a single constituency, and its only seat - for which Mr Wickremesinghe nominated himself - was awarded under the party list system reflecting overall votes polled. A former six-time prime minister, he failed in his previous two runs for the presidency. His victory on Wednesday means he will serve out the rest of the presidential term until November 2024. But on Wednesday, after sweeping the vote with the backing of the Rajapaksa's ruling party, he called for unity and bipartisanship moving forward. He told parliament the nation was ""in a very difficult situation"" and there were ""big challenges ahead"". Sri Lanka has been wracked with protests for months because the country is effectively bankrupt and facing acute shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Wickremesinghe is aiming to restore political stability so the country can resume negotiations with the International Monetary fund for a bailout package. He was involved in these talks last month, and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramnua (SLPP) party said most of their members had backed him because of his economic credentials. ""We feel that Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only person with the experience, the know-how and the capacity to provide solutions to the economic crisis,"" General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam told the Reuters news agency. However, it remains unclear whether he will be accepted by protesters - many of whom say he's part of the political elite behind the country's economic mismanagement. On Wednesday, ahead of the results, barricades were set up around the parliament and soldiers lined the perimeter anticipating crowds. Barricades were set up in front of parliament ahead of Wednesday's vote But protesters remained fairly subdued. After the result, some gathered at the Galle Face Green protest site chanted ""Ranil Go Home"". There are fears among some that Mr Wickremesinghe will now crack down on the movement, which has brought hundreds of thousands of ordinary people onto the streets demanding change. When he assumed the job of acting president last week, he ordered the military to do whatever was necessary to restore public order, following protesters storming and occupying government buildings. He also extended a national state of emergency order this week to stamp out any flare-ups. However, his immediate challenges include sourcing fuel supplies and managing the public discontent - which will mean working on removing the bitterness, anger and disappointment within society. His main challenger in Wednesday's vote was Mr Alahapperuma, a dissident MP in the ruling party who gained the backing of the main opposition. He had pledged to bring a cross-party government to Sri Lanka that would ""put an end to the deceitful political culture"" but failed to muster enough support. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Is the UK doing more to tackle bills than other nations?,"Energy bills have been rising for households across Europe as prices have been driven up by worries about gas and oil supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Individual countries, and the European Union (EU), have announced support schemes for consumers. Here's what they're doing: In 2021, the EU imported 40% of its gas from Russia - so many of its member states are exposed to high energy prices. In response, the EU is introducing: A cap on gas prices if they exceed â¬180 per megawatt hour for three days running, from February 2022. A ""solidarity levy"" - a windfall tax - on excess profits made by oil, gas, coal and refinery companies in 2022. A cap on the revenues of electricity companies which produce energy from wind, solar and nuclear. These revenues have risen as the price of electricity from these sources is linked to soaring gas prices - the cap is expected to raise â¬140 billion (Â£121bn). A mandatory reduction of electricity consumption in peak hours by 5% across the EU, until March 2023. A voluntary reduction of 10% of overall electricity consumption - individual countries will decide how to to this. In October, the German parliament approved a ""defensive shield"" package worth â¬200bn (Â£175bn). It includesa cap on gas and electricity prices for households and some businessesfrom early next year. The government will pay December's monthly gas bill for all households and small-to-medium businesses. In September and October, all taxpayers received a one-off energy payment â¬300. There has been extra help for people on benefits. Public transport tickets are being subsidised. Germany is trying tocut energy consumption,externalby: Heating public buildings to a maximum of 19C, with exceptions for places like hospitals Turning off hot water for washing hands in public buildings Lighting limits for buildings, monuments and advertising A windfall tax on energy companies will be applied from December 2022 to the end of June 2023. In January, the government forced the state-owned energy provider, ÃlectricitÃ© de France (EDF), to cap price rises at 4% for a year. It says it will cap rises in gas and electricity at 15% for 2023, as part of a â¬45bn (Â£39bn) scheme to support households and businesses. France had already announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment last year to 5.8 million households receiving energy vouchers. The government plans to reduce energy consumption by 10% by: Capping indoor temperatures at 19C for public buildings Cutting the temperature of public sports facilities by 2C and in public swimming pools by 1C Paying civil servants an extra â¬2.88 per day to work from home, if this allows government buildings to close Speed limits on ski lifts and producing less artificial snow The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in the 2023 budget. France is cutting the temperature in public swimming polls by 1C Italy is expecting to spend about â¬49.5bn (Â£42bn). Its measures include a â¬200 (Â£169) one-off payment to people earning â¬35,000 (Â£29,600) a year or less, and a 20% tax credit for all energy-intensive companies experiencing a 30% rise in prices. The Italian government is also trying to reduce gas consumption by: Asking people to turn central heating down by 1C and turn it off for an extra hour every day Limiting heating in public buildings, with exceptions for hospitals, nurseries and some industries The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in 2023. Since November, electricity and gas prices for households have been capped at January 2022 levels - up to a certain amount of consumption. Any extra use will be charged at market rates. The government is also offering a discount of â¬190 on energy bills in November and December to all households. There is a one-off energy allowance of â¬1,300 to those on lower incomes. VAT on energy bills and tax on petrol and diesel have also been cut. The Dutch government is also introducing: a higher minimum wage lower income tax higher benefits and allowances (such as child benefit, student grants and tax credits) It is expecting to spend â¬15.5bn (Â£13.5bn) on these measures. The Dutch government isadvising households and business,externalto cut consumption, including by turning down heating by 1C. The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies. Spain has cut VAT on energy bills and reduced tax on electricity. Spain and Portugal have introduced a price cap for gas - which will last for one year and aims to halve gas bills for 40% of customers in the two countries. There is also a one-off payment of â¬200 euros for people in Spain who earn less than â¬14,000 a year and are not already receiving benefits. Spain's measures are expected to cost about â¬27bn (Â£23bn). The government has an energy-saving plan which includes limiting air conditioning in public buildings and shops in the summer and keeping heating to 19C in the winter. It wants shops to close their doors when the heating is on and says they should switch off lights after 22:00. The government is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies and banks over the next two years. It has announced plans for an energy price support package for households, worth 26.8bn zlotys (Â£4.8bn). It incudes freezing energy prices for 2023 at this year's level, with a limit of 2,000 kWh per year for most households. There will be higher thresholds for households with people with disabilities and for families with three or more children. The government has abolished VAT on food, gas and fertilizer and reduced it on petrol, diesel and energy bills. There is also a new mandatory 10% electricity saving for national and local government public administrations. Households that reduce electricity use by 10% in 2023 compared with 2022, will be rewarded with an additional discount. Norway has set a maximum price that households should pay for their energy - anything over this, the government will pay 80% of the bill. A new package of loans and subsidies for businesses was announced in September. This will cover companies that spend more than 3% of revenue on power costs. The government has also proposed new taxes on onshore wind and hydropower energy, to redistribute some of the huge increase in profits over the past year. The UK government has brought in a cap on the price of a unit of energy until April 2023, which will mean the typical household bill for gas and electricity will be Â£2,500 a year. This is being extended to April 2024, but typical bills will be capped at Â£3,000 a year. There will be more support for those on benefits and for pensions households. How does the energy price cap work? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills The government brought in a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms' profits which is expected to raise Â£5bn a year. This is being increased and extended. Previously, the government introduced anenergy bill discount of Â£400for every household with some extra support for people on benefits. The UK government launched a public information campaign on how to save energy in November, which was later than other countries in Europe.

Today's page was edited by Nathan Williams and Owen Amos and written by Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Katie Thompson and Thomas Mackintosh. We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, so here's a reminder of the main developments today: Disruption caused by strike action on the railways is set to continue The UK is experiencing a ""summer of discontent"", with strike action happening amid the cost-of-living crisis. The latest jump in the inflation rate is just the start of a ""financial
catastrophe"", according to consumer champion Martin Lewis. Household fuel bills are set to ""rocket"" following a change to
the energy price cap in the autumn, he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One
programme. The Money Saving Expert founder calls the timing of the Conservative
leadership contest ""devastating"". He says millions of people will be
hit by energy bill hikes not long after a new prime minister is in office. Lewis claims fuel discounts announced by the government in May are ""no
longer fit for purpose"" because they were based on an underestimate of how
much prices would rise. He calls for a
change in the way the energy price cap is regulated â or for the tax system to
take on the financial burden. Christine and Mel are worried prices will rise more InDerby, pensioners Christine and Mel Simpsonreceive food parcels when they need them from a local food hub. But they worry that things will get worse later in the year. ""I think it depends on how severe the winter's going to be and how much inflation's going to be. Balancing the two out - we just don't know,"" says Mel. Beverley says many people are struggling in Derbyshire Beverley Parkeris chief executive of the charity Rural Action Derbyshire, which aims to tackle disadvantage in rural communities. She says as the cost of living has gone up, people are having to make difficult choices about what they spend their money on. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges, which doesn't really help from an energy saving point of view because the biggest part of your bill is the standing charge, but they think it will. ""It's a massive risk and we've heard of people getting food poisoning from eating food that's not been stored correctly."" Public transport in rural areas can also be expensive. ""We've heard of people walking six miles to the food bank and six miles home,"" she says, because they can't afford the bus. Throughout today we've been bringing you reaction to the latest interest rate hike from Derby. The city is unique to its residents but itâs also quite average in various ways, making it a fairly typical example of whatâs happening in the UK with the cost of living crisis. We have middle-class families with parents employed by big firms like Rolls-Royce and Toyota but also record numbers using foodbanks. In comparison to other places, salaries compare favourably to house prices, but many are struggling. Located in the Midlands, being on the Midland Mainline and CrossCountry line and just off the M1, Derby is well connected. It doesnât have the wealth or expense of bigger cities but nor does it have the unemployment issues seen elsewhere. Lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their money on essentials like heating As the cost-of-living crisis bites, the Resolution
Foundation claims the UKâs very top earners have seen their pay rise above
inflation â while those at the bottom have seen theirs cut in real terms by 6%. The result is a growth in the âwealth gapâ, says Jack
Leslie, a senior economist at the think tank, which ""focuses on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes"". âThe better-off are doing particularly well at the moment,â
Leslie tells BBC Radio 4âs World at One programme. Lower-income groups
spend a higher proportion of their income on essentials like food and heating â
so inflation hits them hardest, Leslie says. Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent Food price increases are relentless for people in therural
Perthshire village of Pitlochry. But this community is helping each other out with free food
supplies in an open shed. Allan Chilton, 30, arrived to grab some eggs off the shelves
before heading to the supermarket for his weekly supplies. It saves him a few
pounds. Every penny counts with household pressures mounting. The quirky idea, known as the ""community larder"", is open 24
hours a day allowing people to come anytime. Itâs a two way process too with folk dropping off any excess
food they arenât planning on using. Clodagh RiceNorthern Ireland business correspondent Businesses are also facing huge cost increases - forcing many to hike their own prices for customers. Wilson's Country, a leadingpotato processor based in Portadown, Northern Ireland, is being hit by soaring energy costs. Managing director Lewis Cunningham says: ""Our electricity
now compared to 2021 has doubled, and at one stage in the Ukraine war in
February and March it tripled. ""And it's a very difficult cost to reduce as we
need to have the machines on, we need to wash potatoes, pack potatoes and chill
potatoes - and even more concerning is what the autumn might bring.â âUnfortunately the costs have been elevated now at such a
high level with no outlook on the horizon of any costs reducing that we are
having to pass these costs on [to customers],"" he adds. Jacqui Trowsdale says the school is being stretched due to a rise in demand for school meals Deputy headteacher ofAllenton Community Primary School in Derby, Jacqui Trowsdale,says demand for school meals is up by 30% - with a massive increase in breakfast club in particular. It's gone from having 60 children to more than 90. That's because they try to keep prices as low as possible for families. ""It serves children from very large families so it could be that it is cheaper to feed them here than at home,"" she says. ""We can offer a variation of foods too. It certainly supports our parents who need to go out to work."" Gemma Bull is struggling to save a house deposit due to the cost of living Gemma Bull, a teaching assistant at the school, says she is having to prioritise where they buy food from and shop around at different supermarkets because of price hikes. She has four children at the school and has seen her weekly food bill more than double. ""Children are resilient, especially at our school, parents as well,"" she says. ""Being able to offer breakfast club and after school clubs helps the parents. After school clubs are free and that helps parents in our community."" Noor NanjiBBC News Karen Betts, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, believes everybody is going to see the price of
their weekly shop rise. But speaking to the
BBC, she says food manufacturers are ""doing everything they can""
to try to contain price rises. ""Our
industry knows that we have a responsibility to keep food affordable and to
bear down on prices,"" she says. ""But
equally, all food manufacturers are seeing enormous rises in the costs of their
inputs, whether that's ingredients, energy, labour, raw material, and
logistics, they are all really going up in price."" Ms
Betts knows food and drink companies are ""cutting costs
internally"" to limit passing on price rises to consumers. ""But obviously that there are limits to
that,"" she explains. ""All businesses need to remain viable. And so I
think we will see price inflation continue for some months."" Q: Chris Barnes in Somerset asks why disabled people are being treated as ""third-class citizens"". He refers to the fact that hiscost of living payment,externalis lower than for those on other types of benefit. A: In September, people like Chris on disability benefits such as DLA or PIP will receive a Â£150 cost of living payment. That is designed to reflect the higher energy costs many people with disabilities face. The Â£150 payment is not dependent on income. Those who also receive other so-called means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit,will receive the Â£650 payment on top. (Note that the Â£650 is paid in two instalments.) The adequacy of these payments is hotly-debated - not least because domestic energy bills from October are now forecast to be even higher than previously thought. One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more. Analysts say the Bank of England is under pressure to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting in August. But it's a tough balancing act, as the Bank does not want to slow the economy too much. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. They currently stand at 1.25%. Read more about interest rates here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Q: BarrieTuckerasks: Why has the Bank of England ""sat on its hands"", waiting to hike interest rates in August? A:Interest rates are set by the Bank of Englandâs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) â a collection of nine economists. They meet eight times a year. Emergency rate rises are very rare, so the calendar is set, and their next decision will be made on 4 August. Some commentators agree - to a degree - with Barrie, arguing that the Bank rate should have been pushed higher, earlier. Last night, the Bankâs governor, Andrew Bailey, said the MPC was committed to doing what it can to get inflation back to its 2% target.That could include raising the Bank rate from 1.25% to 1.75% in August. The Bank rate affects consumers in what they pay on loans, including mortgages, and what they receive in savings rates. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent We've been taking a number of your questions on the latest inflation rate rise. Q: John Blanning asks: Why some prices are going up, when they have nothing to do with
increases in the cost of grain? A:Prices
are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as a result of a range of, often
complex, factors. The
rising cost of fuel is one of those elements, as is the soaring price of
energy, in part owing to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine. Remember
that, while households in England, Wales and Scotland have an energy price cap,
businesses do not. Raw
material costs are also going up, often because of high demand as activity
increased after Covid. Businesses in some sectors are also having to pay higher
wages to attract staff. All
this feeds through to higher prices paid by consumers. You

bit ofJennifer Snaith's business. She owns Bijoux Beauty inSunderlandand the
increases can be measured by one important item â rubber gloves. They used to be Â£7.99. Now, theyâre Â£17.99. ""It's not just
the money, shopping around for the best price for PPE or beauty products takes
time,"" she explains. ""Suppliers have increased delivery costs too. They used to
be included but now theyâre around Â£15 extra for next day delivery."" Her gas bills have also gone up by around 25% and in a busy
salon that uses gallons of hot water, sheâs had to change the way they work to
keep their expenses down. They closed for one day a week following the pandemic and now
itâs two, with the same amount of customers coming in. Combined with an
increase in their prices, businesswomen like Jennifer are having to think of
smart ways to cope with the cost of living. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The soaring cost of living means families are looking closely at their budgets, the resilience of their finances, and whether they have savings tucked away. Lloyds Banking Group boss Charlie Nunnrecently told BBC News that most customers have less than Â£500 of savings in their account. The dilemma now is that savings are needed to deal with unexpected costs and bills as prices rise, but inflation is eating away at the value of those savings. Financial information service Moneyfacts says interest rates offered by savings providers are improving, but â for an easy access savings account â the best rate is 1.6%. This is well below the inflation rate of 9.4%. Rachel says her family is facing increasing energy and childcare costs With many families struggling with soaring prices,a community food
project in Derbyshireis helping people save money on their weekly shop.
For a membership fee of Â£5 people can get around Â£50 worth of food. Rachel, who has two children, lost her job as a childminderduring the pandemic and although she is now working part-time she says the family is still finding things tough. ""We live
hand to mouth all the time, there's no savings,"" she says. ""So we're just living with
whatever comes in, it
goes out on bills and on food and on looking after the children."" Rachel says the community pantry is a massive help and is also encouraging her children to eat more fruit and vegetables. Sue has been using the food pantry for three weeks Sue Stephens also uses the pantry and says it has cut her food bill by Â£30-Â£40. At first she says she was embarrassed to ask for help. ""I felt like I was sort of gonna be scrounging I think if I came you know, because I work and I thought I shouldn't really be coming,"" she says. ""But no, they said that's fine... because everybody's feeling the pinch."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Julie, a parent carer for her disabled teenage daughter, receives Universal Credit and Carer's Allowance. She asks why the Â£650 cost of living payment is not given to those in receipt of Carer's Allowance. Julie is not the only carer to have raised this point. Somebody receiving Carerâs Allowance is not automatically
eligible for the Â£650 cost of living payment, which comes in two instalments.
Charities say several hundred thousand carers will miss out. However, the government points out that 60% of working age
people who get Carerâs Allowance will qualify for the payment because they are
in a household which receives other types of mean-tested benefits, such as
Universal Credit. Iâve written an article on eligibility for cost of living payments here. It is also worth
stressing that some ""hidden"" carers who are entitled to Carer's
Allowance do not claim it, so if you care for someone for at least 35 hours a
week, it is worth checking. The issue of inflation was raised in the Commons earlier - during the final Prime Minister's Questions for Boris Johnson. Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked the PM's track record on the economy - quoting Tory leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt as saying what's been going on ""isn't working"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford later described the 9.4% inflation rate as one of Johnson's ""record-breaking efforts in office"". Johnson repeatedly defended his performance, highlighting the post-Covid recovery and low unemployment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Children in care are being placed in caravansA BBC News investigation finds scores of children are being illegally placed in unregulated homes.,"One boy was placed with a company which moves children between narrowboats and caravans similar to this one Children in care are still being illegally placed in unregulated homes in England, including on narrowboats and in caravans, BBC News has learned. We found a 12-year-old boy was placed at a campsite for weeks, more than 100 miles from his siblings and school. Such placements were banned for under-16s, but there are concerns exemptions for holidays are being exploited. The Department for Education says it is Ofsted's job to prosecute companies running unlawful children's homes. Local authorities are breaking the law by placing children under the age of 16 in unregulated homes. It is also illegal for companies to run unregistered children's homes, although there are exemptions allowing firms to run placements that are not regulated, such as for holidays or leisure activities. A BBC News investigation has found such placements are being widely used. We found at least 120 children, including one child aged 10, had been placed in unregulated homes. Ofsted says these are not meant to allow the child to be moved between temporary placements, but there is no law or guidance defining these activities. Tents have previously been used by other companies. A 14-year-old boy was placed in this unregulated placement above a shop in Portsmouth The 12-year-old boy was recently placed in unregulated care for at least six weeks with a company that moves children between its narrowboats and caravans. Despite being under the care of Worcestershire County Council, he was placed in a caravan on a campsite, in Lancashire, more than 100 miles away from his siblings and his school.â¯ The boy had been moved between a number of children's homes before his most recent home was closed at short notice for staffing reasons. He was then moved into a caravan run by Bear Care Services. In contrast, his brother has been in a stable foster placement for years. When contacted by the BBC, the company said the placement was needed because of a ""massive shortage of registered provision"".â¯ It said it was operating lawfully because placements in mobile homes, such as caravans and narrowboats, do not need to be registered. However, Worcestershire County Council did not deny it was breaking the law in placing the child in an unregulated setting. It described the accommodation as a ""crisis"" placement, despite the length of his stay. The government said there was no such thing in law. The BBC has also learned of another case where a 14-year-old known to be at risk of jumping out of windows was placed without safeguards in an unregulated home above a shop. In total, the BBC received responses from 141 local authorities in England to Freedom of Information requests. More than 50 admitted placing at least 120 children in unregulated homes.â¯ Many refused to provide the real number of children placed in unregulated homes because they said the data was the personal information of the child. Some placements include restrictions on the movements and freedoms of children for their own welfare, which are occasionally granted by a High Court judge when there is no suitable accommodation available. This means highly vulnerable children are placed in homes with the least scrutiny of standards. Katharine Sacks-Jones, chief executive of Become, a charity for children in care, said the situation was ""a national scandal"". ""It's just tragic to hear that you've discovered so many children who are being placed in settings which are unsuitable for them"", she added. Carolyne Willow, director of the children's charity, Article 39, added: ""A young child moving from caravan to caravan defies understanding of what a holiday is. ""The government needs to amend the legislation to make it absolutely clear what constitutes holiday accommodation for children in care."" Unregulated children's homes banned from September Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Children as young as 11 illegally housed In 2019, BBC News revealed that an11-year-old had been placed in unregulated care, and found that older childrenfaced organised abusein homes. When the government announced its ban, Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson said: ""The BBC highlighted something that just needed to be changed."" But while placing under-16s in an unregulated home is now unlawful, no legal action has been taken against any council. The Department for Education declined to answer whether it had failed to properly legislate against the use of unregulated placements.â¯ In a statement, it said: ""Ofsted can prosecute providers operating as children's homes without the required registration and it holds local councils to account for the quality of care and accommodation they provide to vulnerable children"", it added.â¯â¯ But BBC News has learned that Ofsted has not brought any prosecutions against companies for running an unregistered children's home.â¯â¯Ofsted says it has not been provided with additional powers it was promised, such as the ability to fine providers directly. It said that local authorities faced ""significant challenges"" in finding the right homes. Have you had an experience of unregulated homes?

Fire services stretched as blazes follow 40C heat,"This video can not be played London wildfires: Family home of 27 years destroyed London's fire service had its busiest day since World War Two dealing with multiple blazes in record-breaking temperatures on Tuesday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. The capital was one of 15 areas around the UK to declare a major incident. The fires started on a day which saw a record temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Wednesday has been cooler for most but thunderstorms are forecast in central England. A yellow warning has been issued by the Met Office for heavy showers and thunderstorms which could bring disruption in eastern and south-east England on Wednesday evening. Despite falling temperatures, the weather iscontinuing to affect transport, with Network Rail advising passengers to only travel if necessary. By mid-afternoon LNER services from London to Scotland were starting up again, while trains on the East Coast Mainline resumed after a fire in Bedfordshire. Around 100 firefighters tackled a fire which destroyed homes in Wennington The fires occurred during record-breaking temperatures in the UK Images show extensive damage to buildings in the village of Wennington on the outskirts of east London Mr Khan said London Fire Brigade (LFB) received 2,600 calls as it dealt with multiple fires. He earlier told Sky News 41 properties were destroyed in London on Tuesday. In Wennington, east London, 100 firefighterstackled a blaze which destroyed several homes. LFB said two rows of terraced houses, four other homes, 12 stables and five cars were destroyed by the blaze, while one firefighter at the scene described it as ""absolute hell"". Dramatic images from the scene showed smoke billowing from buildings, some with their roofs collapsed, and extensive damage to the surrounding land. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Khan said: ""Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War. ""Normally we get 350 calls a day, on a busy day we can get up to 500 calls. Yesterday the fire service had more than 2,600 calls a day."" Are soaring temperatures linked to climate change? Is your area vulnerable to extreme heat? Check the forecast where you are The mayor has advised Londoners not to have barbecues in parks or private gardens over concerns they could set alight grass. LFB assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said he had not seen anything like the ""sheer scale across the whole of London"" as the brigade dealt with 15 major fires, and a large number of wildfires and grassland fires. The heat and dry conditions created ""the perfect scenario"" for fires to spread rapidly across grassland and woodland, with the speed a particular challenge, he said. Speaking in Wennington, he said the brigade had never before asked firefighters to operate when the temperature outside was 40C. ""We're obviously thinking very carefully about how we can be even better prepared as we move forward, because what we do know is that climate change is going to continue to pose challenges for us.""

At Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson thanked firefighters and said he had spoken with the chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council. LFB said 16 firefighters had heat-related injuries - two of whom were taken to hospital but have since been discharged. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue saidfour from their crews had been taken to hospitalbut have made a full recovery. Speaking after PMQs, Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse told MPs some of the pressure would now ease as the ""fiercest heat has subsided"" but he warned the summer was likely to bring further hot weather and the risk of wildfire remained elevated. ""That is why we are treating this heatwave as an exacting test of our national resilience and contingency planning,"" he said. Tim Stock alerted the fire brigade when he saw flames near his home in Wennington. Mr Stock, whose house was destroyed, told BBC Radio 5 Live he and his son had spotted the fire in his neighbour's garden but, despite their best efforts with a hose and watering can, had been unable to stop it spreading. ""I reckon about 15 to 20 houses might be gone or uninhabitable,"" he said. ""My house is completely gone, as is the next door neighbour's and three or four other houses along that bit."" Six houses were engulfed in flames in Barnsley The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has accused government spending cuts of hampering the fire service's ability to react. Matt Wrack, the union's general secretary, said firefighters were ""at the forefront of the climate emergency"" but, while the demands of the job were increasing, their resources had been cut by government for over a decade with 11,500 firefighter jobs cut since 2010. Speaking about the LFB, Mr Khan said he inherited closed fire stations, cancelled engines and firefighters losing jobs when he took over as mayor from Boris Johnson. He said he has been rebuilding the capital's fire service with kit and more firefighters. Phil Garrigan, who leads the National Resilience group for the National Fire Chiefs Council, said the UK must now consider what equipment it had to fight wildfires. He said most European countries where significant wildfires occur have planes or helicopters which can collect or distribute water to areas where fire is developing. Meanwhile,Just Stop Oil demonstrators climbed motorway signs on the M25, near Cobham, Surrey, to protest at the extreme temperatures in the UK. Police closed sections of the motorway and at one stage there were five-mile traffic queues approaching junction 30 in Essex, National Highways said. Just Stop Oil protesters climbed gantries over the M25 The latest Met Office provisional figures show that Scotland's record-breaking highest temperature, hit on Tuesday, washigher than first thought, with 35.1C registered at Floors Castle in Kelso. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change, and that hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Met Office chief scientist Prof Stephen Belcher said Tuesday's temperatures were striking due to the large record-breaking margin and the extensive area of the UK experiencing the severe temperatures. But ""aggressive emissions cuts"" could very sharply reduce the frequency of extreme temperatures, he told BBC News. Were you affected by Tuesday's fires?

Sri Lankan MPs to elect new president amid crisis,"Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected by parliament Sri Lankan MPs have elected prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the country's new president, despite his unpopularity with the public. Mr Wickremesinghe faces the task of leading the country out of its economic collapse and restoring order after months of mass protests. He roundly defeated his main rival for the job, Dullus Alahapperuma, with 134 votes to 82 in a parliamentary vote. Sri Lanka's ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week. He bolted to the Maldives and then Singapore after thousands of protesters stormed his presidential residences and other government buildings, calling for his resignation. They had also called for the resignation of Mr Wickremesinghe, a close ally of the Rajapaksa political family who was appointed prime minister in May. Protesters last week burnt down his private home and also stormed his prime ministerial office in Colombo in demonstrations against his leadership. On Wednesday, many expressed despair and disappointment over his win. ""I am absolutely disgusted at the resultâ¦ I cannot believe that 134 people - MPs that are supposed to represent the people-  have completely disregarded the wants of the people,"" one activist Jeana De Zoysa told the BBC. Protesters and people on new president Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? The hard choices Sri Lankans must make now Mr Wickremesinghe is viewed by many as a shrewd political operator who's managed to cling on in parliament despite his party being wiped out in the 2020 election. It failed to win a single constituency, and its only seat - for which Mr Wickremesinghe nominated himself - was awarded under the party list system reflecting overall votes polled. A former six-time prime minister, he failed in his previous two runs for the presidency. His victory on Wednesday means he will serve out the rest of the presidential term until November 2024. But on Wednesday, after sweeping the vote with the backing of the Rajapaksa's ruling party, he called for unity and bipartisanship moving forward. He told parliament the nation was ""in a very difficult situation"" and there were ""big challenges ahead"". Sri Lanka has been wracked with protests for months because the country is effectively bankrupt and facing acute shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. Mr Wickremesinghe is aiming to restore political stability so the country can resume negotiations with the International Monetary fund for a bailout package. He was involved in these talks last month, and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramnua (SLPP) party said most of their members had backed him because of his economic credentials. ""We feel that Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only person with the experience, the know-how and the capacity to provide solutions to the economic crisis,"" General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam told the Reuters news agency. However, it remains unclear whether he will be accepted by protesters - many of whom say he's part of the political elite behind the country's economic mismanagement. On Wednesday, ahead of the results, barricades were set up around the parliament and soldiers lined the perimeter anticipating crowds. Barricades were set up in front of parliament ahead of Wednesday's vote But protesters remained fairly subdued. After the result, some gathered at the Galle Face Green protest site chanted ""Ranil Go Home"". There are fears among some that Mr Wickremesinghe will now crack down on the movement, which has brought hundreds of thousands of ordinary people onto the streets demanding change. When he assumed the job of acting president last week, he ordered the military to do whatever was necessary to restore public order, following protesters storming and occupying government buildings. He also extended a national state of emergency order this week to stamp out any flare-ups. However, his immediate challenges include sourcing fuel supplies and managing the public discontent - which will mean working on removing the bitterness, anger and disappointment within society. His main challenger in Wednesday's vote was Mr Alahapperuma, a dissident MP in the ruling party who gained the backing of the main opposition. He had pledged to bring a cross-party government to Sri Lanka that would ""put an end to the deceitful political culture"" but failed to muster enough support. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Tory MPs in last vote before leadership run-off,"Voting has closed in the final Tory MPs' ballot to select the two leadership candidates to be put to a vote of party members. Only Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Liz Truss remain in the race after Kemi Badenoch was eliminated on Tuesday. Mr Sunak is still the frontrunner, with Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss vying for the second spot in the final round. MPs finished voting at 1500 BST, with a result expected to be announced around 1600. Conservative Party members will then vote over the summer to pick the winner, with a result to be announced on 5 September. The previous round, on Tuesday, saw Mr Sunak gain the support of three MPs, to bring his total to 118. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? The surprising joviality of Tory leadership votes Kemi Badenoch fails to make final three in Tory leadership contest Ms Mordaunt gained 10 votes to bring her total to 92, while Ms Truss gained 15 to close the gap and bring her total to 86. Ms Badenoch gained one vote to reach 59 overall, but remained in last place and was knocked out of the contest. Which of Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss makes it to the final two is now likely to depend on who can attract the most support from those MPs who supported Ms Badenoch. One of them, Ben Bradley, said he thought Ms Badenoch's voters could go ""in all directions"" and that he had not yet decided whom to back on Wednesday. Writing in the Telegraph,,externalMs Truss said she was the ""only person who can deliver the change - in line with true Conservative principles"", while Mr Sunak's campaign has argued he is the candidate who could beat Labour. On Wednesday morning, a source from Ms Mordaunt's campaign said: ""Penny's been speaking with colleagues already this morning and so many of Tom and Kemi's backers are calling out for change. As the only one not in Johnson's cabinet, Penny is the sole MP left in the race who offers a genuine fresh start."" The campaigns have also accused one another of transferring votes to their rivals as part of a strategy to improve their own position. Speaking to LBC Radio, former cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Ms Mordaunt, said it was the ""dirtiest campaign"" he had ever seen. ""Rishi [Sunak] just reallocated some... He wants to fight Liz, because she's the person who will lose the debate with him,"" he said. Meanwhile Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the remaining contenders for having ""racked up Â£330bn of unfunded spending commitments"" in tax pledges. Speaking at Boris Johnson's final Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader quoted comments by the contenders criticising the current government's record. ""I think the message coming out of this leadership contest is pretty clear - they got us into this mess, and they've no idea how to get us out of it,"" he added. But the prime minister hit back, saying any of the candidates would ""wipe the floor"" with him at PMQs ""like some household detergent"". There has been day after day of smiles and visions, promises and hustings. But it now boils down to a final vote of Conservative MPs here, between 1pm and 3pm this afternoon, to decide which two of the three remaining candidates get a golden ticket to the run off vote among Tory party members. Right now, the final realignment is underway. Votes are fluid. Even if a candidate's numbers don't appear to move much between votes, they can still have gained some and lost others. Chris Mason: Real jeopardy as Tories pick final two Ahead of Wednesday's vote, Mr Sunak announced a policy of making the UK self-sufficient in energy production by 2045. The ex-chancellor said he would scrap plans to relax a ban on new onshore wind farms, and would instead focus on offshore turbines. Ms Mordaunt meanwhile has pledged to make it easier for renters to get a mortgage by requiring lenders to take into account rental payments when considering their credit history. A YouGov survey of 725 party members on Monday and Tuesday suggested Mr Sunak would lose to either Ms Mordaunt or Ms Truss in a head-to-head. The poll had Ms Mordaunt beating Mr Sunak by 51% to 37% and Ms Truss beating him by 54% to 35%. The current size of the Tory party membership is not known for certain, but at the last leadership election in 2019 it was around 160,000, and is thought to have grown since. The Conservative website says members can expect to receive their ballot papers between 1 to 5 August. The deadline for voting - which can be done by post or online - is 17:00 BST on 2 September. Members are being sent their ballot papers earlier in the process than in 2019, when voters received their ballot papers two weeks before the deadline.
