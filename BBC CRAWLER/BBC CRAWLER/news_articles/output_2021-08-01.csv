Italy's Jacobs wins shock 100m gold,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Italy's Jacobs wins 100m final while Hughes disqualified Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed a shock gold in the Olympic 100m final, after Great Britain's Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for a false start. Jacobs, who only switched away from long jump in 2018, streaked clear to win in 9.80 seconds, 0.04 clear of American Fred Kerley. Canada's Andre de Grasse won a second successive Olympic bronze in third. World champion Christian Coleman and Trayvon Bromell, the world's fastest in 2021, were both absent from the final. Coleman,banned for whereabouts failuresafter missing three drugs tests, and Bromell, eliminated in the semi-finals, were joined on the sidelines by the long-retired defending champion Usain Bolt. Few would have picked Jacobs, who was born in Texas to an American father but moved to his mother's Italian homeland before his first birthday, as the Jamaican great's successor. Jacobs only broke the 10-second barrier for the first time in May. But the European indoor 60m champion carried the momentum from his fast start all the way to the line to register a time faster than Bolt's winning mark in Rio. He was greeted by compatriot Gianmarco Tamberi, who had won a joint high-jump gold just minutes before and wrapped him in the Italian flag and an embrace. ""I don't know, it's a dream, a dream, it is fantastic,"" said Jacobs. ""Maybe tomorrow I can imagine what they are saying, but today it is incredible."" Second-placed Kerley admitted Jacobs was a new name to him. ""I really didn't know anything about him. It was my first time racing him at the Monaco Diamond League [where Jacobs finished third in 9.99 seconds],"" he said. ""He did a fantastic job."" Hughes will be left to wonder what might have been in a final stripped of its usual stars and big names. His clear false start brought back memories of defending champion Linford Christie's disqualification at Atlanta 1996 and denied him a shot of joining the most prestigious honour roll in athletics. Hughes, who made the same mistake at last month's British Championships, said it was the result of a sudden cramp in his calf. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Rojas sets new world record after becoming triple jump Olympic champion The 100m final was almost overshadowed by an undercard of superb field events. Venezuela'sYulimar Rojasadded Olympic gold to her world triple-jump titles, finally claiming the world record she has threatened all season. The 25-year-old already had victory wrapped up when she approached her final attempt, with no-one able to get close to her opening-round leap of 15.41m. Despite a sub-par step phase, she still soared out to 15.67m to beat the previous 15.50m world record set two months before her birth by Inessa Kravets of Ukraine. ""Wow. It is a fantastic night,"" said Rojas. ""I knew we had that distance in my legs to get it today. I was failing a bit in the technical aspect, but the last jump was one to give everything, and it was like that."" Portugal's Patricia Mamona took silver with a personal best 15.01m, but Colombian defending champion Caterine Ibarguen could only finish 10th. There was drama of a different kind in the men's high jump. Qatar's double world championMutaz Essa Barshimand Italy'sTamberiopted to share gold rather than take part in a jump-off. Both had three failures as they attempted to match the Olympic record of 2.39m and, with error-free records on countback, they could have fought for sole possession of the title. However,the friends,externaldecided to end the contest and split the title, sparking ecstatic celebrations from Tamberi who has competed with a plaster cast at the end of his run-up as a souvenir of an Achilles injury that ruled him out of Rio 2016 and almost ended his career. Daniel Rowden missed out on a spot in the 800m final by five thousandths of a second SistersTiffany PorterandCindy Semberwere unable to make Tuesday's 100m hurdles final for Great Britain. Puerto Rico's Jasmine Camacho-Quinn threw down the gauntlet to the rest of the field as she qualified in a new Olympic record of 12.26, just 0.06secs outside the world record of American rival Kendra Harrison, who also progressed. NeitherDaniel RowdenorElliot Gilescould make Wednesday's 800m final, with Rowden missing out on a fastest loser spot by just five thousandths of a second after getting boxed in around the final bend. ""I'm very disappointed,"" said Rowden. ""I went for a gap coming into the home straight and the gap closed as soon as I went through it, I lost my stride and that was it. ""In 800m running, if there's no space, it probably means that you've put yourself in the wrong position and it's disappointing because I knew my potential was to win a medal and it's disappointing that I couldn't make that a reality."" Nijel Amos, London 2012 silver medallist and the fastest man in the world this year, briefly appeared to have been eliminated after falling in his semi-final. However the meeting referee judged that he had been impeded by American Isaiah Jewett, who also fell, and advanced the Botswanan to the final, expanding the field to nine athletes. Jazmin SawyersandAbigail Irozuruboth made the long jump finalduring the morning session.

New rules for fully jabbed US and EU arrivals begin,"This video can not be played There were hugs and tears at Heathrow as families reunited The first passengers have been arriving in the UK after rules changed to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantine. The change, which came in at 04:00 BST, affects those arriving from countries on the UK's amber list - except France. The UK government said the change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Airline bosses have welcomed the move but are calling for more countries to be added to the UK's green travel list. Thomas Walters, 47, was among some of the first arrivals from the US after flying from New York to London to surprise his father for his 70th birthday. He bought his plane ticket last Wednesday after realising the rules had changed and he could see his father for the first time since February 2020. ""All throughout the summer I've had a really strong longing to come back to the UK. Not being able to see each other for so long has been very difficult."" Thomas Walters said his father Julian was ""confused... then so happy"" after he arrived unexpectedly from the US Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure, and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Since 19 July, people who have been double-jabbed in the UK have not had to isolate when arriving from amber list countries, but all other travellers vaccinated elsewhere are required to quarantine for 10 days. Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals Tougher rules also remain in place for France,with travellers still required to quarantine even if they have been double jabbed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said this will be reviewed at the end of the week at the next review of the travel lists. Green country:When returning from a country on the green list you must take a Covid-19 test before departure and have proof of a negative result. You also need to book a test for day two after your return Amber country:A Covid test is needed three days before returning, and a PCR test two days after arriving. People who are not fully vaccinated in the approved countries need to self-isolate for 10 days, although this can be shortened for people in England by usingthe Test to Release scheme,external- paying for a test on day five Red country:Regardless of your vaccination status you must take a test before departure and, on arrival, self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel Read morehere. Elaine Burt (centre) greets her family after they land in Scotland Others to welcome the change included nurse Elaine Burt, 55, who met her sister and nephews at Glasgow Airport after they arrived from Boston in the US - their first meeting in 20 months. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible,"" she said. Her sister, Michelle Bolger, said it had been ""a rollercoaster trying to get here"", adding: ""I didn't I think I would see this day."" Naomi Hooper, who lives in San Diego, said she booked a flight back to the UK as soon as the rules changed so she could see her parents for the first time since December 2019. She said she was ""so grateful"" at getting the opportunity to come home. ""I probably won't want to leave in eight days but I'm hoping this is the beginning of the travel opportunity - for mum and dad to come and see the kids in America."" Naomi Hooper, who left her husband and children in the US, had a tearful reunion with her parents at Heathrow Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to get rid of the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test and replace it with a simpler, cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence."" The leaders of UK airlines described Monday's easing of the rules as a ""positive step"" but said they were concerned that the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Mr Shapps, they wrote that green status should ""increasingly become a default"" for countries, citing falling case numbers and the proportion of the UK population now vaccinated. As part of the changes, international cruise ships will beable to depart from Englandfrom Monday - after a 16-month pause. International cruises have been allowed from Northern Ireland since Saturday. Meanwhile, Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list of countries that holidaymakers would be warned could move to the red list at short notice. People coming to the UK from red list countries are required to isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel regardless of their vaccine status. The government already hasa green watch-list,,externalwhich features more than half the countries on the green list and signals they are at risk of moving to amber. Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the potential new travel category would ""be viewed as a massive red flag"" that would ""likely"" cause bookings to those countries to ""collapse"". But government minister Matt Warman defended the idea of travel watchlists, telling Sky News that warnings over potential quarantine changes gave people ""really important information when they're making significant financial decisions"". While US citizens will be able to avoid quarantine in the UK they are still being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency andthe US border is currently closed to many countries, including the UK, except to US citizens.

Team GB also made history in the pool, clinching themen's 4x100m medley relay silverfor their eighth swimming medal of the Games. Duncan Scott was part of a quartet including Adam Peaty, Luke Greenbank and James Guy who were pipped to the title by the USA. The 24-year-old, who signs off with a gold and three silvers, has now won more medals at a single Olympics than any other British competitor. In a dramatic BMX final, Worthington fell on her first run but landed a ground-breaking 360-degree backflip on her secondto score 97.50. Declan Brooks then took bronze in the men's event to claim GB's fourth BMX medal. British boxer Ben Whittaker alsoguaranteed himself at least a silver medalby beating Imam Khataev, of the Russian Olympic Committee, to reach Tuesday's 81kg final. Pat McCormack will also fight for gold in the men's welterweight division after Ireland's Aidan Walsh pulled out of their semi-final with an ankle injury, while Frazer Clarke reached the super-heavyweight final afterFrance's Mourad Aliev was disqualified. GB's sailing team haveguaranteed two more medalsto add to the bronze they have already won. John Gimson and Anna Burnet are second overall in the mixed Nacra 17 class with one race to go, while defending champion Giles Scott leads the men's Finn class and cannot now drop lower than third.

It was then a nervous wait for the the 28-year-old, but he had done enough todeliver his third career Olympic goldand second in the pommel horse. That, alongside two World Championship titles, makes him the all-time most successful gymnast in the event. He also becomes the seventh British competitor to win at least six Olympic medals, after Scott also achieved the feat in the pool earlier on Sunday. They pull level with Steve Redgrave and Charlotte Dujardin, while only Bradley Wiggins (eight) and Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny (both seven) have more. ""I feel absolutely lost for words, I can't even describe the feeling and I feel completely overwhelmed - it feels surreal,"" said Whitlock. ""Team GB have been doing absolutely incredibly. The gold medals have been flowing in and I just wanted to do the same thing. ""To come out here and get my own, I feel very proud."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Declan Brooks wins bronze medal in men's BMX freestyle final Worthington said she was trying to find a ""big banger trick"" to deliver Olympic gold but an unprecedented 360-degree backflip left her on the floor during run one. Undeterred, the 25-year-old went on to execute the move in her second run, becoming the first woman to land it in competition, and registering a score of 97.50. ""It was incredible,"" said Worthington, who watched on as four rivals - including hotly tipped American Hannah Roberts - failed to usurp her mark. ""I've not been doing that trick for so long but we've been trying to find that big banger trick and when we did we thought, 'this is the one'. If it wasn't for Hannah Roberts, we wouldn't be doing these tricks or be this far."" It was the culmination of years of hard work for Worthington, who was a late convert to BMX and had been working as a chef ""sweating it out in the kitchen for over 40 hours a week"" before concentrating on the sport. ""It's a lot of hard work paid off. On the bike, yes, it's physical hard work but I feel like the work on myself has paid off,"" she added. Having watched that drama unfold, Brooks added Britain's fourth BMX medal - after Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte in the racing - to cap an incredible Games. ""I've just cried for the last couple of minutes,"" 25-year-old Brooks told BBC Sport after his bronze was confirmed.

They may still be a distant third on the medal table to the USA and Australia, but an eighth trip to the podium marks the nation's most successful Olympics in the sport. The American team needed a world record time of three minutes 26.78 seconds to beat the British quartet to the men's 4x100m medley relay title. But a silver medal rounded off a superb Games in the pool for Britain, who finish with four swimming golds, three silvers and a bronze - having earned a solitary gold at Rio five years ago. It also capped a record-breaking Olympics for Scott, whose four medals are record haul for a Briton at a single Games and take him to six overall. ""I have a lot of good team-mates,"" Scott told BBC Sport. ""I'm very fortunate to be part of some excellent relay teams."" The US victory means American superstar Caeleb Dressel joins compatriots Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, as well as East Germany's Kristin Otto, as the only swimmers to win five golds at a single Olympics. Meanwhile,Australia's Emma McKeon made historyas the first female swimmer to win seven medals at an Olympics, claiming four golds and three bronze.

After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37m. They were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off, but in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title. Soon after, Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed ashock gold in the 100m finalto make it two Olympic athletics titles in quick succession for Italy.

Power plant's four cooling towers demolished,"This video can not be played The 300ft (90m) high structures were demolished as part of a plan to redevelop the site Four of eight huge cooling towers have been demolished at a former coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire. The 300ft (90m) high structures in Eggborough, near Selby, were brought down shortly after 08:00 BST as part of a plan to redevelop the site. It stood for 50 years in an area where all four Yorkshire counties - North, South, East and West - meet. The Yorkshire Day demolition was watched by spectators who were dotted in fields around the rural site. Police had closed roads and 40 security guards patrolled a 350m exclusion zone while contractor DSM carried out the work during drizzly conditions. Billy Young, a technical director at the company, thanked members of the community for their patience and said it had been ""a successful demolition"". ""We appreciate that a large number of Eggborough residents and businesses could have been disrupted by the work, but we have worked hard to communicate with them behind the scenes and by correspondence to minimise this in as much as practicably possible,"" he said. All eight towers each contained around 11,000 tonnes of reinforced concrete The 2,000-megawatt power station wasdecommissioned in 2018 because it was no longer financially viable. It started generating electricity in 1967 and produced enough to power the equivalent of Leeds and Sheffield combined. A year after its closure, the site was acquired by the St Francis Group, which is planning an industrial and distribution park on the site after the remaining structures are demolished, including a 200m (660ft) high chimney.

Grooming prosecutor: I couldn't defend a rapist,"The prosecutor of some of the UK's most notorious sex offenders has told of how he quit as a defence lawyer after not wanting to represent an alleged rapist. Nazir Afzal went on to become the chief crown prosecutor in the Rochdale grooming gang cases in 2012. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he had never celebrated a successful case as ""nobody should be harmed in the first place"". He said those guilty were mostly men who wanted to restrict women's choices. Mr Afzal started his career as a defence lawyer but told BBC presenter Lauren Laverne of the moment he realised he ""just couldn't do it"". He was advising a rape suspect before a police interview and had given his client a copy of the victim's statement. He could see the man was getting pleasure from ""re-hearing and rehearsing what he had done allegedly to that woman"", Mr Afzal explained. ""And his reaction to reading what she had said just was the icing on the cake in my mind. ""I couldn't say to him 'plead guilty' because he wasn't going to. He was going to drag her through the courtroom... and that's his right absolutely, but why should I be party to that? I wasn't going to be party to that. ""So I walked out the door, literally, and I handed my notice in almost immediately afterwards. I'm not doing this anymore. I can't do this. Good for people who can and we do need people who can do that, but it wasn't for me."" It's shameful that victims are suffering Three Girls drama depicts 'painful time' Grooming prosecutor faced death threats Mr Afzal joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1991 and went on to become director of prosecutions for London where he brought perpetrators of so-called honour-based violence to justice. In 2011, as chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, he began investigating sex grooming gangs in Rochdale, overturning a previous CPS decision not to bring charges against suspects. He brought prosecutions against nine men who were convicted andjailed in 2012 for the sexual exploitation of 47 young girls. BBC drama The Three Girls was based on the Rochdale abuse scandal Mr Afzal also prosecuted Stuart Hall, the former television presenter who in 2014 was convicted of multiple sex offences against children. In a wide-ranging interview, he told Lauren Laverne there was ""nobody more important in his life than the victims and survivors"" that he kept in touch with. He spoke of visiting one alleged victim of Hall whose case did not lead to a conviction. ""I went to see her and I said, 'I'm really sorry that I couldn't give you closure'. She looked me in the eyes and said, 'You gave me closure the moment that you believed me. My recovery started the moment you believed me.' ""That has never left me."" Choosing the track Women in Chains by Tears For Fears, he said: ""People can read whatever they want into it but for me it's the fact that women have been put in chains that we men - and it's men all the time sadly - that want to restrict the choices that women make.""

""I was beaten so often, on one occasion I was beaten by three guys who used my head as a football,"" he said. But his father did not call the police, instead telling the then 13-year-old: ""There's no justice. Nobody is prepared to listen to us."" He said: ""And so I was taken by what he wanted to do which was to provide a voice to those who were unheard, and in many respects that's how I built my career doing the same thing."" Mr Afzal retired from the Crown Prosecution Service in 2015. He currently chairs the Catholic Church's new safeguarding body and advises the Welsh government on issues of gender-based violence. He also told of how aged eight he cradled the body of his seven-year-old cousin Yasmin after she died of dehydration while travelling back from Pakistan. It was during the 30-day journey in a Transit van across Asia and Europe that Yasmin fell ill as they reached Germany, he said. ""We didn't know and my father was desperate for us to get home, he had his whole family in this van and she got so ill that a day or so later, just coming into Belgium she died. ""[She died of] dehydration, which these days, a couple of pills [would have helped], but you couldn't Google that back then could you?"" He added: ""We are going on a ferry to get back to England and my mother hands me my cousin and puts her in my arms and says look after her, she's sleeping. ""And I'm carrying her body without knowing that - across the channel and arriving in Dover until the authorities take her. ""I looked at her face, I stroked her hair. Lauren, nobody is going to die on my watch again, that's the way I felt and that's the way I've always felt.""

Power plant's four cooling towers demolishedThe coal-fired station at Eggborough stopped production in 2018 with the loss of 170 jobs.,"This video can not be played The 300ft (90m) high structures were demolished as part of a plan to redevelop the site Four of eight huge cooling towers have been demolished at a former coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire. The 300ft (90m) high structures in Eggborough, near Selby, were brought down shortly after 08:00 BST as part of a plan to redevelop the site. It stood for 50 years in an area where all four Yorkshire counties - North, South, East and West - meet. The Yorkshire Day demolition was watched by spectators who were dotted in fields around the rural site. Police had closed roads and 40 security guards patrolled a 350m exclusion zone while contractor DSM carried out the work during drizzly conditions. Billy Young, a technical director at the company, thanked members of the community for their patience and said it had been ""a successful demolition"". ""We appreciate that a large number of Eggborough residents and businesses could have been disrupted by the work, but we have worked hard to communicate with them behind the scenes and by correspondence to minimise this in as much as practicably possible,"" he said. All eight towers each contained around 11,000 tonnes of reinforced concrete The 2,000-megawatt power station wasdecommissioned in 2018 because it was no longer financially viable. It started generating electricity in 1967 and produced enough to power the equivalent of Leeds and Sheffield combined. A year after its closure, the site was acquired by the St Francis Group, which is planning an industrial and distribution park on the site after the remaining structures are demolished, including a 200m (660ft) high chimney.

Zoom settles US privacy lawsuit for $86m,"Video-conferencing firm Zoom has agreed to pay $86m (Â£61.9m) to settle a class action privacy lawsuit in the US. The lawsuit alleged that Zoom had invaded the privacy of millions of users by sharing personal data with Facebook, Google and LinkedIn. It also accused Zoom of misstating that it offers end-to-end encryption and for failing to prevent hackers from""zoombombing"" sessions. The firm denied any wrongdoing, but has agreed to boost its security practices. The preliminary settlement, which also includes a provision that Zoom will give its staff specialised training in data handling and privacy, is still subject to approval by US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. A Zoom spokesman said: ""The privacy and security of our users are top priorities for Zoom, and we take seriously the trust our users place in us. ""We are proud of the advancements we have made to our platform, and look forward to continuing to innovate with privacy and security at the forefront."" Zoom bets billions on home working continuing 'Zoombombing' targeted with new version of app Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars The class-action lawsuit,external, filed in March 2020 in the US District Court in the Northern District of California, is just one of several legal complaints facing the US-based video-conferencing platform. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Zoom Meetings paid subscribers nationwide, as well as free users. According to the plaintiff's lawyers, US Zoom subscribers generated $1.3bn in revenues for the video-conferencing firm. Should the proposed settlement be approved, subscribers included in the class action would be eligible for 15% refunds on their subscriptions or $25, whichever is larger, while others could receive up to $15. The plaintiffs' lawyers also intend to seek $21.3m in legal fees from Zoom. The video-conferencing firm had asked the courtto dismiss the motion,externalin March. However Judge Koh only granted the dismissal of part of the case pertaining to invasion of privacy and negligence - she allowed the plaintiffs to continue to pursue some claims relating to contracts. The video-conferencing firm has long been criticised for its approach to its security. One key issue that has led to some companies choosing to stop using the platform is the phenomena of ""Zoombombing"" incidents, where uninvited guests crash meetings to cause problems. According tothe New York Times,external, in April last year a virtual Chipotle event during the coronavirus lockdown was disrupted when a hacker entered and broadcast pornography to hundreds of attendees. Zoom has also come under fire for security flaws, including a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users and hijack shared screens. Another saw Mac users forced into calls without their knowledge. On top of this, plaintiffs of the lawsuit accused the platform of misrepresenting its encryption protocol - transport encryption - as end-to-end encryption. This means Zoom can access the video and audio of meetings, rather than the meeting's participants being the only ones able to decrypt communications. However, since April 2020, the BBC understands that Zoom has undertaken a substantial amount of work to address security and privacy concernsthrough app updates, includingthe introduction of end-to-end encryption,externaland more than 100 features related to privacy, safety and security.

Grooming prosecutor: I couldn't defend a rapistA top solicitor tells how he quit as a defence lawyer after refusing to represent an alleged rapist.,"The prosecutor of some of the UK's most notorious sex offenders has told of how he quit as a defence lawyer after not wanting to represent an alleged rapist. Nazir Afzal went on to become the chief crown prosecutor in the Rochdale grooming gang cases in 2012. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he had never celebrated a successful case as ""nobody should be harmed in the first place"". He said those guilty were mostly men who wanted to restrict women's choices. Mr Afzal started his career as a defence lawyer but told BBC presenter Lauren Laverne of the moment he realised he ""just couldn't do it"". He was advising a rape suspect before a police interview and had given his client a copy of the victim's statement. He could see the man was getting pleasure from ""re-hearing and rehearsing what he had done allegedly to that woman"", Mr Afzal explained. ""And his reaction to reading what she had said just was the icing on the cake in my mind. ""I couldn't say to him 'plead guilty' because he wasn't going to. He was going to drag her through the courtroom... and that's his right absolutely, but why should I be party to that? I wasn't going to be party to that. ""So I walked out the door, literally, and I handed my notice in almost immediately afterwards. I'm not doing this anymore. I can't do this. Good for people who can and we do need people who can do that, but it wasn't for me."" It's shameful that victims are suffering Three Girls drama depicts 'painful time' Grooming prosecutor faced death threats Mr Afzal joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1991 and went on to become director of prosecutions for London where he brought perpetrators of so-called honour-based violence to justice. In 2011, as chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, he began investigating sex grooming gangs in Rochdale, overturning a previous CPS decision not to bring charges against suspects. He brought prosecutions against nine men who were convicted andjailed in 2012 for the sexual exploitation of 47 young girls. BBC drama The Three Girls was based on the Rochdale abuse scandal Mr Afzal also prosecuted Stuart Hall, the former television presenter who in 2014 was convicted of multiple sex offences against children. In a wide-ranging interview, he told Lauren Laverne there was ""nobody more important in his life than the victims and survivors"" that he kept in touch with. He spoke of visiting one alleged victim of Hall whose case did not lead to a conviction. ""I went to see her and I said, 'I'm really sorry that I couldn't give you closure'. She looked me in the eyes and said, 'You gave me closure the moment that you believed me. My recovery started the moment you believed me.' ""That has never left me."" Choosing the track Women in Chains by Tears For Fears, he said: ""People can read whatever they want into it but for me it's the fact that women have been put in chains that we men - and it's men all the time sadly - that want to restrict the choices that women make.""

""I was beaten so often, on one occasion I was beaten by three guys who used my head as a football,"" he said. But his father did not call the police, instead telling the then 13-year-old: ""There's no justice. Nobody is prepared to listen to us."" He said: ""And so I was taken by what he wanted to do which was to provide a voice to those who were unheard, and in many respects that's how I built my career doing the same thing."" Mr Afzal retired from the Crown Prosecution Service in 2015. He currently chairs the Catholic Church's new safeguarding body and advises the Welsh government on issues of gender-based violence. He also told of how aged eight he cradled the body of his seven-year-old cousin Yasmin after she died of dehydration while travelling back from Pakistan. It was during the 30-day journey in a Transit van across Asia and Europe that Yasmin fell ill as they reached Germany, he said. ""We didn't know and my father was desperate for us to get home, he had his whole family in this van and she got so ill that a day or so later, just coming into Belgium she died. ""[She died of] dehydration, which these days, a couple of pills [would have helped], but you couldn't Google that back then could you?"" He added: ""We are going on a ferry to get back to England and my mother hands me my cousin and puts her in my arms and says look after her, she's sleeping. ""And I'm carrying her body without knowing that - across the channel and arriving in Dover until the authorities take her. ""I looked at her face, I stroked her hair. Lauren, nobody is going to die on my watch again, that's the way I felt and that's the way I've always felt.""

Mr Afzal started his career as a defence lawyer but told BBC presenter Lauren Laverne of the moment he realised he ""just couldn't do it"". He was advising a rape suspect before a police interview and had given his client a copy of the victim's statement. He could see the man was getting pleasure from ""re-hearing and rehearsing what he had done allegedly to that woman"", Mr Afzal explained. ""And his reaction to reading what she had said just was the icing on the cake in my mind. ""I couldn't say to him 'plead guilty' because he wasn't going to. He was going to drag her through the courtroom... and that's his right absolutely, but why should I be party to that? I wasn't going to be party to that. ""So I walked out the door, literally, and I handed my notice in almost immediately afterwards. I'm not doing this anymore. I can't do this. Good for people who can and we do need people who can do that, but it wasn't for me."" It's shameful that victims are suffering Three Girls drama depicts 'painful time' Grooming prosecutor faced death threats Mr Afzal joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1991 and went on to become director of prosecutions for London where he brought perpetrators of so-called honour-based violence to justice. In 2011, as chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, he began investigating sex grooming gangs in Rochdale, overturning a previous CPS decision not to bring charges against suspects. He brought prosecutions against nine men who were convicted andjailed in 2012 for the sexual exploitation of 47 young girls. BBC drama The Three Girls was based on the Rochdale abuse scandal Mr Afzal also prosecuted Stuart Hall, the former television presenter who in 2014 was convicted of multiple sex offences against children. In a wide-ranging interview, he told Lauren Laverne there was ""nobody more important in his life than the victims and survivors"" that he kept in touch with. He spoke of visiting one alleged victim of Hall whose case did not lead to a conviction. ""I went to see her and I said, 'I'm really sorry that I couldn't give you closure'. She looked me in the eyes and said, 'You gave me closure the moment that you believed me. My recovery started the moment you believed me.' ""That has never left me."" Choosing the track Women in Chains by Tears For Fears, he said: ""People can read whatever they want into it but for me it's the fact that women have been put in chains that we men - and it's men all the time sadly - that want to restrict the choices that women make."" Jump Around - House of Pain This Woman's Work - Kate Bush Why Should I Cry For You? - Sting One In Ten - UB40 Set You Free - N-Trance Woman in Chains - Tears For Fears One - U2 with Mary J Blige on vocals Talkin' Bout a Revolution - Tracy Chapman Mr Afzal said his quest for justice was in part shaped by the racist bullying he experienced as the child of Pakistani parents growing up in Birmingham. ""I was beaten so often, on one occasion I was beaten by three guys who used my head as a football,"" he said. But his father did not call the police, instead telling the then 13-year-old: ""There's no justice. Nobody is prepared to listen to us."" He said: ""And so I was taken by what he wanted to do which was to provide a voice to those who were unheard, and in many respects that's how I built my career doing the same thing."" Mr Afzal retired from the Crown Prosecution Service in 2015. He currently chairs the Catholic Church's new safeguarding body and advises the Welsh government on issues of gender-based violence. He also told of how aged eight he cradled the body of his seven-year-old cousin Yasmin after she died of dehydration while travelling back from Pakistan. It was during the 30-day journey in a Transit van across Asia and Europe that Yasmin fell ill as they reached Germany, he said. ""We didn't know and my father was desperate for us to get home, he had his whole family in this van and she got so ill that a day or so later, just coming into Belgium she died. ""[She died of] dehydration, which these days, a couple of pills [would have helped], but you couldn't Google that back then could you?"" He added: ""We are going on a ferry to get back to England and my mother hands me my cousin and puts her in my arms and says look after her, she's sleeping. ""And I'm carrying her body without knowing that - across the channel and arriving in Dover until the authorities take her. ""I looked at her face, I stroked her hair. Lauren, nobody is going to die on my watch again, that's the way I felt and that's the way I've always felt.""

Team GB also made history in the pool, clinching themen's 4x100m medley relay silverfor their eighth swimming medal of the Games. Duncan Scott was part of a quartet including Adam Peaty, Luke Greenbank and James Guy who were pipped to the title by the USA. The 24-year-old, who signs off with a gold and three silvers, has now won more medals at a single Olympics than any other British competitor. In a dramatic BMX final, Worthington fell on her first run but landed a ground-breaking 360-degree backflip on her secondto score 97.50. Declan Brooks then took bronze in the men's event to claim GB's fourth BMX medal. British boxer Ben Whittaker alsoguaranteed himself at least a silver medalby beating Imam Khataev, of the Russian Olympic Committee, to reach Tuesday's 81kg final. Pat McCormack will also fight for gold in the men's welterweight division after Ireland's Aidan Walsh pulled out of their semi-final with an ankle injury, while Frazer Clarke reached the super-heavyweight final afterFrance's Mourad Aliev was disqualified. GB's sailing team haveguaranteed two more medalsto add to the bronze they have already won. John Gimson and Anna Burnet are second overall in the mixed Nacra 17 class with one race to go, while defending champion Giles Scott leads the men's Finn class and cannot now drop lower than third. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table This video can not be played Whitlock wins pommel horse gold with 'excellent' routine Showing the confidence that makes him the world's best, Whitlock went out first and delivered a near-perfect routine that earned him a score of 15.583. It was then a nervous wait for the the 28-year-old, but he had done enough todeliver his third career Olympic goldand second in the pommel horse. That, alongside two World Championship titles, makes him the all-time most successful gymnast in the event. He also becomes the seventh British competitor to win at least six Olympic medals, after Scott also achieved the feat in the pool earlier on Sunday. They pull level with Steve Redgrave and Charlotte Dujardin, while only Bradley Wiggins (eight) and Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny (both seven) have more. ""I feel absolutely lost for words, I can't even describe the feeling and I feel completely overwhelmed - it feels surreal,"" said Whitlock. ""Team GB have been doing absolutely incredibly. The gold medals have been flowing in and I just wanted to do the same thing. ""To come out here and get my own, I feel very proud."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Declan Brooks wins bronze medal in men's BMX freestyle final Worthington said she was trying to find a ""big banger trick"" to deliver Olympic gold but an unprecedented 360-degree backflip left her on the floor during run one. Undeterred, the 25-year-old went on to execute the move in her second run, becoming the first woman to land it in competition, and registering a score of 97.50. ""It was incredible,"" said Worthington, who watched on as four rivals - including hotly tipped American Hannah Roberts - failed to usurp her mark. ""I've not been doing that trick for so long but we've been trying to find that big banger trick and when we did we thought, 'this is the one'. If it wasn't for Hannah Roberts, we wouldn't be doing these tricks or be this far."" It was the culmination of years of hard work for Worthington, who was a late convert to BMX and had been working as a chef ""sweating it out in the kitchen for over 40 hours a week"" before concentrating on the sport. ""It's a lot of hard work paid off. On the bike, yes, it's physical hard work but I feel like the work on myself has paid off,"" she added. Having watched that drama unfold, Brooks added Britain's fourth BMX medal - after Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte in the racing - to cap an incredible Games. ""I've just cried for the last couple of minutes,"" 25-year-old Brooks told BBC Sport after his bronze was confirmed. BMX centre 'so proud' of GB medallists This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Duncan Scott becomes GB's most decorated Olympian at a Games Regular visits to the podium at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre this Games have seen Britain establish themselves as one of swimming's powerhouses in Japan. They may still be a distant third on the medal table to the USA and Australia, but an eighth trip to the podium marks the nation's most successful Olympics in the sport. The American team needed a world record time of three minutes 26.78 seconds to beat the British quartet to the men's 4x100m medley relay title. But a silver medal rounded off a superb Games in the pool for Britain, who finish with four swimming golds, three silvers and a bronze - having earned a solitary gold at Rio five years ago. It also capped a record-breaking Olympics for Scott, whose four medals are record haul for a Briton at a single Games and take him to six overall. ""I have a lot of good team-mates,"" Scott told BBC Sport. ""I'm very fortunate to be part of some excellent relay teams."" The US victory means American superstar Caeleb Dressel joins compatriots Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, as well as East Germany's Kristin Otto, as the only swimmers to win five golds at a single Olympics. Meanwhile,Australia's Emma McKeon made historyas the first female swimmer to win seven medals at an Olympics, claiming four golds and three bronze.

It started in the men's high jump, which saw Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim and Italy's Gianmarco Tamberishare the gold medal. After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37m. They were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off, but in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title. Soon after, Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed ashock gold in the 100m finalto make it two Olympic athletics titles in quick succession for Italy.

Power plant's four towers demolishedThe coal-fired station at Eggborough stopped production in March 2018 with the loss of 170 jobs.,"This video can not be played The 300ft (90m) high structures were demolished as part of a plan to redevelop the site Four of eight huge cooling towers have been demolished at a former coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire. The 300ft (90m) high structures in Eggborough, near Selby, were brought down shortly after 08:00 BST as part of a plan to redevelop the site. It stood for 50 years in an area where all four Yorkshire counties - North, South, East and West - meet. The Yorkshire Day demolition was watched by spectators who were dotted in fields around the rural site. Police had closed roads and 40 security guards patrolled a 350m exclusion zone while contractor DSM carried out the work during drizzly conditions. Billy Young, a technical director at the company, thanked members of the community for their patience and said it had been ""a successful demolition"". ""We appreciate that a large number of Eggborough residents and businesses could have been disrupted by the work, but we have worked hard to communicate with them behind the scenes and by correspondence to minimise this in as much as practicably possible,"" he said. All eight towers each contained around 11,000 tonnes of reinforced concrete The 2,000-megawatt power station wasdecommissioned in 2018 because it was no longer financially viable. It started generating electricity in 1967 and produced enough to power the equivalent of Leeds and Sheffield combined. A year after its closure, the site was acquired by the St Francis Group, which is planning an industrial and distribution park on the site after the remaining structures are demolished, including a 200m (660ft) high chimney.

High jumpers agree to share Olympic gold,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Barshim and Tamberi share Olympic gold An incredible Olympic high jump final ended with both Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim and Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi taking gold medals. After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37 metres. The athletes were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off. But in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title, sparking huge celebrations. Both had three failures as they attempted to match the Olympic record of 2.39m and, with error-free records on countback, could have fought for sole possession of the title. Instead, they made history - it was the first joint Olympic podium in athletics since 1912. Mutaz Essa Barshim asked the Olympic official if they could have two gold medals, to which the steward nodded, saying, ""if you can agree to share it"" Gianmarco Tamberi suffered a leg injury just before the Rio 2016 Olympics, ruling him out of those Games. He kept the cast, writing 'Road to Tokyo 2020' on it, and had it with him as he won Olympic gold. Maksim Nedasekau of Belarus took bronze, having also jumped at 2.37m, but having more failed attempts across the competition. Tamberi and Barshim embraced before running to celebrate with their coaches and team-mates, hoisting their nation's flags above their heads. Barshim can add the gold medal to his back to back world titles, and is the winner of Qatar's second-ever Olympic gold medal, after weightlifter Fares Elbakh won the first on Saturday in the men's 96kg event. Tamberi was still celebrating on the track when his compatriot Lamont Marcell Jacobs ran into his arms, following hissurprise win in the men's 100m final. Both athletes have had to overcome tough injuries in their careers, but Barshim says the sacrifices were worth it. ""It is amazing. This is a dream I don't want to wake up from,"" he said. ""I have been through a lot. It's been five years that I have been waiting, with injuries and a lot of setbacks. But we are here today sharing this moment and all the sacrifices. It's really worth it now in this moment."" Tamberi had to take time out to recover from a career-threatening injury that ruled him out of Rio 2016. ""After my injuries, I just wanted to come back, but now I have this gold, it's incredible. I dreamed of this so many times,"" said the Italian. ""I was told in 2016 just before Rio there was a risk I wouldn't be able to compete any more. It's been a long journey.""

LiveLiveWatch Tokyo 2020: Italy's Jacobs wins shock 100m gold after Whitlock retains title2 minutes ago,"25 gold medal events on Sunday Gymnastics: Max Whitlock retains pommel horse title to win GB's 10th gold medal Athletics: Italy's Marcell Jacobs wins shock 100m gold after Zharnel Hughes false starts Tennis: German Alexander Zverev beats Russian Karen Khachanov in men's final 6-3 6-1 Swimming: Team GB win medley relay silver to clinch record eighth medal at one Games BMX freestyle: Charlotte Worthington wins Team GB's ninth gold with stunning second run Duncan Scott wins GB record fourth medal at same Olympics - one gold and three silvers in the pool BMX freestyle: Declan Brooks claims bronze in men's final Golf: Taiwanese CT Pan wins seven-way bronze play-off, USA's Xander Schauffele takes gold Boxing: Ben Whittaker advances to Tuesday's 81kg boxing final - guaranteeing at least a silver medal Boxing: Frazer Clarke in super-heavyweight semi-finals after French opponent disqualified Katie Falkingham and Ben Collins It was an astonishing night of athletics. First, we saw a world record broken as Venezuela's Yulimar Rojas won the women's triple jump. Her 15.67m final jump saw her smash the previous world record by a huge 17cm. That previous record was set by Ukraine's Inessa Kravets in 1995 - two months before Rojas was born. We then saw TWO gold medallists in the men's high jump, as Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi opted to share gold rather than take part in a jump-off. Both had three failures as they attempted to match the Olympic record of 2.39m and, with error-free records on countback, they could have fought for sole possession of the title. However, the friends decided to end the contest and split it. Then it was the one we'd been waiting all day for - the men's 100m final. Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed a shock gold after Britain's Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for a false start. Jacobs, who only switched away from long jump in 2018, streaked clear to win in 9.80 seconds, 0.04 clear of American Fred Kerley. Canada's Andre de Grasse won a second successive Olympic bronze in third. More gold was to come for Team GB on day nine. Enter Max Whitlock. The gymnast won double gold in Rio five years ago but chose to focus solely on the pommel horse in Tokyo, and it paid off. He was the first up in the event and immediately put the pressure on his rivals with a near-perfect routine that earned him a score of 15.583. Inwinning another Olympic titleand adding to his three world titles on the apparatus, he becomes the most successful gymnast EVER on the pommel horse. GB's Ben Whittaker will compete for Olympic gold after ""a masterclass"" win over Imam Khataevsaw him into the 81kg final. He lost the first round of his semi-final but boxed stylishly to beat Khataev, of the Russian Olympic Committee, by a split decision. Moments after Whittaker's success, super-heavyweight Frazer Clarke ensured he will win at least a bronze medal. Briton Clarke reached the semi-finals when Mourad Aliev was disqualified for repeated use of the head. And he kicked off big style. Upon being disqualified, the Frenchman kicked out at the floor and remonstrated with both Clarke and the officials in protest. The 26-year-old latersat on the ring apron and refused to leavethe arena for around 30 minutes. Wins for Whittaker and Clarke follow on from Great Britain's recent success in Tokyo, withPat McCormack also set for an Olympic final,whileKarriss Artingstall has secured bronze,and a number of other athletes remain in with a chance of a medal in their respective weight categories. Great Britain are therefore guaranteed to pass their haul of three boxing medals - won by Joe Joyce, Joshua Buatsi and Nicola Adams - from the 2016 Rio Olympics. It was quite the final day of the men's golf tournament. American Xander Schauffeleclinched the Olympic titlewith Slovakia's Rory Sabbatini taking silver, but all the drama was in the battle for bronze. There was a SEVEN-way play-off for the bronze medal, with CT Pan of Chinese Taipei finally claiming it on the fourth knockout hole. He pipped Open champion Collin Morikawa to bronze in a play-off that also included Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey, Japan's Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama, Chile's Mito Pereira and Colombian Sebastian Munoz. The first gold of the day for Team GB went to Charlotte Worthington, who won the women's BMX park freestyle Olympic final. The 25-year-old, who gave up work as a chef to focus on the sport in 2017, delivered an action-packed score of 97.50 to snatch gold on her second run. She'd fallen on her first run but recovered to become the first woman to land a 360-degree backflip in competition - the same trick that left her on the floor during run one. That set the stage for team-mate Declan Brooks to seal bronze in the men's event, Britain's fourth BMX medal of a remarkable week. ""It's definitely an exciting time for our sport,"" he said. Another day, another medal in the pool. Team GB's swimmers have well and truly smashed Tokyo 2020. Britain signed off theirmost successful Olympics in the poolwith Duncan Scott, Adam Peaty, Luke Greenbank and James Guy winning 4x100m medley relay silver - the eighth swimming medal of these Games. The silver was Scott's fourth medal in Tokyo, setting a new landmark for medals won by a Briton at a single Games. And with that, you've had your lot from us today. We'll leave you with the highlights of another cracking day in Tokyo. Don't you just love the Olympics? Men's 100m final Olympic 100m gold medallist Lamont Marcell Jacobs on BBC TV:""It is amazing, it is fantastic, it is a dream, Olympic champion in 100m I have no words. ""It is a gold medal, it is forever, I am very happy. Watching Gianmarco [Tamberi] was a massive boost, it is fantastic. ""My objective was to arrive in the final, was in the final, maximum concentration and run my line. It is fantastic for Italy, I think there is a big party like for the football."" Men's high jump Well this is lovely. Gianmarco Tamberi suffered a leg injury just before the Rio 2016 Olympics which ruled him out of the Games. He kept the cast, writing 'Road to Tokyo 2020' (and then 2021 when the Olympics were postponed) on it, and he had it with him as he won Olympic gold today. GB 1-3 India Allow Twitter content?

Or this may actually spur on some of these countries where we're seeing new talent come through to say 'hey, we can do this at this level!' There's nothing like succeeding at the Olympics to give you that hope and confidence.

Gold medal winner, with an Olympic record, and a world record...wow. It is a fantastic night,"" she said. âI was looking for it, I knew we had that distance in my legs to get it today. I was failing a bit in the technical aspect, but the last jump was one to give everything, and it was like that. ""I focused on giving my best, enjoying, and it came out. It makes me happy.

Team GB also made history in the pool, clinching themen's 4x100m medley relay silverfor their eighth swimming medal of the Games. Duncan Scott was part of a quartet including Adam Peaty, Luke Greenbank and James Guy who were pipped to the title by the USA. The 24-year-old, who signs off with a gold and three silvers, has now won more medals at a single Olympics than any other British competitor. In a dramatic BMX final, Worthington fell on her first run but landed a ground-breaking 360-degree backflip on her secondto score 97.50. Declan Brooks then took bronze in the men's event to claim GB's fourth BMX medal. British boxer Ben Whittaker alsoguaranteed himself at least a silver medalby beating Imam Khataev, of the Russian Olympic Committee, to reach Tuesday's 81kg final.

It was then a nervous wait for the the 28-year-old, but he had done enough todeliver his third career Olympic goldand second in the pommel horse. That, alongside two World Championship titles, makes him the all-time most successful gymnast in the event. He also becomes the seventh British competitor to win at least six Olympic medals, after Scott also achieved the feat in the pool earlier on Sunday. They pull level with Steve Redgrave and Charlotte Dujardin, while only Bradley Wiggins (eight) and Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny (both seven) have more. ""I feel absolutely lost for words, I can't even describe the feeling and I feel completely overwhelmed - it feels surreal,"" said Whitlock. ""Team GB have been doing absolutely incredibly. The gold medals have been flowing in and I just wanted to do the same thing. ""To come out here and get my own, I feel very proud."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Declan Brooks wins bronze medal in men's BMX freestyle final Worthington said she was trying to find a ""big banger trick"" to deliver Olympic gold but an unprecedented 360-degree backflip left her on the floor during run one. Undeterred, the 25-year-old went on to execute the move in her second run, becoming the first woman to land it in competition, and registering a score of 97.50. ""It was incredible,"" said Worthington, who watched on as four rivals - including hotly tipped American Hannah Roberts - failed to usurp her mark. ""I've not been doing that trick for so long but we've been trying to find that big banger trick and when we did we thought, 'this is the one'. If it wasn't for Hannah Roberts, we wouldn't be doing these tricks or be this far."" It was the culmination of years of hard work for Worthington, who was a late convert to BMX and had been working as a chef ""sweating it out in the kitchen for over 40 hours a week"" before concentrating on the sport. ""It's a lot of hard work paid off. On the bike, yes, it's physical hard work but I feel like the work on myself has paid off,"" she added. Having watched that drama unfold, Brooks added Britain's fourth BMX medal - after Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte in the racing - to cap an incredible Games. ""I've just cried for the last couple of minutes,"" 25-year-old Brooks told BBC Sport after his bronze was confirmed. BMX centre 'so proud' of GB medallists This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Duncan Scott becomes GB's most decorated Olympian at a Games Regular visits to the podium at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre this Games have seen Britain establish themselves as one of swimming's powerhouses in Japan. They may still be a distant third on the medal table to the USA and Australia, but an eighth trip to the podium marks the nation's most successful Olympics in the sport. The American team needed a world record time of three minutes 26.78 seconds to beat the British quartet to the men's 4x100m medley relay title. But a silver medal rounded off a superb Games in the pool for Britain, who finish with four swimming golds, three silvers and a bronze - having earned a solitary gold at Rio five years ago. It also capped a record-breaking Olympics for Scott, whose four medals are record haul for a Briton at a single Games and take him to six overall. ""I have a lot of good team-mates,"" Scott told BBC Sport. ""I'm very fortunate to be part of some excellent relay teams."" The US victory means American superstar Caeleb Dressel joins compatriots Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, as well as East Germany's Kristin Otto, as the only swimmers to win five golds at a single Olympics. Meanwhile,Australia's Emma McKeon made historyas the first female swimmer to win seven medals at an Olympics, claiming four golds and three bronze.

It started in the men's high jump, which saw Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim and Italy's Gianmarco Tamberishare the gold medal. After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37m. They were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off, but in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title. Soon after, Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed ashock gold in the 100m finalto make it two Olympic athletics titles in quick succession for Italy. Jacobs, who only switched away from long jump in 2018, streaked clear to win in 9.80 seconds, 0.04 clear of American Fred Kerley with Canada's Andre de Grasse taking bronze.

Italy's Jacobs wins shock 100m goldItaly's Lamont Marcell Jacobs claims an unexpected gold in the showpiece Olympic 100m final.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Italy's Jacobs wins 100m final while Hughes disqualified Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed a shock gold in the Olympic 100m final, after Great Britain's Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for a false start. Jacobs, who only switched away from long jump in 2018, streaked clear to win in 9.80 seconds, 0.04 clear of American Fred Kerley. Canada's Andre de Grasse won a second successive Olympic bronze in third. World champion Christian Coleman and Trayvon Bromell, the world's fastest in 2021, were both absent from the final. Coleman,banned for whereabouts failuresafter missing three drugs tests, and Bromell, eliminated in the semi-finals, were joined on the sidelines by the long-retired defending champion Usain Bolt. Few would have picked Jacobs, who was born in Texas to an American father but moved to his mother's Italian homeland before his first birthday, as the Jamaican great's successor. Jacobs only broke the 10-second barrier for the first time in May. But the European indoor 60m champion carried the momentum from his fast start all the way to the line to register a time faster than Bolt's winning mark in Rio. He was greeted by compatriot Gianmarco Tamberi, who had won a joint high-jump gold just minutes before and wrapped him in the Italian flag and an embrace. ""I don't know, it's a dream, a dream, it is fantastic,"" said Jacobs. ""Maybe tomorrow I can imagine what they are saying, but today it is incredible."" Second-placed Kerley admitted Jacobs was a new name to him. ""I really didn't know anything about him. It was my first time racing him at the Monaco Diamond League [where Jacobs finished third in 9.99 seconds],"" he said. ""He did a fantastic job."" Hughes will be left to wonder what might have been in a final stripped of its usual stars and big names. His clear false start brought back memories of defending champion Linford Christie's disqualification at Atlanta 1996 and denied him a shot of joining the most prestigious honour roll in athletics. Hughes, who made the same mistake at last month's British Championships, said it was the result of a sudden cramp in his calf. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Rojas sets new world record after becoming triple jump Olympic champion The 100m final was almost overshadowed by an undercard of superb field events. Venezuela'sYulimar Rojasadded Olympic gold to her world triple-jump titles, finally claiming the world record she has threatened all season. The 25-year-old already had victory wrapped up when she approached her final attempt, with no-one able to get close to her opening-round leap of 15.41m. Despite a sub-par step phase, she still soared out to 15.67m to beat the previous 15.50m world record set two months before her birth by Inessa Kravets of Ukraine. ""Wow. It is a fantastic night,"" said Rojas. ""I knew we had that distance in my legs to get it today. I was failing a bit in the technical aspect, but the last jump was one to give everything, and it was like that."" Portugal's Patricia Mamona took silver with a personal best 15.01m, but Colombian defending champion Caterine Ibarguen could only finish 10th. There was drama of a different kind in the men's high jump. Qatar's double world championMutaz Essa Barshimand Italy'sTamberiopted to share gold rather than take part in a jump-off. Both had three failures as they attempted to match the Olympic record of 2.39m and, with error-free records on countback, they could have fought for sole possession of the title. However,the friends,externaldecided to end the contest and split the title, sparking ecstatic celebrations from Tamberi who has competed with a plaster cast at the end of his run-up as a souvenir of an Achilles injury that ruled him out of Rio 2016 and almost ended his career. Daniel Rowden missed out on a spot in the 800m final by five thousandths of a second SistersTiffany PorterandCindy Semberwere unable to make Tuesday's 100m hurdles final for Great Britain. Puerto Rico's Jasmine Camacho-Quinn threw down the gauntlet to the rest of the field as she qualified in a new Olympic record of 12.26, just 0.06secs outside the world record of American rival Kendra Harrison, who also progressed. NeitherDaniel RowdenorElliot Gilescould make Wednesday's 800m final, with Rowden missing out on a fastest loser spot by just five thousandths of a second after getting boxed in around the final bend. ""I'm very disappointed,"" said Rowden. ""I went for a gap coming into the home straight and the gap closed as soon as I went through it, I lost my stride and that was it. ""In 800m running, if there's no space, it probably means that you've put yourself in the wrong position and it's disappointing because I knew my potential was to win a medal and it's disappointing that I couldn't make that a reality."" Nijel Amos, London 2012 silver medallist and the fastest man in the world this year, briefly appeared to have been eliminated after falling in his semi-final. However the meeting referee judged that he had been impeded by American Isaiah Jewett, who also fell, and advanced the Botswanan to the final, expanding the field to nine athletes. Jazmin SawyersandAbigail Irozuruboth made the long jump finalduring the morning session.

âLenders wonât touch us - my homeâs worth nothing'Campaigners say attempts to unlock the property market paralysed by the cladding crisis have stalled.,"Mortgage lenders ""wouldn't touch"" her flat under the current situation, says Emma Lee The government's latest attempts to unlock parts of the property market paralysed by the cladding crisis have stalled, according to campaign groups. An agreement between the High Street's biggest banks and the Ministry of Housing was supposed to pave the way for mortgages to be offered again on more than 800,000 flats in low and medium rise buildings that have been left unsellable after the Grenfell Tragedy in 2017. Last month, Housing Secretary Robert Jenricksaid buildings under 18 metres in height would no longer need an EWS1 fire safety form and should be presumed safe by lenders. But the BBC has learnt that banks are unlikely to change their policies until the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), which advises property valuers, updates its specialist guidance. Alex Dickin said many people remain stuck in a financially perilous situation. However, in turn RICS has said it can't alter its position on the issue until the government changes its official fire safety advice; that could take until November according to those familiar with the process. Alex Dickin, from campaign group Ipswich Cladiators, warns that many people remain stuck in a financially perilous situation. ""The government announcement has once again made no difference to the millions of leaseholders trapped in unsellable and mortgageable homes. We've yet to see any significant move from lenders,"" Mr Dickin, who's 28, told the BBC. This is a problem of the government's own making. Previously, EWS1 survey forms were only required on the tallest tower blocks. Ministers inadvertently expanded the scope of the cladding crisis in January 2020 whenthey said residential blocks of any height should be checked for fire risks. Mortgage lenders then began demanding fire surveys - known as EWS1 forms - from a much wider range of sellers. Latest government moves won't make a difference, says Emma Lee. Emma Lee's home, in south London, is one of an estimated 3.2 million flats that has been left unsellable as a result. The mother of two bought 50% of her one bed flat under shared ownership in 2008. Her block has four floors. A survey revealed problems with timber cladding and missing fire breaks; Ms Lee fears she will be left with a massive bill for work that may not be necessary. ""The genie is out of the bottle. What the government is now saying won't make any difference. No one wants to buy these flats with these problems, a lender won't touch us at the moment,"" said Ms Lee. Research by a group of independent experts, commissioned by the government, concluded last month that there was no systematic fire risk in buildings below 18 metres. The expert panel said that in most mid and low-rise blocks expensive repair work was unnecessary; instead the fire risk could be managed by installing alarm systems or sprinklers. Grenfell survivor warns lives are still in danger Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâ That brings little comfort to Ms Lee, who said 'extensive remediation works' are still planned for her block with residents facing 'devastating bills on the way and a real possibility of homelessness.' She believes she has become a victim of the zero-risk approach from lenders. For Jelena and Igor Solovjova the problem isn't the cladding on their building in Ipswich, but the insulation and plywood beneath it. When the couple tried to sell their property it was valued at nothing because it didn't have an ESW1 form. Jelena and Igor Solovjova have lost trust in the government Fixing the faults could run into tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Solovjova, 45, has multiple sclerosis and can only work part time. While his wife, Jelena, who is 35, is working three jobs to cover the increasing costs. ""This is stressful for us,"" she said. ""We are disappointed with the current situation. Our trust in government has been shaken, we are confused as to why the government compounds things by not achieving anything and doesn't appear to understand the crisis, our emotions are mixed."" The housing secretary told parliament last month that major lenders had agreed to swiftly change their rules; the Solovjovas are now hoping their building, which is under 18 metres, will now be reassessed. But while banks, including HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, have welcomed the announcement from the Mr Jenrick, the BBC understands it will not change their policies in the short term. UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said until RICS guidance and the government's official advice is updated ""lenders will continue to be guided by surveyors' expert opinions when a EWS1 form is required for medium and low-rise blocks of flats"". That's left leaseholders like Georgie Hulme, who lives on the third floor of a low-rise block in south Manchester, feeling angry and trapped. Inspections of her building after the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed problems including dangerous cladding. Georgie Hulme says it's a ""horrendous situation"" Ms Hulme doubts a change to fire safety guidance will make any difference to her and thousands of others who have already been dragged into this crisis. ""All these issues have now been flagged up, how can they all now just be ignored and buildings under 18 metres be deemed as safe?"" she said. ""If you wanted to sell, who would buy any of these flats? I can't see a huge demand. It is impossible to know between the government, manufacturers, developers, managing agents, who can be trusted in this horrendous situation?"" Ms Hulme, 42, who has disabilities and can't work, now fears bankruptcy. Her building is not eligible for any government funding to make it safe. ""For someone like myself who's disabled and on benefits, even if this means that technically I could borrow on the value of my property, the reality is not the case, as nobody would lend to someone in my situation,"" she told the BBC. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: ""We are committed to correcting the present market failure and supporting leaseholders to sell their properties should they wish to do so."" ""The view from the independent experts is that there is no evidence of a systemic risk of fire in blocks of flats, but excessive industry caution is leaving many leaseholders in lower risk buildings unable to sell, or facing bills for work which is often not necessary. ""This must stop and, in line with the expert advice, we've set out that EWS1 forms should not be requested for buildings below 18 metres.""

Who are the contenders for Bolt's 100m crown?,"This video can not be played USA's Bromell wins 100m at British GP Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. After more than a decade of dominance the era of Usain Bolt is over and someone other than the Jamaican great will be crowned men's 100m champion at the Tokyo Olympics. Bolt will go down as one of the greatest athletes of all time having stormed to 100m victory at the Beijing, London and Rio Games, adding three successive 200m golds for good measure. But the world record holder retired from athletics in 2017, finally giving someone else a chance of glory. With time having also caught up with 2004 gold medallist Justin Gatlin, and world champion Christian Coleman serving an 18-month anti-doping ban, this feels very much like the start of a new era in the Olympics' traditional blue riband event. The semi-finals take place on Sunday (starting at 11:15 BST) before the final at 13:50. Who is ready to write their name in the history books? Here are some of the contenders. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Trayvon Bromell won the men's 100m in 9.98 seconds at British Grand Prix Diamond League event in Gateshead this month Age: 26 Country:USA Personal best:9.77 Best time this year:9.77 Once considered a potential heir to Bolt's throne, Trayvon Bromell endured three injury-ravaged years that included tearing his achilles tendon during the 4x100m relay at Rio in 2016. However, the 26-year-old is back and heads to Tokyo as the fastest man in 2021, posting a time of 9.77 seconds in June. He went on to win the US trials in a similarly rapid 9.80. After leaving the track at the previous Olympics in a wheelchair, a coronation in Tokyo would feel like a moment of redemption. Fred Kerley won 400m bronze at the 2019 World Championships and says his long-term plan is to race at that distance Age: 26 Country:USA Personal best:9.86 Best time this year:9.86 A former US champion at 400m, Fred Kerley raised eyebrows when he chose to race at 100m and 200m, but showed he is more than capable over shorter distances by setting a personal best of 9.86 to come third in the 100m at the US Olympic trials. A personal best of 19.90 seconds in the 200m makes him only the third man to break the 10, 20 and 44-second barriers over 100m, 200m and 400m. A man of many talents, he cannot be discounted here. Ronnie Baker's only defeats this season have been in the semi-final and final of the US Olympic trials Age: 27 Country:USA Personal best:9.85 Best time this year:9.85 Ronnie Baker is another athlete who looks to have put his injury problems behind him. The 27-year-old's best year to date came in 2018 when he earned world indoor 60m bronze and set personal bests over that distance and 100m. Persistent injuries then hampered him throughout 2019 and he missed out on a place at the World Championships. However, he shaved 0.02 off his lifetime best when finishing second at this year's Olympic trials in 9.85 seconds - one of just two defeats this season, which has included Diamond League wins in Stockholm and Monaco. Andre de Grasse trains alongside fellow 100m contender Trayvon Bromell under coach Rana Reider Age: 26 Country:Canada Personal best:9.90 Best time this year:9.92 Andre de Grasse heads to Tokyo with an impressive track record. He won the 100m bronze, 200m silver and sprint relay bronze in Rio, following that up with bronze in the 100m and silver in 200m at the 2019 World Championships. Injury and illness have hampered his progress since then, although he ran a season's best 9.92 in Jacksonville in May. If he can win gold he would follow in the footsteps of Donavan Bailey, who won the 100m title for Canada at the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Simbine is bidding to become the first African Olympic 100m champion since 1908 Age: 27 Country:South Africa Personal best:9.84 Best time this year:9.84 Akani Simbine is aiming to become the first African to win the Olympic 100m title since South Africa's Reggie Walker at the 1908 London Games. He is another sprinter with decent pedigree, having finished fourth at the 2019 World Championships, and fifth at the 2017 Worlds and the 2016 Rio Olympics. He is also the reigning Commonwealth champion and has run sub-10 seconds in seven successive years. The 27-year-old set an African record of 9.84 seconds in Hungary in July, shaving 0.01 off the previous mark set in 2006. It also bettered the national record of 9.89 he had set at the same meeting five years ago. Age: 31 Country:Jamaica Personal best:9.69 Best time this year:9.98 Could the 100m gold stay in Jamaica? Yohan Blake has long been tipped as a potential successor to Bolt, with his personal best of 9.69 only bettered by his more celebrated compatriot. He won 100m gold at the 2011 World Championships and is a 2012 double Olympic silver medallist. However, he hasn't dipped below 9.90 seconds since those heady days and it is nine years since he won an individual major medal, with his season's best 9.98 in the Jamaican Championship semi-finals. The last British athlete to win the men's Olympic 100m was Linford Christie at Barcelona in 1992 Zharnel Hugheshas the fastest personal best of the three British contenders for the 100m - with his 9.91 in Jamaica in 2018 putting him second on the British all-time list alongside James Dasaolu and behind 1992 Olympic champion Linford Christie's 9.87. The 26-year-old is also the reigning European champion and reached the final at the 2019 World Championships. Reece Prescodtook silver behind Hughes at the 2018 European Championships. He won the British title in 2017 and 2018 and has a personal best of 9.94 seconds. CJ Ujahis the reigning British champion and in 2014 at the age of 19 became the youngest Briton to break the 10-second barrier, and just the fifth to do so, clocking 9.96 seconds, a time he matched in 2015. He failed to make the 100m final in Rio by just 0.01 seconds.

Team GB also made history in the pool, clinching themen's 4x100m medley relay silverfor their eighth swimming medal of the Games. Duncan Scott was part of a quartet including Adam Peaty, Luke Greenbank and James Guy who were pipped to the title by the USA. The 24-year-old, who signs off with a gold and three silvers, has now won more medals at a single Olympics than any other British competitor. In a dramatic BMX final, Worthington fell on her first run but landed a ground-breaking 360-degree backflip on her secondto score 97.50. Declan Brooks then took bronze in the men's event to claim GB's fourth BMX medal.

It was then a nervous wait for the the 28-year-old, but he had done enough todeliver his third career Olympic goldand second in the pommel horse. That, alongside two World Championship titles, makes him the all-time most successful gymnast in the event. He also becomes the seventh British competitor to win at least six Olympic medals, after Scott also achieved the feat in the pool earlier on Sunday. They pull level with Steve Redgrave and Charlotte Dujardin, while only Bradley Wiggins (eight) and Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny (both seven) have more. ""I feel absolutely lost for words, I can't even describe the feeling and I feel completely overwhelmed - it feels surreal,"" said Whitlock. ""Team GB have been doing absolutely incredibly. The gold medals have been flowing in and I just wanted to do the same thing. ""To come out here and get my own, I feel very proud."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Declan Brooks wins bronze medal in men's BMX freestyle final Worthington said she was trying to find a ""big banger trick"" to deliver Olympic gold but an unprecedented 360-degree backflip left her on the floor during run one. Undeterred, the 25-year-old went on to execute the move in her second run, becoming the first woman to land it in competition, and registering a score of 97.50. ""It was incredible,"" said Worthington, who watched on as four rivals - including hotly tipped American Hannah Roberts - failed to usurp her mark. ""I've not been doing that trick for so long but we've been trying to find that big banger trick and when we did we thought, 'this is the one'. If it wasn't for Hannah Roberts, we wouldn't be doing these tricks or be this far."" It was the culmination of years of hard work for Worthington, who was a late convert to BMX and had been working as a chef ""sweating it out in the kitchen for over 40 hours a week"" before concentrating on the sport. ""It's a lot of hard work paid off. On the bike, yes, it's physical hard work but I feel like the work on myself has paid off,"" she added. Having watched that drama unfold, Brooks added Britain's fourth BMX medal - after Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte in the racing - to cap an incredible Games. ""I've just cried for the last couple of minutes,"" 25-year-old Brooks told BBC Sport after his bronze was confirmed.

They may still be a distant third on the medal table to the USA and Australia, but an eighth trip to the podium marks the nation's most successful Olympics in the sport. The American team needed a world record time of three minutes 26.78 seconds to beat the British quartet to the men's 4x100m medley relay title. But a silver medal rounded off a superb Games in the pool for Britain, who finish with four swimming golds, three silvers and a bronze - having earned a solitary gold at Rio five years ago. It also capped a record-breaking Olympics for Scott, whose four medals are record haul for a Briton at a single Games and take him to six overall. ""I have a lot of good team-mates,"" Scott told BBC Sport. ""I'm very fortunate to be part of some excellent relay teams."" The US victory means American superstar Caeleb Dressel joins compatriots Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, as well as East Germany's Kristin Otto, as the only swimmers to win five golds at a single Olympics.

After an exhausting two-hour competition, the pair couldn't be split, having recorded best clearances of 2.37m. They were offered an opportunity to take part in a jump-off, but in a moment of sportsmanship, they agreed to share the title. Soon after, Lamont Marcell Jacobs claimed ashock gold in the 100m finalto make it two Olympic athletics titles in quick succession for Italy.

"Job cuts in some firms as furlough tapers - surveyFrom Sunday, government payments reduce to 60% towards salaries, with employers paying 20%.UK","One in five firms plan on letting staff go in response to Sunday's furlough policy change, which will see employers contribute more, a survey has found. The British Chamber of Commerce said extra training was needed to deal with thousands of redundancies predicted. From Sunday, government payments reduce to 60% towards salaries, with employers paying 20%. The government said the approach was ""right"" and meant ""we can focus support elsewhere"" as the economy recovers. According to the most recent figures up to 30 June, about 1.9m workers were on furlough, down from a peak of 5.1m in January. The government said 11.6 million jobs have been supported since the Job Retention Scheme launched in April 2020. The scheme is due to close at the end of September. How is furlough changing? Fewest people on furlough since pandemic began It meant that staff whose jobs were put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic were guaranteed 80% of their salaries - to a limit - from the government. As the scheme winds down, the support is slowly being made less generous. Since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. That amount has now risen to 20% during August and September. The British Chamber of Commerce surveyed 250 businesses, with 18% telling the chamber they were likely to make staff redundant in response to the change to furlough. A quarter said they would aim to reduce hours or move staff to part-time working patterns. Jane Gratton, head of people policy at the chamber, said the change ""will likely result in many thousands of people being released back into the labour market, as employers who are still struggling to recover from the recession are forced to make redundancies and cuts to working hours"". She said it was ""crucial"" that employers and the government give returning furloughed workers the support and training they need ""to be re-engaged and productive"". Hannah Slaughter, an economist from the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC that over the majority of the pandemic, the highest rates of furlough was among the under 25s, but the most recent data it was the over 60s who were more likely to be furloughed. ""That's concerning because we are likely to see a rise in unemployment when the Job Retention Scheme ends in the autumn and any workers who are left on furlough are more likely to become unemployed,"" she said. She said older people were more likely to leave the workforce when they lose their jobs and those who return in a new job were ""more likely to face a pay penalty"" relative to younger workers. The government said its employment programmes were working and had supported workers' livelihoods through the pandemic. ""We've always been clear that it's not possible to save every job, but our Plan for Jobs is helping people of all ages find the skills they need to get back into work,"" a spokesman said.

"Jab will not be compulsory for university lecturesMinisters are no longer considering making two doses mandatory for students in England, the BBC learns.","Ministers are no longer considering making it compulsory for university students to be fully vaccinated against Covid to attend lectures in England, the BBC has been told. The foreign secretary previously said students would get ""advance warning"" if they needed to be double jabbed. The government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues from September. More than 72% of UK adults have had two doses so far, while 88.5% have had one. How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The idea of making vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. And asked whether vaccination would be mandatory for students returning to halls of residence, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a decision would be taken in September. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. But now the idea of requiring students in England to show proof of vaccination to attend lectures or stay in halls of residence has been shelved, the BBC has been told. BBC political correspondent Peter Saull said he believed there were two key reasons why the government had rowed back on this. ""The first is logistics - how on earth could universities police this? And there were potentially some legal questions too because when you get an offer of a university place, that is considered to be legally binding,"" our correspondent said. ""But also I think ministers are keenly aware that unease is growing in the Conservative backbenches about this wider issue of vaccine passports."" The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education policy. Unions have been critical of making vaccines mandatory for university students. The University and College Union previously said this would be wrong and ""hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated"" as well as for international students. And the National Union of Students had called the idea ""appalling"", accusing the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. All over-18s in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a Covid vaccine - and people can get their second dose eight weeks later. This means the government expects all adults to have had the opportunity to have both jabs by the end of September. However, 32% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England had not had their first dose by 25 July, according to the latest data from NHS England. From the end of September, ministers have said people will need proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen but an NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. Meanwhile, a letter sent to GPs last week by NHS England said those who were three months away from turning 18 could get their first jab immediately. But families have criticised the guidance, which also warns doctors not to begin vaccinating some clinically vulnerable children against Covid-19 - because they may not be covered by insurance. Some GPs have said it has created mixed messages and confusion. The document said more information would be provided soon. Earlier this month, the government's vaccine advisers recommended offering the Pfizer jab to children in England, which includes about 150,000 12-15 year olds most at risk. In response, the NHS said there was ""no delay"" to vaccinating children in this age group and they would be offered a first dose before the start of the school year. It said the letter to GPs made clear a national indemnity contract will be set out shortly. Will my child get the vaccine? Elsewhere, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has warned companies that rules requiring staff to be fully vaccinated must not be disproportionate and discriminatory. The rights watchdog said it understood that firms will want to protect their staff and customers by requiring employees to be vaccinated but advised that they consider other factors. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously suggested it is a good idea for people to be double-jabbed before returning to the office, but legislation would not require it. Guidance from the CIPD,external, the trade body for human resources professionals, says that while employers do have a duty of care to employees they cannot force them to have the vaccine. A further 26,144 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and another 71 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to Saturday's government figures.
