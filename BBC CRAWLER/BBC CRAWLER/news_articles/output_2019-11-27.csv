SNP vote 'will send clear message on indyref2',"This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Nicola Sturgeon has launched the SNP election manifesto with a pledge to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". The manifesto says that the SNP winning the most seats in Scotland would send a ""clear"" message that an independence referendum must be held next year. Ms Sturgeon said the country faced a ""fundamental question"" over who should decide its future. And she called for a big increase in NHS funding across the UK. The SNP won 35 seats at the last general election in 2017, making it the third biggest party in the UK Parliament, and it hopes to hold the balance of power if there is a hung parliament after the forthcoming election. Ms Sturgeon says she is open to forming a ""progressive alliance"" with other parties after the election, but has ruled out doing a deal with the Conservatives or entering into a formal coalition with Labour. SNP manifesto: Key policies explained Read the full SNP manifesto,external Among the key pledges in the party's election manifesto are: A second referendum on Scottish independence next year Another referendum on EU membership, or the revocation of Article 50 if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit To call on the UK government to match Scottish per capita NHS spending, which will also deliver increased funding for Scotland Demand an end to austerity and press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy To call for the UK government to devolve powers over drug policy to the Scottish Parliament To press for the devolution of employment law To also seek the devolution of immigration powers so that Scotland can have a ""migration system that works for our economy and society"" Scrap the UK's Trident nuclear missile system An additional 12 weeks of parental leave which would be ring fenced for fathers to take A proposal for a NHS Protection Act to guarantee that the health service will not be used as a ""bargaining trip"" in future trade deals A plan to ring-fence oil and gas revenues to pay for climate change measures. At-a-glance: The SNP manifesto Ms Sturgeon accused the main Westminster parties of delivering ""constant chaos"" since the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scottish voters choose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. And she claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""dangerous and unfit for office"" and that his proposed Brexit deal would be a ""nightmare"" for Scotland. This video can not be played General election 2019: What's in the SNP's manifesto? She told the manifesto launch event in Glasgow: ""A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, It is a vote to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands, and it is a vote to deprive Boris Johnson's Conservative Party of a majority. ""The reality of Westminster control over Scotland is this: a right-wing Tory government Scotland didn't vote for and a prime minister in Boris Johnson who is dangerous and unfit for office."" Mr Johnson has alreadyruled out granting the formal consentthat Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says would be needed to ensure any independence referendum was legal. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would oppose a referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - but the party says it would not oppose one if there is a pro-independence majority after the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. But Ms Sturgeon said the decision on if and when a referendum is held should be one for the ""people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament"". She added: ""The democratically-elected Scottish Parliament has agreed the people should be given a choice over their future. An unelected Tory Westminster government has no right to overturn that decision. ""So an SNP victory in this election would be a clear instruction from the people of Scotland to respect Scottish democracy. ""There must be no Westminster veto over the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" Boris Johnson has given a ""cast iron guarantee"" that he would reject any request for consent to hold indyref2 if he wins the election And despite Mr Johnson's campaign pledge to ""get Brexit done"", Ms Sturgeon warned it was ""nowhere near done"" and predicted that Brexit would dominate Westminster politics for years to come. She said: ""The Tories have barely got going - they haven't even started trade talks. Because of Johnson's hard line position, there is every chance the UK will leave without a trade deal next year. That would be a catastrophe for jobs. ""And even if he somehow avoids that, his dream deal will be a nightmare for Scotland. ""It will take Scotland out of the single market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - and out of the Customs Union, the world's biggest trading block."" The SNP are not pretending that there is any chance they could form a government in Westminster, no matter how many seats they win. So Nicola Sturgeon admits these manifesto pledges can only be met if this election produces a hung parliament, if Labour are the largest party, if the SNP hold the balance of power, and if they can agree a deal with Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Sturgeon has already ruled out a formal coalition with Labour, saying she favours a ""progressive alliance"" with like-minded parties. In those circumstances the most important ask for Nicola Sturgeon is getting Mr Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum. Without that, any kind of deal would be unthinkable. Read more from Sarah here Ms Sturgeon also unveiled further details of the demands the SNP would make in return for supporting Labour if there is a hung parliament. The party says that central to this will be proposals to significantly increase funding for the NHS across the UK - with the SNP saying it is proposing more substantial funding increases than any other major party in the election. The SNP will demand that the next UK government raises per-head health spending south of the border to levels seen in Scotland. The party says spending is currently Â£136 per head higher north of the border, and that such a move would see NHS resource funding in England increase by more than Â£35bn between 2019/20 and 2023/24. This would also mean an additional Â£4bn in Barnett consequential for the Scottish NHS.

The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. Trident:The Conservatives say they will maintain the Trident nuclear deterrent. The Liberal Democrats support maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent with leader Jo Swinson making clear she would be prepared to deploy Trident if she was prime minister. Labour supports the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent but also said it would lead multilateral efforts to achieve a nuclear-free world under the non-proliferation treaty. Scottish independence:Labour opposes Scottish independence but has said a Labour-run UK government would agree to another referendum if pro-yes parties win a majority at the next Holyrood election in 2021. The Conservatives are opposed to a second independence referendum with Boris Johnson claiming he could ""guarantee"" there will not be a second vote if the Conservatives win the general election. The Liberal Democrats say they oppose a second independence referendum and oppose independence. Do you have any questions about the forthcoming election?

'I was put into care home for elderly at 46',"A year ago Nina Thair was living in her own home and working as a teacher at a secondary school in Brighton. She had overcome many challenges after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in her late 20s - 17 years ago. But she was still able to live independently with the help of walking aids. After a deterioration in her condition, all that changed. A lack of support in the community meant she had to be admitted to hospital. And from there, she was transferred to a care home for the elderly as she needed a wheelchair and could no longer cope with the stairs at her home. ""The care was fantastic - the system is full of people doing their absolute best in very challenging circumstances,"" Ms Thair says. ""But I should not have been there. I am a 46-year-old woman and I was in a bed that was meant for a dementia patient. ""There are just not the services available for working-age adults like me."" In the end, Ms Thair spent 10 months in the care home before being able to move into a specially adapted flat. While in the home, she had to sell her flat for much less than it was worth and she has now started paying the cost of her care. ""I have always worked full time despite my MS, saving and paying in to a mortgage,"" Ms Thair says. ""But I've had to take early retirement now. I always had a dream of going travelling and writing and blogging about my experience. ""But I've now realised that is not possible - all my money has to go on my care. Because of my disability, my money is not my own. It is massively unfair. ""I've probably gone through half of it [my money] in the past six weeks and in another six to eight weeks the rest will be gone. ""I am not saying I should not contribute - but everything I planned to do is gone. It breaks my heart. ""You see the same with elderly people who have saved all their lives and want to give their family an inheritance. People should be entitled to care if they need it. Politicians just do not understand it."" When Ms Thair's money does run out, she will be once again reliant on what local services can be provided. Currently, she has help from two carers but fears this may not continue in the long term. ""Soon I will not have any money,"" she says. ""I will be back at the sharp end of it fighting to get the care I need."" Where in England does care cost the most? It is a fight that is becoming increasingly difficult. There are more than one million adults reliant on social care provided by councils. A survey of nearly all directors of social care across England indicates 94% have little or no confidence they will be able to meet their statutory responsibilities next year, with 90% saying they have concerns they have insufficient capacity to cope this winter. Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) president Julie Ogley said it was clear the situation was ""getting worse"". And the problems accessing care were causing people to end up in hospital, go without care or rely on friends and family. ""Good care and support transforms lives,"" she added. ADASS said the system was ""desperately short of funding"" but has also called for wider changes. During the election campaign, all three main parties in England - social care is devolved - have promised to act. The Tories and Lib Dems want to see a cross-party approach adopted to come up with new proposals. And the Tories have made an explicit commitment no-one should have to sell their own home to pay for care. Labour, meanwhile, has called for free personal care to be introduced for those who need help washing or dressing. It has said this would be targeted at older people first, before being rolled out to working-age adults. Councils warned of 'exhausting' reserve cash What's happened to social care?

Man stabbed to death while on phone to his mum,"Paul Smith was on the phone to his mother when he was targeted A mother was on the phone to her son when he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him to death with a pair of scissors, a court has heard. IT analyst Paul Smith, 28, was attacked by George McAdam near Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh in May. A court heard McAdam had only been freed from prison two weeks earlier. Prosecutors accepted his not guilty plea on the basis he ""lacked criminal responsibility"" at the time of the attack due to a mental disorder. McAdam was formally acquitted at the High Court in Glasgow. The court heard Mr Smith had been returning to work at Edinburgh University when he wasattacked by McAdamand stabbed 32 times. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said: ""He was still chatting to his mother by telephone. ""She then describes hearing 'a horrific scream'. She heard her son saying: 'Help me... need police, need police."" Margaret immediately yelled to her husband Ian to dial 999. But Mr Smith did not survive the attack, which happened close to Edinburgh Castle. Police sealed off the scene in Johnston Terrace after the attack in May The court heard McAdam, 40, initially fled the scene but was rugby tackled by a passer-by in a nearby car park. McAdam, who had faced a murder charge, will remain at the State Hospital at Carstairs. The court heard he had been sleeping rough in Edinburgh at the time. McAdam had a lengthy list of convictions in Scotland and England, including for possession of a knife and assault. He had been freed from HMP Edinburgh on 15 May, just over a fortnight before the fatal attack. Mr Smith, of Balerno, was attacked at about 13:45 on 30 May, after visiting a KFC restaurant for lunch. Paul Smith was returning to his work in Edinburgh at the time of the attack Prosecutor, Ms Edwards told the court: ""His mum immediately told her husband to call police as their son needed help. ""She stayed on the phone to her son."" The court heard McAdam had grabbed Mr Smith, who tried to defend himself. Ms Edwards said: ""McAdam repeatedly stabbed him in the chest area. ""Paul Smith shouted 'he's stabbed me' and fell to the ground."" McAdam then dragged Mr Smith down a steep embankment while continuing the attack. The court heard he knelt beside his victim and struck him multiple times on the body and neck. Members of the public heard Mr Smith's cries for help but the court was told McAdam appeared ""oblivious"" to a crowd that was gathering. McAdam eventually ran off but was tracked to a nearby NCP car park. Police and paramedics spent more than 30 minutes trying to save Mr Smith, but Ms Edwards added: ""His injuries would not have been survivable even with medical intervention."" The court heard McAdam was later seen by psychiatrists and was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Lord Turnbull ordered him to remain at Carstairs on an interim compulsion order. The case will call again in February.

Vue boss hoping to rescreen banned film,"This video can not be played Vue chief executive Tim Richards says the chain is looking at ""beefing up security"" to bring the film back The boss of a cinema chain that banned a London gang film after a mass brawl in Birmingham has told the BBC he plans to resume screenings by the weekend. Vue banned Blue Story after saying there had been 25 serious incidents in 16 of its cinemas. But its chief executive, Tim Richards, said it was now looking at ""beefing up security"" to restart screenings. It comes after Blue Story's director, Rapman, questioned whether there were ""hidden reasons"" for the ban. Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film ban 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Cinema chains pull gang film after 'machete' brawl Rapman, whose real name is Andrew Onwubolu, previously told the BBC there was ""no connection"" between his movie and the brawl in Birmingham, which led to five arrests. ""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? ""Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing?"" This video can not be played Rapman says he feels cheated following Vue's decision Vue has said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race. Responding to Rapman, Mr Richards said the chain wanted ""more movies like this on our screens, not less"". ""Right now we are looking at trying to get that movie back onto our screens by the weekend and possibly, if we can, to accelerate that,"" he said. ""Our plans right now are to look at the timings and look at who's buying the tickets, and we're going to be beefing up security where we've had problems. ""There will be one or two cinemas, like Birmingham, where it will be very difficult to justify screening it again there."" Rapman (centre) on the set of Blue Story Blue Story focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes on rival sides of a street war. It is rated 15 for strong language, strong violence, threat, sex and drug misuse. Another cinema chain, Showcase, had also initially stopped showing the film after the incident in Birmingham, butreinstated screenings on Monday nightafter ""careful consideration and discussions with the distributor"". In a statement, Vue added: ""Following an ongoing review of security to protect the safety of our staff and customers, we hope to be showing the film from this weekend with additional security arrangements in our cinemas to ensure everyone can enjoy the film in comfort and safety."" Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, welcomed Vue's decision and expressed gratitude to ""everyone who fought for this movie like it was their own"". Allow Twitter content?

Dunn family begin Foreign Office legal proceedings,"Harry Dunn died after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton in August The family of Harry Dunn have begun their legal proceeding against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Mr Dunn, 19, died in a crash in Northamptonshire in August which led to the suspect, Anne Sacoolas, leaving for the USA under diplomatic immunity. His parents have filed a claim for judicial review in the High Court in London against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Family spokesman Radd Seiger said the FCO was ""wrong in law"". He said: ""The parents have done everything physically within their power to avoid having to sue the FCO. ""There have been repeated public and private attempts on our part to engage with those in authority to resolve this dispute amicably."" Harry Dunn's parents Charlotte Charles (left) and Tim Dunn (right), pictured with Radd Seiger (centre), said they were concerned Mr Raab had been ""pressured by the US"" Mr Seiger said the family's legal team has advised them ""the FCO's interpretation of the diplomatic immunity laws and treaty is absurd in practice and wrong in law"". The FCO said last monththe family had not found ""any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge"". It said an allegation that Mr Raab had misused or abused his power was ""entirely without foundation"". Raab heckled as Dunn family left out of hustings Dunn's family 'disgusted' with Raab over costs Bikers take to the road in memory of Harry Dunn The family said that a letter sent to them from the foreign secretary confirmed that the FCO would ""seek full costs"" for the legal challenge. Mr Raab had previously said this was to ""protect taxpayers' money"". The family said the cost of the case could be ""upwards of Â£50,000"". Dominic Raab was heckled by friends and family of Harry Dunn outside constituency hustings on Monday A spokesman for the FCO said: ""We have deep sympathy for Harry's family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. ""As the foreign secretary set out in Parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. On Monday, Harry Dunn's father Tim Dunn attempted to speak to Mr Rabb at his constituency hustings in Surrey. A member of staff at the church where the hustings were held said he was kept outside due to fire safety.

"Boy, 14, 'killed by rival gang in frenzied attack'","Jaden Moodie was stabbed to death in London on 8 January A 14-year-old boy was knocked off a moped and then stabbed to death by a rival gang in a ""violent and frenzied"" attack, a court has heard. Jaden Moodie was allegedly dealing drugs for a gang when he was targeted by a group of five men on 8 January. Ayoub Majdouline was in a stolen Mercedes which was driven at Jaden, causing him to be ""catapulted"" over the bonnet, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Majdouline, 19 and of London, denies murder and possession of a knife. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told jurors the five men in the car had armed themselves with knives and had gone to ""great lengths"" to hide their faces. ""On finding Jaden Moodie, the Mercedes drove straight towards the moped, swerving onto the same side of the road so that it struck Jaden Moodie head on,"" he said. The 14-year-old was allegedly dealing drugs for a gang when he was targeted by a group of five men He told the court the victim ""did not stand a chance"" and his crash helmet had come off when he was struck. Three men then got out of the car and ""repeatedly"" stabbed the 14-year-old in a ""violent and frenzied attack"", as he lay ""defenceless and seriously injured"" on the ground, the court was told. ""Fourteen seconds was all it took,"" Mr Glasgow added. Jaden was found with nine stab wounds and bled to death in the road, the jury heard. Members of the victim's family gasped and cried out as CCTV footage of the attack was played to the jury. The prosecutor said the images showed the killers had ""no qualms about playing out their petty rivalries using the blade of a knife"". The Mercedes was abandoned in a quiet cul-de-sac, while a knife and a pair of yellow rubber gloves were thrown away and recovered from a nearby drain the next day, the court was told. Mr Glasgow said the 14-year-old's blood and traces of the defendant's DNA were found on both. Burnt clothing belonging to Jaden's attackers was also found in a churchyard, the court was told. Mr Majdouline disputes playing any part in the attack. The trial continues.

As it happened: SNP launch and claims over NHS,"Nicola Sturgeon launches SNP election manifesto She accuses Boris Johnson of being ""dangerous and unfit for office"" Jeremy Corbyn produces documents he says prove the NHS is ""on the table"" is trade talks with the US In a BBC interview earlier, he conceded those on lower incomes could pay more tax under Labour Boris Johnson apologises for Islamophobia in the Conservative Party Former Tory grandee Lord Heseltine campaigns with the Lib Dems and attacks the Tories' ""get Brexit done"" message The country goes to the polls on 12 December Paul Gribben and Alice Evans We are at the end of another busy day of the general election campaign. Here is a
recap of Wednesdayâs main events:   The Metro leads on the YouGov poll which claims the Conservatives will win a majority of 68 seats in the general election The Times says Mr Johnson is on course for a comfortable majority as a result of making gains at Labour's expense - based on the YouGov poll The FT reports a warning from the Resolution Foundation - that a new Conservative or Labour government would be likely to break its budgetary rules. The Guardian leads on the story we've been bringing you reaction to all day - a dossier released by the Labour Party which, it claims, is ""proof"" the Tories want to ""sell"" the NHS in a US-UK trade deal. Although different in style, the Mirror's front page isn't too different from the Guardian's in sentiment Refraining from a focus on the YouGov poll, the Telegraph's main story is Dominic Cummings' warning that the election is too close to call YouGov said it had interviewed around 100,000 people over the last seven days to research its MRP model. If the election were tomorrow it says the Lib Dems would win 13 constituencies (one more than they had before Parliament was dissolved), the SNP would win 43 (a gain of eight), while Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would remain static with four seats and one seat respectively. The YouGov model is seen as important by political observers because their last predictions called the hung
parliament and got 93% of seats correct. While this is impressive, thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether or not the 2017 result was a one-off
     success. The Conservatives will win the general election with a majority of 68 seats, according to a YouGov poll. Were the election held tomorrow, YouGov
projects the Tories would win 359 seats - 42 more than they took in 2017. Labour is on track to lose 51 MPs by securing 211 seats, the poll suggests. The poll suggests that the Conservatives would pick up seats from the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and the North. YouGov's MRP model was hotly anticipated because it is the method that first accurately projected a
hung parliament in 2017. Remember, there are caveats to this and any prediction should be treated with caution. The difference between this model and ordinary polling is that it applies national trends to constituencies, using demographics and previous results. This means it's more specific than national polling but will miss any truly local issues. And like other polls, the data can change between now and the
election. Expelled Conservative politician Lord Heseltine speaks to reporters at a Liberal Democrats press conference in central London Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP supporters at her party's manifesto launch in Glasgow An NHS worker poses with a dossier on US-UK trade talks. The papers were handed out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's event in London Big party policies were put to one side for a few minutes when Boris Johnson enjoyed a scone on a tour of Rodda""s Clotted Cream in Redruth, Cornwall Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons. They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected. Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos. The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month. Read our full story here. Some people on Twitter have
been speculating that a blog published earlier by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs
closest political adviser, had breached the civil service code and that he has since quit his role. Pre-election restrictions apply tomore than 440,000 civil servants working in the UK,external- staff who are politically impartial and work for government departments or agencies. In this period, they aren't allowed to do any work for ""political party purposes"". In Mr Cummings's 2,200-word posting, he says he has never been a member of a political party - but urges everyone who voted for the UK to leave the EU to support the Conservative Party in the next election. He also warns readers of a ""Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance"" in the event that the Tories fail to win a majority. However, the BBC has
confirmed with the Cabinet Office that he resigned as a special adviser at the start of the
campaign - along with all the other special advisers - as a formality. Stepping down at that point meant he would be able to campaign without breaking any rules. A Labour Party member in Plymouth has been criticised for sharing images of a postal vote on social media. Baz Ahmed tweeted a picture he was sent of a postal vote for Labour election candidate Luke Pollard, that revealed the voter's name and ballot paper number. The tweet has since been deleted. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport candidate Mr Pollardsaid on Twitter,externalhe advised his team and others ""not to share"" such pictures. Critics on social media said the move may have broken data protection and electoral laws. Read our full story here. What has happened so far today? Here is a mid-evening catch-up on the main events from today on the campaign trail. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Moving away from the topic of the NHS, Andrew Neil asks Justice Secretary Robert Buckland about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson has said anyone guilty of Islamophobia in his party would be ""out first bounce"". But Mr Neil accused Mr Buckland and his colleagues of allowing people to ""bounce back in"" again. Mr Buckland says: ""The record shows that we have been taking swift and immediate action to remove and suspend people who clearly have crossed that line into unacceptable, innapropriate and offensive comments."" But the BBC presenter challenges him, citing a recent example where a local councillor was thrown out of the party for Islamophobic comments made online - before being allowed back in again at a later date.  The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. Critics have said this does not go far enough, and that a review dealing solely with Islamophobia is what is needed. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Back to the question of what ""on the table"" actually means... The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Labour says the documents released earlier prove that this isn't the case. Mr Buckland says the six meetings were ""discussions of a preliminary nature"" about drug prices in a future US-UK trade deal. But he adds: ""That does not mean this is a negotiation based upon specific requirements. It's the sort of scoping discussion that happens in every free trade agreement. There's nothing unusual about this at all."" Andrew Neil pushes the Tory frontbencher, though, saying: ""There is nothing in these documents to say drug prices are not on the table."" Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Now it's the turn of Justice Secretary Robert Buckland in the hot seat. Presenter Andrew Neil begins by quoting International Trade Secretary Liz Truss when he spoke to her last week - she said the price the NHS pays for drugs was not on the table in US-UK trade talks. ""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today. Whissendine farmer Anthony Watchorn, who was running as an independent candidate, has died aged 69 after being taken to hospital yesterday. He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Younger peoplewere much less likely to votein the last two general elections compared to older people. So unsurprisingly, most voter registration adverts on Facebook were targeted at this under-35 age group. Read more here. Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

Five things we learned from leaked trade papers,"Labour says leaked government documents show that the NHS would be at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claim was ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of formal talks. The 451-page document, leaked from the Department for International Trade,contains a record of discussions that have taken place between UK and US officials over a possible future trade deal. Here are five things we've learned from the document. US trade negotiators had already set outthat they wanted ""full market access"" for US drugs,externalas part of a future UK/US trade deal after Brexit. The leaked document does reiterateconcern in the US over drug prices. One of the trade representatives is quoted as saying: ""there is a lot of conversation on drug prices and looking at what other countries pay and this is causing angst"". A big part of the document, however, focuses on patents. Pharmaceutical companies can obtain patents which grant exclusive rights to sell and market drugs for 20 years in their country of origin. While the patent exists, other companies cannot manufacture cheaper copies of the drug - often called generics - in the same country. This applies in most countries around the world, but different countries have their own rules within that. There are already a lot of similarities between the patent system in the US and the UK, including on the length of patents. The leaked document compares the two systems in place for extending patents when they are delayed from entering the market. The US negotiators also suggest some other technical changes to the UK's patent regime, which could affect the relationship with European patent regimes. One of the main reasons for cheaper drug prices in the UK is the negotiating power of the NHS, as the near monopoly purchaser in the UK, whether the drugs are patented or generic. Jeremy Corbyn presented the leaked documents at a Labour Party press conference At the meeting on 10 July 2018, under the heading ""key points to note"", the document states: ""The US are very concerned at the contents of the Chequers statement."" This refers to the first draft of Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal with the European Union (EU) earlier that month. It proposeda ""common rulebook"" on goods with the EU. The document reveals that the US trade representatives were left ""deflated"" at the UK's plan to stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health. They saw this as a ""worst-case scenario"" for a UK-US trade deal. The Chequers agreement led to several ministerial resignations - including then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. His revised deal does not include any reference to a ""common rulebook"". In November 2017, the US told UK officials that it considered its food safety system to be ""the gold standard"", but acknowledged that its approach is different to the EU's. For example, while the EU is trying to reduce the amount of chemicals in food, the US continues to use them, including chlorine, as ""a final double check to remove any traces of pathogens"" - ie disease-causing viruses or bacteria. Chicken is often treated with a chlorine wash in the US to kill pathogens One US official suggested that the UK should not stick with the EU's food regulatory standards after Brexit. Instead, the US ""recommended that the UK maintains regulatory autonomy"". The same official suggested that the UK had used chemical washes to treat food in the past ""and wondered if there would be an interest in bringing them back post-EU Exit"". The document says the US would ""share their public lines on chlorine-washed chicken to help inform the media narrative around the issue"". How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? In the document from the November 2017 meeting, the US talked about its concerns over some food labelling. The US side said it was ""concerned that labelling food with high sugar content (as has been done with tobacco) is not particularly useful in changing consumer behaviour"". This goes against the UK's current public health strategy,which includes raising awareness of food labels through campaigns like Change4Life in England and Walesand Eat Better Feel Better in Scotland. In 2013, the UK government launched a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme, encouraging manufacturers to indicate the nutritional content of products, for example whether they are high in sugar or fat, using a traffic light scheme. The issue of climate change was raised at the meeting of the UK-US Trade and Investment Working Group, on 13-14 November 2017. A UK representative ""inquired about the possibility of including reference to climate change in a future UK-US trade agreement"". A US representative ""responded emphatically that climate change is the most political (sensitive) question for the US, stating it is a 'lightning rod issue'"". They went on to explain that they were bound by Congress not to include mention of greenhouse gas emission reductions in trade agreements. They stated this ban would not be lifted anytime soon. The UK has signed up to the Paris agreement on climate change and has set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The US, under President Trump, has said it intends to withdraw from the treaty. What is in the Paris climate agreement? The Department for International Trade said it would not comment on the leaked documents. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today.

He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

Welsh Assembly grants vote to 16 and 17-year-olds,"The bill will give 16-year-olds the vote at the next Senedd election Sixteen and 17-year-olds will be able to take part in the 2021 Welsh Assembly election under a new law passed on Wednesday. The legislation gives 70,000 teenagers the vote and also gives voting rights to 33,000 foreign nationals. A total of 41 assembly members voted for the bill, just exceeding the two-thirds majority of 40 votes needed. The assembly will be renamed Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament as part of the changes. Labour, Welsh Government ministers and Plaid Cymru backed the bill, but the Conservatives and the Brexit Party opposed it. The decision was backed with the help of Presiding Officer Elin Jones and deputy presiding officer Ann Jones, who do not normally take part in Senedd votes. AMs back new bilingual name Tensions over Welsh Assembly name change Assembly's name should change, say AMs Ms Jones said the law would ""empower young people to participate in the democratic process"". ""This bill, in my view, will create a more inclusive, diverse and effective Senedd,"" she added. But the inclusion of votes for foreign nationals following Welsh Government amendments earlier in the process upset the Conservatives, despite some having backed votes for 16-year-olds. Former Tory group leader Andrew RT Davies called it a ""stitch-up"" by the ""left-wing political establishment"". That was rejected by the presiding officer, who said it had all been done by ""democratic process"". Voting changes come into effect at the next assembly election, while the name will change in May 2020. L-R: Geraint Williams, Lara Evans, Tabitha Anthony Tabitha Anthony, 18, from Tondu, said she did not think 16-year-olds ""would be mature enough to do their own research"". The A-level student who is planning to vote Tory said: ""I've heard in our common room lots of people discussing politics, but they're trying to describe and explain the different policies to each other when really you're just hearing the propaganda that's being spread."" Lara Evans, 19, from Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, said she ""100%"" would have voted at 16: ""I think 16 is a completely responsible age to give people the vote."" ""Young people are definitely more engaged in politics,"" Geraint Williams, 19, from Cardiff, said. The musical theatre student, who is undecided but leaning towards Labour, added: ""We're realising that it's our future and we are the future generation and that we have the opportunity to make the final decision."" As well as 16 and 17-year-olds, the Senedd and Elections Bill will allow foreign nationals resident in Wales to vote in assembly elections - beyond those EU and Commonwealth citizens who can already take part. David Melding, Conservative AM, said the new name was an ""appropriate recognition"" of the assembly's powers, but the foreign national measures had been added without consultation in a way that was ""quite insulting frankly to those with genuine concerns with lack of scrutiny"". ""This novel idea is not common practice anywhere else, as far I'm aware,"" he said. He claimed the bill, which was introduced by theAssembly Commission,externalbut has been significantly amended, had been ""hijacked by the Welsh Government"". Assembly members will become known as Members of the Senedd Scotland gave 16-year-olds the vote in 2013for the 2014 independence referendum. Ms Jones said the move was ""long over due"" in Wales. But Brexit Party AM Mark Reckless said by voting for the bill, ""the partiality and bias"" of the presiding officer ""has been demonstrated"". ""This time it will have a serious impact on the constitutional arrangements of Wales,"" he warned. Ms Jones said assembly rules allowed ""for the presiding officers - for the Llywydd - me, to vote where a super majority is required and that was required today in the passing of today's constitutional bill"". The bill's passage follows a row about what the assembly should be called. There have been callsstretching back to 2012for the assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament, in recognition of its growing role in making law. Plaid Cymru and others, including in Labour, wanted the Welsh-only Senedd. A majority of AMs in the end agreed to call the institution Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament, with the support of the Welsh Government, but AMs will be called Members of the Senedd in future. Welsh Government minister Jeremy Miles told the chamber ministers will use the term Senedd to refer to the assembly. ""We have won by default,"" Plaid's Rhun ap Iorwerth said. While disappointed with the name, he said the legislation was an ""important milestone"". He said the law ""formally notes the assembly's flowering into a national parliament for our country"". The name Senedd, he said, would have shown ""we are confident in our heritage, united in our future, and that we celebrate what makes us unique as a country"". The bill includes measures to stop councillors from also being AMs and disqualify registered sex offenders from joining the Senedd.

Jeremy Corbyn interview fact-checked,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced the BBC's Andrew Neil in the second of a series of special interviews with party leaders in the run-up to the election. During the half-hour interview, he answered questions on his party's policies and record. BBC Reality Check has looked at three of his claims. Reality Check:The Labour leader was challenged over this claim by Andrew Neil, who raised Labour's plans to scrap the marriage allowance. Mr Neil said ""almost two million of them are going to lose Â£250 and they earn a lot less than Â£80,000"". Everyone has a personal allowance, which is an amount they are allowed to earn before they start paying income tax - this year it is Â£12,500. Marriage allowance is fora couple who are married or in a civil partnership.,externalIf one partner has an income below Â£12,500, they can transfer 10% of their personal allowance to the other one, as long as they are a basic rate taxpayer. To be a basic rate taxpayer, they would have to be earning between Â£12,500 and Â£50,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and between Â£12,500 and Â£43,430 in Scotland. That would reduce the couple's tax bill by a maximum of Â£250 a year. Transferrable marriage allowance was introduced under David Cameron and started from April 2015. HMRC says that 1,780,000 people claimed the relief in 2018-19,externalat a cost of Â£485m. (If you're wondering why that's an average of more than Â£250 each, it's because you are allowed to claim for previous years back to 2015-16.) Labour plans to remove the transferrable marriage allowance for equality reasons. This will only raise a relatively small amount of money in the scale of government spending, but would nonetheless mean that some people earning less than Â£80,000 a per year will pay more income tax. Mr Corbyn responded that the people who lost the Â£250 relief would receive other benefits under Labour including a living wage, improved free nursery provision and properly-funded schools. But none of those policies would directly affect their income tax rates or reliefs. Reality Check:Mr Neil gave another example: someone on a state pension - worth Â£8,767 - with an annuity of Â£4,000 and a dividend income of Â£2,000. That's their share of the profits of whatever companies in which their pension fund is invested. He said that Labour's plans to tax dividends at the same rate as income tax (20% in this case) could leave some people, with a total income of less than Â£15,000 paying about Â£400 more in income tax. Mr Corbyn disputed the figures. Under Labour's tax changes they could pay Â£400 more but it depends where the dividends are coming from. If they came from a stocks and shares ISA, for example, they would be tax-free (you can currently save up to Â£20,000 a year). Reality Check:Mr Corbyn didn't give a timeframe here for his statement that ""tax rates in general have gone down"". If you look back to the 1970s, for example, the top rate of income tax then was 83% for those earning more than Â£140,000 (in today's money). Income tax rates are the same today as they were in 1990-91 for both the basic rate taxpayer (20%) and the higher rate (40%). But things are a little more complicated, since there used to be a ""lower"" or ""starting"" rate, and since 2010-2011 there has been an ""additional"" rate for those earning more than Â£150,000. That additional rate did indeed drop from 50% to 45% in 2013-14. And those rates don't tell us anything about tax allowances or relief and National Insurance, which have changed over time. When it comes to worsening inequality, Mr Corbyn didn't specify exactly what he meant by this. If you look at income inequality, for example, then Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that it has remained relatively stable since 2010 - the year the Conservatives first came to power. The ONS measures income inequality using something called the Gini coefficient. In this case, a coefficient of zero would mean that all households had the same income while 100 would mean that one household had all the income. The data,externalsuggests that there was a considerable increase in income inequality in the 1980s, but it has very gradually declined over the past decade. Income inequality was 32.5% last year, very slightly down from the 32.7% recorded just before the 2010 election. But this measure only looks at income, not wealth and assets. However, wealth inequality is much harder to measure because a lot of rich people do not disclose what their true wealth is. When it comes to other areas of inequality, the data is more clear cut. For example, the ONS said last year that there been a statistically significant increase in the difference in life expectancy in England between the richest and poorest. How do you measure inequality? Has life expectancy fallen in Britain? What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

What are the key policies in the SNP manifesto?,"The SNP has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan ""Stronger for Scotland"". It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce. Thefull document runs to 52 pages,external. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day,12 December? Keep Scotland in the EU by supporting a second Brexit referendum with Remain on the ballot paper. About a third of Scotland's million Leave voters at the Brexit referendum in 2016 were also supporters of Scottish independence. However, Nicola Sturgeon has come down firmly in favour of the UK remaining within the EU, or re-joining it if Scotland becomes independent. At Westminster, the party's MPs have backed moves towards another Brexit referendum, so long as Remain is an option on the ballot paper. That continues to be the position in the current election's manifesto. If it comes to a choice for MPs between revoking Brexit and ""no deal"" with the European Union, the SNP says it would back revocation. In addition, Brexit is seen by the SNP as such a big change to the UK constitution that it warrants another vote on Scottish independence, or indyref2 as it has been dubbed. Even if Brexit is thrown into reverse the SNP will still use any leverage it has after this election to secure indyref2, arguing that the Brexit ""chaos"" will continue for years. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Ask the UK government to give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum next year on independence. Precisely nobody will be surprised to see support for an independence referendum in the SNP manifesto. To be clear, the party already believes it has several mandates for a new poll, but hopes that a big win on 12 December will really cement its case. This is because the big question about indyref2 is how it comes about. Nicola Sturgeon wants an agreement with the UK government before holding a vote, but has seen theConservatives rule this out completely,externalandLabour say it wouldn't be on the table in the ""early years"" of a new government.,external If Ms Sturgeon is to get a referendum on her 2020 timetable, something needs to give - and she wants the result of this election to send a big message to both potential prime ministers about ""Scotland's future being in Scotland's hands"". The constitution is reserved to Westminster. Can Nicola Sturgeon deliver Scottish independence? Demand that the UK government raise health spending in the UK to match health spending in Scotland. Health is a devolved issue meaning spending and policy are decisions for the Scottish government. The SNP has been in power in Scotland for a more than decade andhas been under scrutiny over its domestic record. But that doesn't stop the SNP wanting to influence what happens at Westminster. Scotland spends more per head on health than any other part of the UK. This is partly to support rural services, but historically Scotland has faced a number of public health challenges. The SNP says to get its support in the event of a hung parliament, spending on the NHS across the UK needs to increase by billions of pounds. Pushing up spending per head in the UK to the same level as Scotland would then give a further boost to the block grant from the Treasury to Holyrood. That would mean health spending in Scotland would remain proportionally higher than the rest of the UK. Health is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy. The SNP could not form a majority government, so there's no costed budget with this manifesto. That will be for the Holyrood elections in May 2021. So there are demands for additional spending, without making clear the source of these funds. The big ask of the next chancellor is to reverse the spending squeeze over the past decade. There's a claim in the manifesto that deficit reduction measures by the Treasury have led to Â£13.9bn less spending on public services in Scotland (between 2010-2011 and 2019-2020) than would otherwise have been the case. While the Conservatives plan to increase the level at which employees start to pay National Insurance, the SNP wants both to freeze that level and to devolve power over that system, so that it can be integrated with Holyrood's income tax powers. The other big tax-and-spend change would be to take the Â£8.5bn in tax revenue projected (by the Office for Budget Responsibility) over five years from UK offshore oil and gas, and to apply it to a ""net zero fund"", to help the transition of energy use. That is a change from past SNP spending plans, which looked to oil and gas revenue to fund public services. Most taxes are decided by Westminster, including National Insurance. Get rid of the UK's nuclear deterrent and spend the money on public services. The SNP has long called for the removal of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines from Scottish waters. Nicola Sturgeonhas recently stated it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government. Jeremy Corbyn, too, has long been an opponent of nuclear weapons, but official Labour Party policy(restated in its manifesto),external- like that of the Conservatives - is to support the renewal of Trident. The Liberal Democrats say they'd keep Trident but reduce the nuclear posture of round-the-clock patrols with three instead of four submarines. The trouble is that the Westminster Parliament has already given the green light to build four new submarines to carry the Trident missiles at a cost of Â£35bn. That work is already well under way. The SNP still believes scrapping Trident would free up tens of billions of pounds to strengthen conventional forces and to spend on hospitals and schools. But critics of the SNP position warn that scrapping Trident would hit the local economy on the Clyde where the submarines are based. They also argue it could jeopardise Britain's position as a recognised nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council. Defence is a reserved power of Westminster. Introduce a bill to protect the health service from privatisation and future trade deals. The future of the NHS - and its part in any post-Brexit trade deals - has already been a major battleground in this election. Although the Scottish government is responsible for running the health service in Scotland, there have been concerns that after Brexit, trade negotiations between the UK and US could lead to American companies bidding for contracts and pushing up the cost of drugs. The SNP's NHS Protection Act would enshrine in law that the NHS is protected as publicly-owned and operated with its services publicly commissioned. The SNP says it will stop the health service becoming a lever in any kind of international trade deal. Crucially the legislation says any trade deal would require the consent of all the devolved parliaments and assemblies to ensure it did not impact on the health service. However, the Conservatives have strongly denied the NHS would ever be used as a bargaining tool. Expect to hear more about it during the campaign. Trade is a reserved power, however the government has pledged to involve devolved powers in talks. Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Sturgeon announces plans for NHS protection bill CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external Devolve drug classification powers to Holyrood. Scotland has a drugs death crisis. There is an escalating number of drug deaths in Scotland - in 2018 a record total of 1,187. Thedeath rate in Scotland is the worst in the EUand three times higher than the UK as a whole. The SNP has voiced frustration that some radical solutions cannot be explored. At present, drugs policy is reserved to Westminster under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. The SNP manifesto wants the power to allow a consumption room in Glasgow where users could inject or smoke their own illegal drugs. But this has been put on holdbecause the Home Office refused permissionfor Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, to grant legal protection for it. The SNP argues the proposal would connect hard-to-reach users with drug treatment services and help cut the death toll among older addicts. It's a high-profile pledge but they acknowledge it's just one part of an issue that will require long-term action. Drugs policy is reserved to Westminster, whilst public health is devolved. Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts Demand the UK government matches Holyrood's climate change targets. While some parties have been throwing around new dates for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, the SNP has not. But then the ink is barely dry onScottish legislation which set 2045 as the new target year. Instead it commits its MPs to push the new UK government into helping Scotland achieve that target through accelerating the deployment of carbon capture, usage and storage -  a key technology for tackling the climate crisis - and matching Scotland's 2032 date for all new cars to be electric. It also wants taxation reformed to support ""greener choices"", like making our homes more energy-efficient. But the SNP insists Brexit must not be allowed to derail the train carrying us towards net-zero. And - unsurprisingly - suggests that the key to going even further in addressing climate change is... independence. Some energy policy is reserved, however Scotland has a number of powers for reducing climate emissions. Pass power over immigration to the Scottish Parliament so Scotland can have a migration system that works for its economy and society. Scotland faces more acute problems from demographic change than the rest of the UK. As the workforce is projected to shrink and the older population rises, it has had a slower inflow of migrants from overseas than England. There is a political consensus on the need to tackle the issue, with a more welcoming attitude to immigrants. Social attitude surveys, however, do not find such a big difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK. With the end of free movement of EU citizens, Brexit raises special challenges to several sectors of the economy, including the NHS, social care, construction and agriculture. Issues with a disproportionate presence in Scotland include food processing, tourism and universities. The SNP wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. It wants to cut the cost for employers of recruiting from overseas, and to simplify the visa and citizenship process. The party also says there should be a more welcoming approach to asylum seekers. If Scotland became independent and were then to re-join the European Union, it is accepted that membership would require the free movement of EU citizens, potentially leading to issues over the border between Scotland and England. Immigration is reserved to Westminster. Up the provision of paid leave for parents and encourage dads to take more time off. All the parties are making some kind of offer to new parents. The SNP's goes further than most. Nicola Sturgeon says its offer would be a ""game changer""- a new 12-week use-it-or-lose-it period of ""daddy leave"". Parents are currently entitled to convert up to 50 weeks of their 52-week maternity leave to shared parental leavebut take-up by dads has been ""stubbornly low"". The SNP is offering to extend this to 64 weeks with 12 weeks ring-fenced for fathers to encourage them to take the time off with their new babies. In addition it is offering to increase statutory pay and introduce stronger protections against redundancy for new parents. How the SNP could introduce this is open to question. Parental leave is covered by employment law and this is decided by Westminster, not Holyrood, so the SNP would need to win the support of other parties or introduce a private members' bill to deliver this proposal. Parental leave is reserved to Westminster. To find out more read oursimple guide to the SNP Give the Scottish Parliament control of employment law and more benefits. The SNP wants powers over employment rights to be devolved to Holyrood. With or without them, it wants the statutory living wage (which is Â£8.21 for those aged 25 and over) to go up to the ""real living wage"" - calculated on the basis of what workers need - by increasing it by Â£1.09 per hour on this year's figures. There is also a call for better protection for those on insecure work contracts. On welfare, the Scottish government is gathering newly devolved powers at Holyrood, pushing up the budget with a transfer of around Â£3bn next year. This is being used to soften the system applied by Whitehall, although the complexity of devolving powers is proving problematic, and some changes have been delayed from 2021 to 2024. On those powers still held at Westminster, the SNP wants to see a halt to the roll-out of universal credit. It is pushing for the reversal of some controversial measures on benefit entitlement introduced in recent years, including the freeze on working-age benefits. Most benefits, including pensions and Universal Credit, and workers' rights are reserved to Westminster. Give Holyrood power over train services to build better, greener public transport. Can shifting power from Westminster to Holyrood help deliver cleaner, greener public transport? The SNP thinks so. It says rail passengers would get a better deal if the Scottish Parliament controls both track and train - that is, the train operator, Scotrail, and Network Rail, which maintains the lines, signalling and many stations. Right now, Network Rail is ultimately controlled by Westminster. The SNP wants that to change. Why? Bitter experience shows passengers get fed up with delays caused by repair and upgrading works - and often blame Scotrail, regardless of whether it is its fault. Closer working between track engineers and train operators, the SNP argues, would make planning easier - and reduce disruption for commuters. The SNP has rejected Labour's railway nationalisation plans. A single, GB-wide company would, it says, strip powers away from Scotland. But it has left open the option of a public sector operator running Scotrail services in the future. It has made this case before, but political horse-trading after this election could give it the breakthrough it wants. Most rail policy is reserved to Westminster.

NHS news under wraps until after the election,"There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"" It prevents civil servants from making any form of statement during general election campaigns which might be construed as political or likely to influence public debate. The principle is to ensure that their impartiality is not called into question. As usual, that applies to the health service.NHS England put out guidance,externalto local health leaders in early November. It includes a reminder that ""democratic debate between candidates and parties should not be overshadowed by public controversy originating from NHS bodies themselves"". Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000? Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? Is the NHS the best health service possible? Because health is a devolved issue and there are no elections for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, there are no purdah rules affecting the NHS there.  Northern Ireland follows similar guidelines to England. The purdah policy has led to certain policy papers and publications being delayed till after the election. This includes an annual review of maternity care by independent experts for NHS England (known as the MBRRACE report). The charity Birthrights said the report was vitally important to learn lessons on preventing future maternal deaths. But Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, said: ""Actually, the findings of this report were presented to clinicians earlier this month to ensure that any lessons are learned. Rules on NHS political impartiality are unchanged and have always applied to all public bodies at election time."" Purdah has in practice meant that, with only a tiny number of exceptions, no health leader or member of clinical staff in England has given any interview or made any public comment since the start of the campaign. That might not seem unreasonable, but when thelatest performance figures(covering September and October) were published by NHS England in mid-November, the absence of health service reaction was painfully obvious. Performance across the key targets, which were missed yet again, was the worst since modern records began. Politicians used the air time to trade blows on what or who was to blame but there was no analysis from staff and management in the NHS. Media access to hospitals was not possible. NHS sources indicated that individuals were free to speak, though not on behalf of their NHS employers or trusts. Voters in England can at least use those recent figures to scrutinise the performance of their local hospital trust against key targets for cancer care, A&E waiting times and waits for routine surgery. But they might well want to know how, both locally and nationally, the NHS has been faring as winter has begun to set in during November. The next opportunity would have been on Thursday 12 December, when the next set of official NHS England statistics were due. It was also the day when the more detailed weekly winter updates were set to begin. But 12 December is polling day - and those two data publications have now been postponed until the 13th. At the time of the last general election, the guidance from the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) was that""statistical bulletins of significant public interest"" should not be published on national polling days,external. But it was permissible for these statistics to be brought forward 24 hours or postponed till the day after polling day. Perceiving some confusion over how this should be interpreted, the UKSA then consulted on whether the policy should be clarified and last year published new guidelines requiring a ""blanket approach"". Henceforth, all official statistics pre- announced for a date which was then designated as polling day should be delayed until the next day. Waiting times at A&E are one of the key NHS targets The BBC's code of practice ensuring fairness between candidates requires no campaign coverage on polling day, including subjects which have been at issue in preceding weeks and other controversial matters. The broadcast regulator Ofcom states thatthere should be no ""discussion and analysis of election issues"",externalwhile polling stations are open. This would imply no coverage of NHS performance figures after a campaign when health has been a hotly debated topic. But just because the broadcasters have to steer clear of contentious issues while the UK goes to the polls, does the public have to be barred access to official statistics? If there are updated performance figures available for the NHS at a time of great stress in the service why should voters not have the right to look at them and reach their own conclusions? The Times newspaper has reported thatmore than two dozen marginal constituencies have A&E departments which are amongst the worst performing in England,external. Perhaps the public in those seats might like to check the latest situation on December 12th rather than waiting till after the polls have closed. The UKSA itself is not holding back because of purdah and has let it be known it will challenge contentious claims made by politicians and in manifestos. It has already intervened over statements made on education in England and youth unemployment in Scotland. The UKSA has shown itself to be open-minded and prepared to review guidelines. Around 25 sets of official statistics have been postponed from polling day. There may be a case for revisiting the issue after this campaign. The need to avoid controversy and political debate on polling day has to be set against the public's right to know. That is indeed a tricky balancing act. How well does the NHS spend its money? Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000?

The big names facing a nervy election night,"(l-r) Gavin Barwell, Esther McVey and Nick Clegg have lost their seats in past general elections. Esther McVey regained her seat in 2017. No matter how many opinion polls you run ahead of a general election, you can never know the result until those ballot papers are counted. And it is candidates in the marginal seats who will be facing the biggest pressure on polling night. Perhaps even more stress will be piled on the big names who don't want to hit the headlines for losing their place in the Commons. ThinkTory stalwart and cabinet minister Michael Portillo in 1997, orshadow chancellor and Labour loyalist Ed Balls in 2015. No-one wants a ""moment"" named after them, but which big guns are facing possible defeat on 12 December? Where are the seats that could turn the election? Find your constituency and candidates Who should I vote for? Election policy guide The traditional definition of a marginal seat is a constituency where the sitting MP won by a margin of 10% or less at the last election. Using this logic, there are 169 marginal seats across the UK, but in the increasingly volatile world of British politics even those with a bigger cushion are sometimes far from safe. Boris Johnson giving his victory speech after winning Uxbridge in 2015 Boris Johnsonwon the seat of Uxbridge and Ruislip South in West London by a majority of just 10.8% of the vote in the 2017 general election. Compare this to the last majorities of former PMs - 50.2% for Gordon Brown, 45.5% for Theresa May, 44.5% for Tony Blair and 43% for David Cameron - and you can see why this could lead to the biggest upset of the night. There was a 13% swing to Labour in Uxbridge in 2017 and the opposition parties - including Labour campaign group Momentum - are pushing hard to unseat the PM. The opposition dream result goes like this: it's the morning after polling day and Boris Johnson isn't even an MP. Activists trying to oust him claim their supporters have turned out in their hundreds to help. They hope young and ethnic minority voters in Uxbridge could tip the balance. Is there more to this than hope? One recent estimate based on nationwide data suggested that while some of his high-profile colleagues could struggle, Boris Johnson would see an increased majority. Another, similar estimate is due shortly. But stress that word ""estimate"". Most in the business of forecasting the political future are cautious these days. If he did lose his seat, and the Conservatives win the general election, what then? There is a precedent for a prime minister who is neither a member of the House of Commons or House of Lords. In a soon-to-be-published blog Robert Hazell from University College London points out that Conservative Alec Douglas-Home continued as PM between giving up his seat as a Lord and winning a by-election. Should Boris Johnson lose he could - Prof Hazell suggests - persuade a colleague in a safe seat to quit, prompt a by-election of his own and have another go. Even his opponents' dream result might not spell the end of the prime minister's political career. Here's afull list of the 12 candidates vying for the Uxbridge seat. Quite a number of Mr Johnson's Cabinet are also heading for a close contest. Zac Goldsmithhas the biggest battle on his hands. The candidate for Richmond Park in West London - and a minister at the Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs - won his seat by just 45 votes in 2017 (or a 0.1% majority). Here is thefull slate of candidates in Richmond Park. Theresa Villiers, who heads up that department, is not far behind, having won Chipping Barnet by just 353 votes (0.6%).  Here is thefull list of candidates. Four more cabinet members find themselves in marginal seats too: Justice SecretaryRobert Bucklandwon with a majority of 2,464 (4.8%) inSwindon South International Development SecretaryAlok Sharmawon with a majority of 2,876 (5.6%) inReading West Northern Powerhouse ministerJake Berrywon with a majority of 3,216 (6.4%) inRossendale and Darwen, Lancashire Chief WhipMark Spencerwon with a majority of 5,198 (9.7%) inSherwood, Nottinghamshire And former Welsh secretaryAlun Cairns- who resigned his cabinet position at the start of the election over claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial - is still running despite the scandal, with a majority of just 2,190 (4.1%) in theVale of Glamorgan. A few other notable Tory seats from 2017 will also come under the spotlight on 12 December. Prominent Brexiteer and former Tory leaderIain Duncan Smithwill be fighting to keep his seat ofChingford and Woodford Greenon the North East London/Essex border, having won with just a 2,438 (5.2%) majority two years ago. And whileBroxtowein Nottinghamshire saw a Tory candidate squeeze through to win with a majority of just 863 (1.6%),Anna Soubryis now the leader of the anti-Brexit Independent Group for Change, making the Leave-supporting area very much in play. Theresa Villiers (left) hopes to remain a Tory MP, while Anna Soubry (right) will be fighting against them So, what about the Labour frontbench? It seems a little more certain for the big names in the party - although anything can happen on polling night. TakeJeremy Corbyn'smajority in his north London seat ofIslington Northlast time. He came in with a whopping 60.5% majority - working out at over 33,000 votes. And shadow chancellorJohn McDonnellcame in with a 37.9% majority in his west London seat ofHayes and Harlington- over 18,000 votes. But a couple of significant names fall into the marginal category. Will Dennis Skinner still be Labour's longest-serving MP? Lesley Lairdis the deputy leader of Scottish Labour and the shadow secretary for Scotland, but she only secured herKirkcaldy and Cowdenbeathseat by a majority of 259 (0.6%). Shadow environment secretarySue Haymanalso held one of these close call seats -Workingtonin Cumbria - by 3,925 votes (a 9.4% majority). There is talk of veteran Labour firebrandDennis Skinner, known as the Beast ofBolsover, being a key target for the Tories, as the MP only just sneaked over the marginal line with a majority of 5,288 (11.4%). But other smaller majorities, such asEmma Dent CoadinKensington, west London - who won by just 20 votes (a 0.1% majority) - andRosie DuffieldinCanterbury- who won by just 187 votes (a 0.3% majority) - there may be lots of lesser known MPs facing the same stress. Both Lesley Laird (left) and Sue Hayman (right) are fighting in marginal seats for Labour What about the other parties? For the Lib Dems, there are two well-known faces who may be crossing their fingers at the count. Former leader of the partyTim Farronheld hisWestmorland and Lonsdaleseat in Cumbria by a majority of 777 (1.5%) in 2017. Deputy leader (and former leadership candidate)Sir Ed Daveyalso only secured his place inKingston and Surbiton, west London, with a 4,124 (6.6%) majority. But, while she sneaks over the 10% threshold, it could be a stressful night for leaderJo Swinson. She only won inDunbartonshire Eastwith a majority of 5,339 (10.3%). There are two well-known SNP figures to watch out for. Joanna Cherry, the party's spokesman for justice - who has come to prominence heading a court case against Mr Johnson's unlawful prorogation - wonEdinburgh South Westby 1,097 (a 2.2% majority). AndMhairi Black- the so-called ""baby of the House"" as the youngest member - who is the SNP's spokeswoman on a number of issues, including disability and equalities, wonPaisley and Renfrewshire Southby a 2,541 majority (6.1%). The final one to look out for isNigel Dodds. He leads the DUP in Westminster and has been key in negotiations between his party and both Mr Johnson's and Theresa May's governments. But with a majority of just 2,081 (4.5%) inBelfast North, there could be shockwaves across Northern Ireland at his departure.

Australian broadcaster Clive James dies aged 80,"James died ""peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family"", his agents said Clive James, the Australian writer and broadcaster known around the world for his dry wit, has died at the age of 80. Diagnosed with leukaemia in 2010, the author and critic had movingly written about his terminal illness during the final years of his life. Born Vivian James in 1939, he moved to England in 1961 and rose to prominence as a literary critic and TV columnist. He went on to deliver wry commentary on international programming in such shows as Clive James On Television. Clive James in his own words Clive James obituary: 'A man of substance' The show saw him introduce amusing and off-beat TV clips from around the world, most famously from Japanese game show Endurance. According to a statement from his agents,external, he died at home in Cambridge on Sunday.  A private funeral was held on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College. ""Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis, and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,"" the statement read. Clive James pictured on the set of Saturday Night Clive in 1989 ""He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humour, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this 'great, good world'. ""He was grateful to the staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital [in Cambridge] for their care and kindness, which unexpectedly allowed him so much extra time. ""His family would like to thank the nurses of the Arthur Rank Hospice at Home team for their help in his last days, which allowed him to die peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books."" Singer Alison Moyet was among many to pay tribute to a man she described as a ""bright, beaming boy,external"".

""We were lucky to have him at all."" Monty Python star Eric Idle expressed his sadness at losing ""dear Clive James my pal at Cambridge"". Reverend Richard Coles said he was ""the best telly critic that ever there was,external"", while Margarita Pracatan - the Cuban singer James helped make a household name -paid tribute,externalto his ""intelligence... talent and beautiful way of living"". James was ""unquestionably the greatest Australian poet of his time"", said George Brandis, Australia's High Commissioner to the UK, adding to tributes in the writer's beloved homeland. Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said the ""irreplaceable"" James was ""a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster"". ""He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing,"" Lord Hall continued. James was renowned for his pithy turns of phrase. He once likened Arnold Schwarzenegger to ""a brown condom full of walnuts"" and said motor racing commentator Murray Walker sounded ""like a man whose trousers are on fire"". He was equally waspish when describing Dame Barbara Cartland, whose eyes he said ""looked like the corpses of two small crows that had crashed into a chalk cliff"". ""Common sense and a sense of humour are the same thing, moving at different speeds,"" was another of his famous quotes. He also had advice for his future obituarists, telling them ""shorter is better, and that a single line is best"". ""Any encounter with James, either in print or in person, left you desperate to go and open a book, watch a film or a TV show, or hunt down a recording,"" said Don Paterson, poetry editor at James's publisher Picador.

Key manifesto policies explained,"The SNP has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan ""Stronger for Scotland"". It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce. Thefull document runs to 52 pages,external. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day,12 December? Keep Scotland in the EU by supporting a second Brexit referendum with Remain on the ballot paper. About a third of Scotland's million Leave voters at the Brexit referendum in 2016 were also supporters of Scottish independence. However, Nicola Sturgeon has come down firmly in favour of the UK remaining within the EU, or re-joining it if Scotland becomes independent. At Westminster, the party's MPs have backed moves towards another Brexit referendum, so long as Remain is an option on the ballot paper. That continues to be the position in the current election's manifesto. If it comes to a choice for MPs between revoking Brexit and ""no deal"" with the European Union, the SNP says it would back revocation. In addition, Brexit is seen by the SNP as such a big change to the UK constitution that it warrants another vote on Scottish independence, or indyref2 as it has been dubbed. Even if Brexit is thrown into reverse the SNP will still use any leverage it has after this election to secure indyref2, arguing that the Brexit ""chaos"" will continue for years. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Ask the UK government to give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum next year on independence. Precisely nobody will be surprised to see support for an independence referendum in the SNP manifesto. To be clear, the party already believes it has several mandates for a new poll, but hopes that a big win on 12 December will really cement its case. This is because the big question about indyref2 is how it comes about. Nicola Sturgeon wants an agreement with the UK government before holding a vote, but has seen theConservatives rule this out completely,externalandLabour say it wouldn't be on the table in the ""early years"" of a new government.,external If Ms Sturgeon is to get a referendum on her 2020 timetable, something needs to give - and she wants the result of this election to send a big message to both potential prime ministers about ""Scotland's future being in Scotland's hands"". The constitution is reserved to Westminster. Can Nicola Sturgeon deliver Scottish independence? Demand that the UK government raise health spending in the UK to match health spending in Scotland. Health is a devolved issue meaning spending and policy are decisions for the Scottish government. The SNP has been in power in Scotland for a more than decade andhas been under scrutiny over its domestic record. But that doesn't stop the SNP wanting to influence what happens at Westminster. Scotland spends more per head on health than any other part of the UK. This is partly to support rural services, but historically Scotland has faced a number of public health challenges. The SNP says to get its support in the event of a hung parliament, spending on the NHS across the UK needs to increase by billions of pounds. Pushing up spending per head in the UK to the same level as Scotland would then give a further boost to the block grant from the Treasury to Holyrood. That would mean health spending in Scotland would remain proportionally higher than the rest of the UK. Health is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy. The SNP could not form a majority government, so there's no costed budget with this manifesto. That will be for the Holyrood elections in May 2021. So there are demands for additional spending, without making clear the source of these funds. The big ask of the next chancellor is to reverse the spending squeeze over the past decade. There's a claim in the manifesto that deficit reduction measures by the Treasury have led to Â£13.9bn less spending on public services in Scotland (between 2010-2011 and 2019-2020) than would otherwise have been the case. While the Conservatives plan to increase the level at which employees start to pay National Insurance, the SNP wants both to freeze that level and to devolve power over that system, so that it can be integrated with Holyrood's income tax powers. The other big tax-and-spend change would be to take the Â£8.5bn in tax revenue projected (by the Office for Budget Responsibility) over five years from UK offshore oil and gas, and to apply it to a ""net zero fund"", to help the transition of energy use. That is a change from past SNP spending plans, which looked to oil and gas revenue to fund public services. Most taxes are decided by Westminster, including National Insurance. Get rid of the UK's nuclear deterrent and spend the money on public services. The SNP has long called for the removal of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines from Scottish waters. Nicola Sturgeonhas recently stated it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government. Jeremy Corbyn, too, has long been an opponent of nuclear weapons, but official Labour Party policy(restated in its manifesto),external- like that of the Conservatives - is to support the renewal of Trident. The Liberal Democrats say they'd keep Trident but reduce the nuclear posture of round-the-clock patrols with three instead of four submarines. The trouble is that the Westminster Parliament has already given the green light to build four new submarines to carry the Trident missiles at a cost of Â£35bn. That work is already well under way. The SNP still believes scrapping Trident would free up tens of billions of pounds to strengthen conventional forces and to spend on hospitals and schools. But critics of the SNP position warn that scrapping Trident would hit the local economy on the Clyde where the submarines are based. They also argue it could jeopardise Britain's position as a recognised nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council. Defence is a reserved power of Westminster. Introduce a bill to protect the health service from privatisation and future trade deals. The future of the NHS - and its part in any post-Brexit trade deals - has already been a major battleground in this election. Although the Scottish government is responsible for running the health service in Scotland, there have been concerns that after Brexit, trade negotiations between the UK and US could lead to American companies bidding for contracts and pushing up the cost of drugs. The SNP's NHS Protection Act would enshrine in law that the NHS is protected as publicly-owned and operated with its services publicly commissioned. The SNP says it will stop the health service becoming a lever in any kind of international trade deal. Crucially the legislation says any trade deal would require the consent of all the devolved parliaments and assemblies to ensure it did not impact on the health service. However, the Conservatives have strongly denied the NHS would ever be used as a bargaining tool. Expect to hear more about it during the campaign. Trade is a reserved power, however the government has pledged to involve devolved powers in talks. Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Sturgeon announces plans for NHS protection bill CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external Devolve drug classification powers to Holyrood. Scotland has a drugs death crisis. There is an escalating number of drug deaths in Scotland - in 2018 a record total of 1,187. Thedeath rate in Scotland is the worst in the EUand three times higher than the UK as a whole. The SNP has voiced frustration that some radical solutions cannot be explored. At present, drugs policy is reserved to Westminster under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. The SNP manifesto wants the power to allow a consumption room in Glasgow where users could inject or smoke their own illegal drugs. But this has been put on holdbecause the Home Office refused permissionfor Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, to grant legal protection for it. The SNP argues the proposal would connect hard-to-reach users with drug treatment services and help cut the death toll among older addicts. It's a high-profile pledge but they acknowledge it's just one part of an issue that will require long-term action. Drugs policy is reserved to Westminster, whilst public health is devolved. Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts Demand the UK government matches Holyrood's climate change targets. While some parties have been throwing around new dates for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, the SNP has not. But then the ink is barely dry onScottish legislation which set 2045 as the new target year. Instead it commits its MPs to push the new UK government into helping Scotland achieve that target through accelerating the deployment of carbon capture, usage and storage -  a key technology for tackling the climate crisis - and matching Scotland's 2032 date for all new cars to be electric. It also wants taxation reformed to support ""greener choices"", like making our homes more energy-efficient. But the SNP insists Brexit must not be allowed to derail the train carrying us towards net-zero. And - unsurprisingly - suggests that the key to going even further in addressing climate change is... independence. Some energy policy is reserved, however Scotland has a number of powers for reducing climate emissions. Pass power over immigration to the Scottish Parliament so Scotland can have a migration system that works for its economy and society. Scotland faces more acute problems from demographic change than the rest of the UK. As the workforce is projected to shrink and the older population rises, it has had a slower inflow of migrants from overseas than England. There is a political consensus on the need to tackle the issue, with a more welcoming attitude to immigrants. Social attitude surveys, however, do not find such a big difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK. With the end of free movement of EU citizens, Brexit raises special challenges to several sectors of the economy, including the NHS, social care, construction and agriculture. Issues with a disproportionate presence in Scotland include food processing, tourism and universities. The SNP wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. It wants to cut the cost for employers of recruiting from overseas, and to simplify the visa and citizenship process. The party also says there should be a more welcoming approach to asylum seekers. If Scotland became independent and were then to re-join the European Union, it is accepted that membership would require the free movement of EU citizens, potentially leading to issues over the border between Scotland and England. Immigration is reserved to Westminster. Up the provision of paid leave for parents and encourage dads to take more time off. All the parties are making some kind of offer to new parents. The SNP's goes further than most. Nicola Sturgeon says its offer would be a ""game changer""- a new 12-week use-it-or-lose-it period of ""daddy leave"". Parents are currently entitled to convert up to 50 weeks of their 52-week maternity leave to shared parental leavebut take-up by dads has been ""stubbornly low"". The SNP is offering to extend this to 64 weeks with 12 weeks ring-fenced for fathers to encourage them to take the time off with their new babies. In addition it is offering to increase statutory pay and introduce stronger protections against redundancy for new parents. How the SNP could introduce this is open to question. Parental leave is covered by employment law and this is decided by Westminster, not Holyrood, so the SNP would need to win the support of other parties or introduce a private members' bill to deliver this proposal. Parental leave is reserved to Westminster. To find out more read oursimple guide to the SNP Give the Scottish Parliament control of employment law and more benefits. The SNP wants powers over employment rights to be devolved to Holyrood. With or without them, it wants the statutory living wage (which is Â£8.21 for those aged 25 and over) to go up to the ""real living wage"" - calculated on the basis of what workers need - by increasing it by Â£1.09 per hour on this year's figures. There is also a call for better protection for those on insecure work contracts. On welfare, the Scottish government is gathering newly devolved powers at Holyrood, pushing up the budget with a transfer of around Â£3bn next year. This is being used to soften the system applied by Whitehall, although the complexity of devolving powers is proving problematic, and some changes have been delayed from 2021 to 2024. On those powers still held at Westminster, the SNP wants to see a halt to the roll-out of universal credit. It is pushing for the reversal of some controversial measures on benefit entitlement introduced in recent years, including the freeze on working-age benefits. Most benefits, including pensions and Universal Credit, and workers' rights are reserved to Westminster. Give Holyrood power over train services to build better, greener public transport. Can shifting power from Westminster to Holyrood help deliver cleaner, greener public transport? The SNP thinks so. It says rail passengers would get a better deal if the Scottish Parliament controls both track and train - that is, the train operator, Scotrail, and Network Rail, which maintains the lines, signalling and many stations. Right now, Network Rail is ultimately controlled by Westminster. The SNP wants that to change. Why? Bitter experience shows passengers get fed up with delays caused by repair and upgrading works - and often blame Scotrail, regardless of whether it is its fault. Closer working between track engineers and train operators, the SNP argues, would make planning easier - and reduce disruption for commuters. The SNP has rejected Labour's railway nationalisation plans. A single, GB-wide company would, it says, strip powers away from Scotland. But it has left open the option of a public sector operator running Scotrail services in the future. It has made this case before, but political horse-trading after this election could give it the breakthrough it wants. Most rail policy is reserved to Westminster.

Clive James: A man of substance,"Broadcaster, critic, poet, TV presenter and prolific author - Clive James cheerfully criss-crossed the boundaries between high and lowbrow. He was as much at home hosting a Shakespeare documentary as he was at fronting a programme showing people suffering indignities on Japanese TV. His sardonic tones graced a host of TV documentaries in which he brought his own acute observations to bear on a wide variety of subjects. A journalist on The Sydney Morning Herald once wrote: ""His gift and lasting contribution has been to recognise that mass appeal does not translate into lack of substance."" Australian broadcaster Clive James dies at 80 Clive James in his own words He was born Vivian James in Kogarah, south of Sydney, on 7 Oct 1939. He was later allowed to change his name when, according to his autobiography, Vivien Leigh's appearance in Gone With the Wind meant the name would forever be seen as female, no matter what the spelling. His father was captured by the Japanese during World War Two and forced to work as a slave labourer. He managed to survive internment but was killed when the plane returning him to Australia crashed in Taiwan. The young James studied psychology at the University of Sydney, where he also edited the student magazine and directed a number of revues. After graduating, he went to work as a journalist on the Sydney Morning Herald. In 1961 he set off for England, where for three years he led what he described as a ""would-be bohemian existence"" in London, working at a variety of jobs before gaining a place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where Germaine Greer was among his contemporaries. Clive James presented a BBC perspective on Shakespeare in 1980 He later confessed that he read very little of the course material, but did busy himself by writing for various periodicals, including The Listener and the Cambridge Review.  He became president of the Cambridge Footlights, and represented Pembroke on University Challenge. In 1972 he was commissioned by the Times Literary Supplement to write an appreciation of the noted writer and critic Edmund Wilson. His piece, published without a byline as was traditional at the TLS at the time, triggered a wave of speculation as to who had actually written it, and cemented James's reputation. He began a 10-year spell as a TV critic on The Observer, delivering a column that his fellow critic, Mark Lawson, once described as so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink. James with Michael Parkinson and Janet Street Porter in 1982 His strength was to write about the most banal television programmes in a high literary style, and he would often mix a critique of a serious documentary with comments on something more downmarket. His style would be widely copied by subsequent columnists. His job as a TV critic led to him being asked to make guest appearances on various programmes. One notable episode was on the Granada pop music programme So It Goes, when he found himself trying to keep a new band, The Sex Pistols, under control. ""One had grown used to pop performers dressing up in silly clothes and pretending to be horrible,"" he wrote in his column. ""But here were performers dressing up in silly clothes who really were horrible."" In 1982, ITV hired him to front a new show called Clive James on Television, which showed a series of amusing and offbeat TV clips from around the world. He was a prolific poet and author Excerpts from the Japanese programme, Endurance, became a regular feature. Contestants had to withstand unpleasant experiences such as being lowered into a tank full of insects, or being buried up to their necks in sand. James denied suggestions that he was being racist for highlighting a Japanese programme, explaining that he felt it was better that, if people were going to torment each other, they did it within the confines of a game show. He also fronted a travel programme, which transferred to the BBC in 1989 under the title Clive James's Postcard From. In 1993 the BBC broadcast his eight-part documentary series, Fame In The Twentieth Century, which used archive material to explore the nature of fame through each of the previous eight decades. The programme was also aired by ABC in Australia and PBS in the US. He was a regular voice on BBC Radio 4, and in 2008 he performed two one-man shows at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival. He also worked with songwriter and producer Pete Atkin on six musical albums during the 1970s, which were re-released on CD 20 years later, when the pair made a number of live performances. His television work did not distract him from writing. As well as publishing collections of poetry, he wrote four novels and five volumes of autobiography - the first of which, Unreliable Memoirs, was reprinted more than 60 times. He also published collections of his numerous essays and newspaper articles. In 1997 he penned a poignant piece for the New Yorker titled I Wish I'd Never Met Her, describing his reactions to the death of his friend, Diana, Princess of Wales. His illness failed to dampen his natural good humour He made a number of appearances on the BBC's Question Time and also appeared alongside Paul Merton on the satirical quiz Have I Got News For You. A lifetime of smoking and drinking culminated in a diagnosis of emphysema and kidney failure in 2010, and a year later he announced he had leukaemia. In a 2012 interview, he told BBC radio he was ""near the end"", saying: ""I don't want to cast a gloom, an air of doom, over the programme but I'm a man who is approaching his terminus."" Three years later, in an interview with the Guardian, he spoke of his ""embarrassment"" at still being alive, saying a new drug had kept the end at bay. This February, he had a long and ultimately unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek, which left him frail and almost blind. An atheist by conviction, James famously described religion as ""an advertising agency for a product that does not exist."" He was sanguine about his own end, maintaining a short biography on his website, which he hoped would be used as the basis for any appreciation of his life that might be written. Journalists writing an obituary should ""keep in mind that shorter is better, and that a single line is best"", it said. His life was much too full to fulfil that final wish.

Clive James 'saying goodbye',"James has written several books of poetry, including Poem of the Year and the satirical Peregrine Prykke's Pilgrimage Through the London Literary World Terminally ill author and critic Clive James says he has ""started saying goodbye"" through his poetry. The 74-year-old, who has leukaemia and emphysema, has written of having ""lungs of dust"" in his most recent work,Sentenced To Life,external. ""Inevitably, you start saying goodbye,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sToday programme. ""I like to think that I hit a sort of plangent tone. A sort of last post, a recessional tone. But the trick is not to overdo it."" He continued: ""As my friend PJ O'Rourke told me, 'you're going to have to soft pedal this death door stuff, Clive, because people are going to get impatient.'"" Born in Australia, James moved to England in 1961, and rose to prominence as a literary critic and television columnist. He later became well-known for his TV work, including Clive James On Television, in which he delivered sardonic commentary on international programming, such as the Japanese gameshow Endurance. The writer and broadcaster interviewed Frank Sinatra for a BBC special in 1988 A successful author and poet, he was nominated for last year's Costa prize for his translation of Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy. He was diagnosed with leukaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2010 and has beenclose to deathon several occasions. But, he told presenter James Naughtie, he maintains a positive outlook. ""It's important not to be morbid,"" he said. ""The secret there is to keep a sense of proportion. I'm at the hospital two or three times a week usually and... if you hang around a hospital long enough, you'll see things that'll remind you that you've had a lucky life. If you can see at all, you've had a lucky life. He added: ""I'm getting near to what my friend [film director] Bruce Beresford calls the departure lounge - but I've got a version of it that doesn't hurt, so I may as well enjoy myself as long as I can."" James has continued to write, and said he was putting the finishing touches to a book of essays about poetry, and why it has exerted such a pull on him throughout his life. He joked that if he was to ""drop off the twig"", the book could be published posthumously, ""which is good for the family finances"". Although his energy levels have dropped and his voice is more hesitant than before, James will make a rare stage appearance on Saturday 31 May at London's Australian and New Zealand literature festival. He intends to recite passages from The Divine Comedy and a poem he wrote for Anzac Day. ""But,"" he added, ""I'll probably spend most of the time talking about Game Of Thrones"". James said he missed Australia, and regretted he would never see Sydney again James also admitted he was mourning for Australia, which he will never see again, as his lung condition means he cannot travel by air. However, he said: ""I have my memories of growing up in Australia, and those memories become clearer all the time. In fact, I'm writing about them all the time in my poetry. ""The mind is quite a wonderful thing. It can translate past experience into immediate experience. I practically hallucinate the sheer beauty of Sydney Harbour. It couldn't be more vivid in actuality than it is in my recollection. ""So, no, I don't despair although I do miss it."" As the wide-ranging interview concluded, James said he was ""content"", despite his recent setbacks. ""My disasters haven't been that bad, even the personal ones,"" he said. ""My family is still together. ""Even with my health, things could have been worse. It could have hurt, for example, and it didn't. So I  haven't got all that much to be miserable about. ""I like to think I have a sunny nature, but a sunny nature doesn't last long if you're in real pain. I've just been lucky."" Clive James up for Costa award Clive James on his obsession with Dante.

"Man stabbed to death while on phone to his mumPaul Smith's mother heard him pleading for help as he was being attacked by a stranger with scissors.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Paul Smith was on the phone to his mother when he was targeted A mother was on the phone to her son when he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him to death with a pair of scissors, a court has heard. IT analyst Paul Smith, 28, was attacked by George McAdam near Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh in May. A court heard McAdam had only been freed from prison two weeks earlier. Prosecutors accepted his not guilty plea on the basis he ""lacked criminal responsibility"" at the time of the attack due to a mental disorder. McAdam was formally acquitted at the High Court in Glasgow. The court heard Mr Smith had been returning to work at Edinburgh University when he wasattacked by McAdamand stabbed 32 times. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said: ""He was still chatting to his mother by telephone. ""She then describes hearing 'a horrific scream'. She heard her son saying: 'Help me... need police, need police."" Margaret immediately yelled to her husband Ian to dial 999. But Mr Smith did not survive the attack, which happened close to Edinburgh Castle. Police sealed off the scene in Johnston Terrace after the attack in May The court heard McAdam, 40, initially fled the scene but was rugby tackled by a passer-by in a nearby car park. McAdam, who had faced a murder charge, will remain at the State Hospital at Carstairs. The court heard he had been sleeping rough in Edinburgh at the time. McAdam had a lengthy list of convictions in Scotland and England, including for possession of a knife and assault. He had been freed from HMP Edinburgh on 15 May, just over a fortnight before the fatal attack. Mr Smith, of Balerno, was attacked at about 13:45 on 30 May, after visiting a KFC restaurant for lunch. Paul Smith was returning to his work in Edinburgh at the time of the attack Prosecutor, Ms Edwards told the court: ""His mum immediately told her husband to call police as their son needed help. ""She stayed on the phone to her son."" The court heard McAdam had grabbed Mr Smith, who tried to defend himself. Ms Edwards said: ""McAdam repeatedly stabbed him in the chest area. ""Paul Smith shouted 'he's stabbed me' and fell to the ground."" McAdam then dragged Mr Smith down a steep embankment while continuing the attack. The court heard he knelt beside his victim and struck him multiple times on the body and neck. Members of the public heard Mr Smith's cries for help but the court was told McAdam appeared ""oblivious"" to a crowd that was gathering. McAdam eventually ran off but was tracked to a nearby NCP car park. Police and paramedics spent more than 30 minutes trying to save Mr Smith, but Ms Edwards added: ""His injuries would not have been survivable even with medical intervention."" The court heard McAdam was later seen by psychiatrists and was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Lord Turnbull ordered him to remain at Carstairs on an interim compulsion order. The case will call again in February.

The social network said it now would not remove accounts until it had a process for ""memorialising"" dead users on the network. It admitted not having a policy in place was a ""miss on our partâ. The firm said it was taking action on inactive accounts due to regulatory concerns. It said once it had a full process in place, account deactivations would occur in the EU first. This was in order, Twitter said, to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ""We apologise for the confusion and will keep you all posted,"" the company said in aseries of tweets posted on Wednesday,external. Twitter: 'My boyfriend died but I still like to read his tweets' Twitter shares plunge as profit falls short On Monday Twitter had begun contacting users who hadn't logged in in the past six months, warning them that they would have their accounts deleted unless they signed in and agreed to the firm's latest privacy policy. After reporting from the BBCand others, the company admitted it had not considered the issue of the potential upset that would be caused by the removal of accounts belonging to users who had died. Writing on TechCrunch, Drew Olanoff, a communications officer at investment firm Scaleworks, said his ""heart sank"" when he learned of Twitter's plans, as he often checked in on his father's account, several years after his death. ""Itâs my way, odd or not, of remembering him. Keeping his spirit alive. His tweets are timestamped moments that he shared with the world,""Mr Olanoff wrote,external.  ""And Twitter is sweeping them up like crumpled-up paper and junk in a dustbin.â Other networks, such as Facebook, offer a process called ""memorialisation"", whereby verified family members or other loved ones can request a deceased user's account is kept on the network, but frozen in time. Interactions with the account are limited in order to help prevent trolling and other abuse. Twitter said it would create such a tool. It added: ""Beyond complying with GDPR, we may broaden the enforcement of our inactivity policy in the future to comply with other regulations around the world and to ensure the integrity of the service. ""We will communicate with all of you if we do."" _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Open door on 80mph train 'due to loose screws',"The door of the carriage was open for 23 minutes Loose screws were to blame for a door being open on a passenger train going at 80mph (128km/h), a report found. The train travelled 16 miles through Essex once the screws fell out, before a passenger alerted the driver. A Rail Accident Investigation Board (RAIB) report said operator Greater Anglia had since found loose screws on ""at least 60 doorways"" in its fleet of refurbished class 321 carriages. The company said it had improved safety procedures and brought in extra checks. The screws fixing the door bracket to the closing mechanism showed no signs of having been tightened properly during refurbishment, said the report. The missing screws meant that the door mechanism, unattached to the door, was able to return to the closed position - giving the driver the incorrect signal that all doors were shut. This graphic shows how the missing screws allowed the door to stay open while telling the driver that it was closed The door wasopen for 23 minutes,externaluntil it was reported at Hockley station, Essex, at 07:20 BST on 22 August, and the screws and washers were found by the driver. The RAIB said the screws in the refurbished units should have been tightened and a yellow line drawn across the screw head and bracket, so that any loosening would be recognised - but no marks were found. This meant ""one of the visual indications of a loose screw was absent, reducing the likelihood of checks identifying any loosening"", saidthe RAIB,external. Greater Anglia has since retightened all door screws on its refurbished carriages to the correct torque after discussions with the parts manufacturer. A spokesperson for Greater Anglia apologised to passengers, and said it took safety ""extremely seriously"". ""We have co-operated fully with RAIB in their investigations as well as carrying out our own investigation,"" she said. ""We have introduced new more stringent safety procedures and are committed to carrying out additional checks on our trains' doors from now on.""

Couple fall victim to holiday scam,"This video can not be played Simone and Alice Cardillo say they fell victim to a false Airbnb listing in Belfast A couple have spoken of how they became victims of a holiday scam during a trip to Northern Ireland. Simone and Alice Cardillo arrived at their accommodation in Belfast to find it was empty and for sale. They had booked and paid for the bogus property using the booking site, Airbnb. It later refunded the money and removed the fake post. It said these types of scams are extremely rare on its site, but when they do happen, it acts quickly. Airbnb will verify listings, 11 years after launch Effect of Airbnb surge on UK cities revealed Council-tenant Airbnb host fined Â£100,000 ""From the outside you could tell there was something weird,"" said Simone who comes from Italy. ""We rang the door and nobody answered. It didn't look like an Airbnb or like anyone was living there,"" said his French partner Alice. ""We called the host, it was a woman and she told us that it wasn't here and that she wasn't living in Belfast. ""We were pretty stranded. We had our big backpacks and we didn't know what to do. We spent the whole afternoon and evening trying to find a new place."" Those behind these scams are thought to be able to create new listings again, meaning more people get caught out. Police Service of Northern Ireland chief superintendent Simon Walls said the whole holiday market is a place where people need to be careful and be sure that what they are booking is genuine. ""We know of people who've booked what they've thought are really good value weekends in good hotels and they've turned up to find there's been no booking,"" he said. The accommodation the couple paid for never existed, they said ""We've heard of people who've booked expensive apartments in Spain and it's either been a building site or there's nothing there."" Police suspect most of the scammers are operating thousands of miles away. ""If you're booking a holiday that seems too cheap or if you're booking an apartment or hotel and you're not sure it exists, there are ways you can check it out,"" he said. ""You can find out addresses, you can look at photographs and check online reviews. And all that gives you some sort of hint on whether the premises actually exists."" These types of scams are also affecting people from Northern Ireland who are booking accommodation abroad. In July, Scamwise NI, reported that a woman from County Armagh fell victim to a holiday scam after booking a holiday to Spain. She paid Â£1,350 for accommodation in an apartment for a week. Closer to the time of her holiday she tried contacting them to arrange for the collection of keys but the website had disappeared and no one responded to her. Last month, Lord Alan Sugar warned his twitter followers of Airbnb scams after an American family of six turned up at one of his properties in London. He claimed they had paid over $600 believing they were staying in one of his properties for three days after scammers took a photo from an estate agents web site. Airbnb said these types of scams are extremely rare on their site, but when they do happen they act quickly. ""Fake or misrepresented listings have no place in our community and our systems constantly evaluate hundreds of risk signals to identify and stop bad actors. Our team works tirelessly on tools to stay ahead of fraudsters, strengthen our defences and educate hosts and guests about protecting their personal details and staying safe online.""

Russia hails spy who 'foiled Churchill death plot',"Goar Vartanyan with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005 Russia has paid tribute to a former Soviet intelligence officer it credits with uncovering a Nazi plot to kill the Allied leaders Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt during World War Two. Goar Vartanyan died on Monday at the age of 93. She was married to Soviet spy Gevork Vartanian, who died in 2012. Without the pair ""the history of our world could have been different"", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""These are people who left their mark on the history of mankind."" Soviet spying legend Gevork Vartanian dies at 87 Born in what was then Soviet Armenia in 1926, Vartanyan moved to Iran in the 1930s. At 16 she joined an anti-fascist group led by her future husband, who was already working as a spy. They allegedly exposed hundreds of Nazi agents in the country. The group was given responsibility for securing a 1943 conference in the Iranian capital, Tehran, where the British, Soviet and American leaders met to discuss their strategy for fighting the war. Josef Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Tehran conference The group are said to have uncovered a plot - known as Operation Long Jump - to kill the ""Big Three"" Allied leaders and arrested the would-be Nazi assassins. The plot was allegedly commanded by the infamous Austrian-born Nazi commando Otto Skorzeny but was foiled after transmissions were intercepted by Soviet operatives. However, Skorzeny later wrote in his memoirs that the plot never existed. Goar and Gevork Vartanyan moved to the Soviet Union in 1951 and later worked together as spies posted overseas under deep cover - as part of the so-called ""illegals"" programme - from 1956 to 1986, Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency said. Her code name was Anita and his Anri. The man who turned Soviet spies into Americans Mr Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, said Russia's leader - a former intelligence agent -  knew the pair well. ""He is a Hero of the Soviet Union! She is the heroine of all his achievements! He passed away first. She passed away today,"" the SVR said in a statement.

University's looted bronze cockerel to be repatriated,"Jesus College's bronze cockerel - similar to this one - will now be repatriated to Nigeria A bronze cockerel at Cambridge University that had been looted in a British raid on what is now Nigeria will be repatriated. The Benin bronze, known as an ""okukor"", was bequeathed to Jesus College in 1930 by a former British Army officer. In 2016 it wasremoved from displayand the Legacy of Slavery Working Party (LSWP) has recommended it be returned. Master of Jesus College Sonita Alleyne said they were not trying to ""erase history"". She said the decision came after ""diligent and careful"" work of the LSWP into the legacy of slavery at Jesus College. ""We are an honest community, and after thorough investigation into the provenance of the Benin bronze, our job is to seek the best way forward,"" she added. The LSWP, which includes academics and students, was set up earlier this year by the college to to investigate historic links it may have to the slave trade. Sonita Alleyne was elected Master of Jesus College, a role which she took up in October Almost 1,000 bronzes were taken after Benin City, in present-day Nigeria, was occupied by imperial troops in 1897, according to the British Museum. About 900 of those artefacts are housed in museums and collections around the world, including the British Museum. Jesus College's bronze cockerel, donated by Captain George William Neville, whose son had been a student there, took pride of place in the college dining hall. The Benin bronze statue was prominently displayed in the college dining hall Earlier this month Aboriginal artefacts taken from Australia more than 100 years agowere handed back by Manchester Museum. Indigenous leaders came to the UK collect 12 items, including sacred ceremonial artefacts and a garment made with emu feathers.

Rail passengers 'stranded' as cable snaps,"All services running north of Preston have been cancelled until Thursday Hundreds of passengers on the West Coast Mainline were stranded for hours after an electric overhead cable snapped. The cable broke on the route between Lancaster and Preston at about 08:35 GMT, blocking both lines in both directions, Network Rail said. One person tweeted they were on a train for seven-and-a-half hours, another called it ""an absolute horror show"". Stations along the route became crowded as the delays continued. Network Rail said that section of the line would be closed for the rest of the day. ""Our immediate focus is to fix the cables in time for start of service tomorrow,"" a spokesperson said. Passengers have been queuing at stations for rail replacement buses Virgin Trains said a rescue locomotive retrieved two trains and a third was involved in a train-to-train evacuation. Northern and Trans Pennine Express services in the area were also affected. All Caledonian Sleeper services were also cancelled. Passengers expecting to use the route were advised not to travel, and were earlier warned journey times would be at least three hours longer than usual. Crowds gathered at Preston station while the delays to services continued Simon Mabon was travelling from Macclesfield to Lancaster and said his journey - which would normally take about 90 minutes - took about eight hours. This video can not be played Simon Mabon said there was no air conditioning and the toilets stopped working quickly on his stuck train Another passenger, Russ Dank, said there was a ""bit of a mutiny"" on a train he was stranded on in between Preston and Lancaster. ""There were quite a few people shouting because there have been no toilets and it is quite cold... and no lighting for about four hours,"" he said. He added some people were ""kicking off"" as there was nowhere to go to the toilet, but those who were desperate were allowed to go on the ""line side"" which wasn't ""great circumstances"". All services between Preston and Lancaster have been cancelled until tomorrow Phil James, director for Network Rail's North West route, apologised for the issues. ""Our specialist electrical teams are working to repair the damaged cables. It means the railway is blocked with no trains running at present."" Network Rail added because of the lack of electrical power in the area it had made towing back difficult. Queues formed at Preston station while passengers waited for rail replacement services.

"Tata Steel to cut 1,000 jobs across the UK","This video can not be played What is the future for the UK steel industry? Plans to cut 1,000 jobs at Tata Steel ""appear"" to centre around the workforce in Wales, Economy Minister Ken Skates has said. Tata Steel announced on Wednesday it expects to cut the jobs across the UK as part of its restructuring plans. Two thirds of the job losses will be management and office-based roles, Tata said. In the Netherlands 1,600 positions are also set to go, with 350 others cut elsewhere in the world. Tata Steel's Europe CEO, Henrik Adam, said the company ""cannot afford to stand still"" as ""the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt"". Speaking in north Wales, Mr Skates said it would probably take until February 2020 for all the details to emerge but it ""appears to be the case"" 1,000 jobs could be cut from the Welsh workforce. ""This will understandably be a worrying time for Tata Steel employees and their families in Wales,"" he said. ""Tata Steel has previously confirmed that they intend to seek to avoid compulsory redundancies and I will be impressing on the company the importance of standing by this commitment."" Steel plant pledge after merger falters Jingye vows to save jobs after British Steel deal Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union which represents workers in the steel industry, said Tata's proposals had ""no credibility"" and had been poorly timed. ""I think the way the company have handled this has been atrocious, it's never a good time but having this announcement hit us a few weeks before Christmas is absolutely scandalous. ""There was no need for this announcement at all at this stage."" He toldBBC Radio Walesthe plans had ""no credibility"" for the unions and Tata had been told to ""go away, think again, and come back with a clear strategy, come back with a strategy for the future"". ""We want to know about investment, what the future holds and all they've done is come up with this awful proposal just to cut jobs."" Tata has one steelmaking site and five other facilities in Wales. Port Talbot employs 4,000 workers - nearly half of Tata's UK workforce - but the firm is yet to specify which UK locations will suffer the cuts. Mr Rickhuss said he understood most of the jobs at risk would be ""white collar and managerial jobs"". The firm first announcedplans to cut 3,000 jobs across its European businesslast week, in a bid to come to terms with a ""severe"" international steel market. In a bid to improve financial performance, the company also expects to increase its sales of higher-value steels, optimise production processes and reduce its procurement costs. Community said the job cuts were ""a consequence of management failure to have a Plan B following the collapsed of the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp"". It appears to be business as usual. Workers have been arriving for their shifts this morning with others leaving from the night shift. But, of course, it is far from a normal day here with Tata, once again, hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Obviously there are a lot of questions still to be answered, but the main one for most workers and their families in the run-up to Christmas is where those 1,000 jobs in the UK will be lost. Industry analyst Dr Kath Ringwald said the news was ""not unexpected"", adding: ""With current market conditions, it was going to be difficult for Tata to sustain production at current levels. ""They are taking measures to reduce their cost base in the hope of longer-term survival."" She said Tata had to do ""something radical"" because worldwide demand had ""flatlined"". ""It does not signal the end of steelmaking in the UK,"" she said. ""But to continue making it at the current rate may be optimistic."" Dr Ringwald added energy prices and business rates were higher in the UK than other steel-producing countries such as France and China, and the next government would face pressure to offer help. Port Talbot employs 4,000 workers - nearly half of Tata's UK workforce Bethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru Assembly Member for South Wales West, said: ""The next time Tata Steel make an announcement on potential job losses, I think everyone would prefer it come with more precise information."" David Rees, Labour AM for Aberavon, said the ""uncertainty"" of not knowing where the UK roles would be cut ""does not help steelworkers, their families and the wider community"". Suzy Davies, Conservative AM for South Wales West, said it was ""extremely distressing for all of the Port Talbot Tata Steel workers and their families"". Tata employs about 20,000 people worldwide and is owned by India's Tata. Tata's UK plants were put up for sale in March 2016, leading to months of uncertainty. However, the move was put on hold and a 10-year Â£1bn investment plan was announced for the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot - if market conditions allowed - along with a commitment to try to avoid compulsory job losses. Tata explored merger options with Thyssenkrupp over the next two years and a deal was finally agreed in the summer of 2018. Butcompetition concerns emergedover creating what would be Europe's second biggest steelmaker and the deal fell through. The European Commission, which blocked the merger, said the companies ""did not offer adequate remedies"" to pricing and competition concerns.

Five things we learned from the leaked trade papers,"Labour says leaked government documents show that the NHS would be at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claim was ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of formal talks. The 451-page document, leaked from the Department for International Trade,contains a record of discussions that have taken place between UK and US officials over a possible future trade deal. Here are five things we've learned from the document. US trade negotiators had already set outthat they wanted ""full market access"" for US drugs,externalas part of a future UK/US trade deal after Brexit. The leaked document does reiterateconcern in the US over drug prices. One of the trade representatives is quoted as saying: ""there is a lot of conversation on drug prices and looking at what other countries pay and this is causing angst"". A big part of the document, however, focuses on patents. Pharmaceutical companies can obtain patents which grant exclusive rights to sell and market drugs for 20 years in their country of origin. While the patent exists, other companies cannot manufacture cheaper copies of the drug - often called generics - in the same country. This applies in most countries around the world, but different countries have their own rules within that. There are already a lot of similarities between the patent system in the US and the UK, including on the length of patents. The leaked document compares the two systems in place for extending patents when they are delayed from entering the market. The US negotiators also suggest some other technical changes to the UK's patent regime, which could affect the relationship with European patent regimes. One of the main reasons for cheaper drug prices in the UK is the negotiating power of the NHS, as the near monopoly purchaser in the UK, whether the drugs are patented or generic. Jeremy Corbyn presented the leaked documents at a Labour Party press conference At the meeting on 10 July 2018, under the heading ""key points to note"", the document states: ""The US are very concerned at the contents of the Chequers statement."" This refers to the first draft of Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal with the European Union (EU) earlier that month. It proposeda ""common rulebook"" on goods with the EU. The document reveals that the US trade representatives were left ""deflated"" at the UK's plan to stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health. They saw this as a ""worst-case scenario"" for a UK-US trade deal. The Chequers agreement led to several ministerial resignations - including then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. His revised deal does not include any reference to a ""common rulebook"". In November 2017, the US told UK officials that it considered its food safety system to be ""the gold standard"", but acknowledged that its approach is different to the EU's. For example, while the EU is trying to reduce the amount of chemicals in food, the US continues to use them, including chlorine, as ""a final double check to remove any traces of pathogens"" - ie disease-causing viruses or bacteria. Chicken is often treated with a chlorine wash in the US to kill pathogens One US official suggested that the UK should not stick with the EU's food regulatory standards after Brexit. Instead, the US ""recommended that the UK maintains regulatory autonomy"". The same official suggested that the UK had used chemical washes to treat food in the past ""and wondered if there would be an interest in bringing them back post-EU Exit"". The document says the US would ""share their public lines on chlorine-washed chicken to help inform the media narrative around the issue"". How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? In the document from the November 2017 meeting, the US talked about its concerns over some food labelling. The US side said it was ""concerned that labelling food with high sugar content (as has been done with tobacco) is not particularly useful in changing consumer behaviour"". This goes against the UK's current public health strategy,which includes raising awareness of food labels through campaigns like Change4Life in England and Walesand Eat Better Feel Better in Scotland. In 2013, the UK government launched a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme, encouraging manufacturers to indicate the nutritional content of products, for example whether they are high in sugar or fat, using a traffic light scheme. The issue of climate change was raised at the meeting of the UK-US Trade and Investment Working Group, on 13-14 November 2017. A UK representative ""inquired about the possibility of including reference to climate change in a future UK-US trade agreement"". A US representative ""responded emphatically that climate change is the most political (sensitive) question for the US, stating it is a 'lightning rod issue'"". They went on to explain that they were bound by Congress not to include mention of greenhouse gas emission reductions in trade agreements. They stated this ban would not be lifted anytime soon. The UK has signed up to the Paris agreement on climate change and has set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The US, under President Trump, has said it intends to withdraw from the treaty. What is in the Paris climate agreement? The Department for International Trade said it would not comment on the leaked documents. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Theatre director Sir Jonathan Miller dies aged 85,"Miller was knighted in 2002 for services to music and the arts Sir Jonathan Miller, the distinguished theatre and opera director who famously starred in the Beyond the Fringe satirical revue, has died aged 85. In a statement, his family said he had died ""peacefully at home... following a long battle with Alzheimer's"". A man of many parts, Miller was also an author, a photographer, a sculptor, a broadcaster and a qualified doctor. Born in London in 1934, Miller studied medicine at Cambridge before embarking on a career in the arts. The catalyst was Beyond the Fringe, in which he appeared with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett. The groundbreaking revue premiered at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival before transferring to the West End and Broadway. Miller (far right) appeared in Beyond the Fringe with Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore Its success led to Miller becoming editor and presenter of BBC arts programme Monitor and a director of plays at the National Theatre. His productions included a modern-dress staging of The Merchant of Venice, with Laurence Olivier as Shylock. Obituary: Jonathan Miller He went on to direct six of the BBC's 1980s Shakespeare productions, among them The Taming of the Shrew with John Cleese and Othello with Anthony Hopkins. He served as artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 1987-90. Despite being unable to read music, he also directed operas for the ENO, Glyndebourne and the Met in New York. Who's Who listed his only recreation as ""deep sleep"". In a tribute, the Royal Opera House's director of opera Oliver Mears said Miller was ""one of the most important figures in British theatre and opera of the past half century"". He continued: ""Combining a supreme intellect with a consistently irreverent perspective, formed from his experiences in both comedy and medicine, Miller shone a unique light on our art form. ""His intolerance of inauthenticity and laziness on stage was matched by the urgency and rigour of his search for the composer's vision, historical accuracy and psychological truth - resulting in so many productions which have stood the test of time."" The English National Opera added on Twitter,external: ""His contribution to comedy, theatre and ENO in particular was immeasurable. For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO's most celebrated and popular opera productions."" Andthe National Theatre described him,externalas ""a legendary figure across theatre and opera"". Miller, who was knighted in 2002 for services to music and the arts, was witty and erudite but could be cantankerous. ""I've got this, I think, unjustified reputation for being grumpy,""he once said, insisting he only objected to ""people who are 30 years younger than I am and know 100% less than I do"". Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said Miller was ""a creative genius whose imagination knew no bounds... he brought arts and culture to millions on the BBC"". Monty Python star Eric Idle paid tribute to ""the beloved hilarious genius Jonathan Miller"", adding that Miller had ""dramatically changed my life three times"". He was alsoremembered by BBC Radio 3 broadcaster Petroc Trelawny,externalas ""a polymath and cultural giant"" whose ""contribution to British cultural life was as varied as it was vast"".

"Tata Steel to cut 1,000 UK jobsTwo-thirds of the job losses will be management and office-based roles, the firm says.Wales","This video can not be played What is the future for the UK steel industry? Plans to cut 1,000 jobs at Tata Steel ""appear"" to centre around the workforce in Wales, Economy Minister Ken Skates has said. Tata Steel announced on Wednesday it expects to cut the jobs across the UK as part of its restructuring plans. Two thirds of the job losses will be management and office-based roles, Tata said. In the Netherlands 1,600 positions are also set to go, with 350 others cut elsewhere in the world. Tata Steel's Europe CEO, Henrik Adam, said the company ""cannot afford to stand still"" as ""the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt"". Speaking in north Wales, Mr Skates said it would probably take until February 2020 for all the details to emerge but it ""appears to be the case"" 1,000 jobs could be cut from the Welsh workforce. ""This will understandably be a worrying time for Tata Steel employees and their families in Wales,"" he said. ""Tata Steel has previously confirmed that they intend to seek to avoid compulsory redundancies and I will be impressing on the company the importance of standing by this commitment."" Steel plant pledge after merger falters Jingye vows to save jobs after British Steel deal Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union which represents workers in the steel industry, said Tata's proposals had ""no credibility"" and had been poorly timed. ""I think the way the company have handled this has been atrocious, it's never a good time but having this announcement hit us a few weeks before Christmas is absolutely scandalous. ""There was no need for this announcement at all at this stage."" He toldBBC Radio Walesthe plans had ""no credibility"" for the unions and Tata had been told to ""go away, think again, and come back with a clear strategy, come back with a strategy for the future"". ""We want to know about investment, what the future holds and all they've done is come up with this awful proposal just to cut jobs."" Tata has one steelmaking site and five other facilities in Wales. Port Talbot employs 4,000 workers - nearly half of Tata's UK workforce - but the firm is yet to specify which UK locations will suffer the cuts. Mr Rickhuss said he understood most of the jobs at risk would be ""white collar and managerial jobs"". The firm first announcedplans to cut 3,000 jobs across its European businesslast week, in a bid to come to terms with a ""severe"" international steel market. In a bid to improve financial performance, the company also expects to increase its sales of higher-value steels, optimise production processes and reduce its procurement costs. Community said the job cuts were ""a consequence of management failure to have a Plan B following the collapsed of the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp"". It appears to be business as usual. Workers have been arriving for their shifts this morning with others leaving from the night shift. But, of course, it is far from a normal day here with Tata, once again, hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Obviously there are a lot of questions still to be answered, but the main one for most workers and their families in the run-up to Christmas is where those 1,000 jobs in the UK will be lost. Industry analyst Dr Kath Ringwald said the news was ""not unexpected"", adding: ""With current market conditions, it was going to be difficult for Tata to sustain production at current levels. ""They are taking measures to reduce their cost base in the hope of longer-term survival."" She said Tata had to do ""something radical"" because worldwide demand had ""flatlined"". ""It does not signal the end of steelmaking in the UK,"" she said. ""But to continue making it at the current rate may be optimistic."" Dr Ringwald added energy prices and business rates were higher in the UK than other steel-producing countries such as France and China, and the next government would face pressure to offer help. Port Talbot employs 4,000 workers - nearly half of Tata's UK workforce Bethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru Assembly Member for South Wales West, said: ""The next time Tata Steel make an announcement on potential job losses, I think everyone would prefer it come with more precise information."" David Rees, Labour AM for Aberavon, said the ""uncertainty"" of not knowing where the UK roles would be cut ""does not help steelworkers, their families and the wider community"". Suzy Davies, Conservative AM for South Wales West, said it was ""extremely distressing for all of the Port Talbot Tata Steel workers and their families"". Tata employs about 20,000 people worldwide and is owned by India's Tata. Tata's UK plants were put up for sale in March 2016, leading to months of uncertainty. However, the move was put on hold and a 10-year Â£1bn investment plan was announced for the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot - if market conditions allowed - along with a commitment to try to avoid compulsory job losses. Tata explored merger options with Thyssenkrupp over the next two years and a deal was finally agreed in the summer of 2018. Butcompetition concerns emergedover creating what would be Europe's second biggest steelmaker and the deal fell through. The European Commission, which blocked the merger, said the companies ""did not offer adequate remedies"" to pricing and competition concerns.

'We will sit in Black Friday shopper queue for you'A US couple are trying to make money out of sitting in Black Friday queues for shoppers.,"Alexis Granados and her husband A US couple is offering to camp out all night and hold places in the shopping queue for those who want to splurge on Black Friday deals. ""My husband has great ways of thinking when it comes to money,"" says Alexis Granados, of her partner Steven Velasquez. He recently lost his job as a scale operator for a recycling company. The pair are charging $50 (Â£38) each to wait outside any store in Upland, California, the night before the Black Friday sales. Being paid to queue is not new - but part of a growing phenomenon within what iscommonly known as the gig economy. On Task Rabbit and Bidvine, UK sites that advertise services from the self-employed, people can earn between Â£15 and Â£20 a time. Meanwhile, Placer, an app available in the US has been created solely to cater for people who are too busy to queue and willing to pay others to do it for them. An estimated 165.3 million people are expected to hit the shops in the US between Friday and Monday, the National Retail Federation says. The shopping bonanza, which originated in America, falls on the Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday - when workers in the US usually have the day off. And the California-based Granados couple say the work will help them to make ends meet. They are looking for more traditional jobs, but in the meantime say they're happy to pick up odd jobs where they can. Neither have done anything like this before, but she says ""I'm pretty sure it won't be our last time. It's actually easy money when you think about it"". The couple have a car, where they can warm up during their queuing time. They are advertising their queuing service on social media and several people have expressed an interest.  The duo guarantee a good place in the queue and if their customer is not satisfied they say they will not charge for the service. ""We used to be homeless, so it is not really a pain for us,"" says Ms Granados, saying the money means a lot to them. Currently the young couple, who are in their 20s, have a housing voucher that helped them get off the street.   ""It was actually a stepping stone for us and helped us grow as adults,"" says Ms Granados. Housing assistance in the US is offered to people with incomes under a certain threshold who need help finding a place to live. With a housing voucher, people can secure a place in social housing.

Clive James: 'A man of substance',"Broadcaster, critic, poet, TV presenter and prolific author - Clive James cheerfully criss-crossed the boundaries between high and lowbrow. He was as much at home hosting a Shakespeare documentary as he was at fronting a programme showing people suffering indignities on Japanese TV. His sardonic tones graced a host of TV documentaries in which he brought his own acute observations to bear on a wide variety of subjects. A journalist on The Sydney Morning Herald once wrote: ""His gift and lasting contribution has been to recognise that mass appeal does not translate into lack of substance."" Australian broadcaster Clive James dies at 80 Clive James in his own words He was born Vivian James in Kogarah, south of Sydney, on 7 Oct 1939. He was later allowed to change his name when, according to his autobiography, Vivien Leigh's appearance in Gone With the Wind meant the name would forever be seen as female, no matter what the spelling. His father was captured by the Japanese during World War Two and forced to work as a slave labourer. He managed to survive internment but was killed when the plane returning him to Australia crashed in Taiwan. The young James studied psychology at the University of Sydney, where he also edited the student magazine and directed a number of revues. After graduating, he went to work as a journalist on the Sydney Morning Herald. In 1961 he set off for England, where for three years he led what he described as a ""would-be bohemian existence"" in London, working at a variety of jobs before gaining a place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where Germaine Greer was among his contemporaries. Clive James presented a BBC perspective on Shakespeare in 1980 He later confessed that he read very little of the course material, but did busy himself by writing for various periodicals, including The Listener and the Cambridge Review.  He became president of the Cambridge Footlights, and represented Pembroke on University Challenge. In 1972 he was commissioned by the Times Literary Supplement to write an appreciation of the noted writer and critic Edmund Wilson. His piece, published without a byline as was traditional at the TLS at the time, triggered a wave of speculation as to who had actually written it, and cemented James's reputation. He began a 10-year spell as a TV critic on The Observer, delivering a column that his fellow critic, Mark Lawson, once described as so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink. James with Michael Parkinson and Janet Street Porter in 1982 His strength was to write about the most banal television programmes in a high literary style, and he would often mix a critique of a serious documentary with comments on something more downmarket. His style would be widely copied by subsequent columnists. His job as a TV critic led to him being asked to make guest appearances on various programmes. One notable episode was on the Granada pop music programme So It Goes, when he found himself trying to keep a new band, The Sex Pistols, under control. ""One had grown used to pop performers dressing up in silly clothes and pretending to be horrible,"" he wrote in his column. ""But here were performers dressing up in silly clothes who really were horrible."" In 1982, ITV hired him to front a new show called Clive James on Television, which showed a series of amusing and offbeat TV clips from around the world. He was a prolific poet and author Excerpts from the Japanese programme, Endurance, became a regular feature. Contestants had to withstand unpleasant experiences such as being lowered into a tank full of insects, or being buried up to their necks in sand. James denied suggestions that he was being racist for highlighting a Japanese programme, explaining that he felt it was better that, if people were going to torment each other, they did it within the confines of a game show. He also fronted a travel programme, which transferred to the BBC in 1989 under the title Clive James's Postcard From. In 1993 the BBC broadcast his eight-part documentary series, Fame In The Twentieth Century, which used archive material to explore the nature of fame through each of the previous eight decades. The programme was also aired by ABC in Australia and PBS in the US. He was a regular voice on BBC Radio 4, and in 2008 he performed two one-man shows at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival. He also worked with songwriter and producer Pete Atkin on six musical albums during the 1970s, which were re-released on CD 20 years later, when the pair made a number of live performances. His television work did not distract him from writing. As well as publishing collections of poetry, he wrote four novels and five volumes of autobiography - the first of which, Unreliable Memoirs, was reprinted more than 60 times. He also published collections of his numerous essays and newspaper articles. In 1997 he penned a poignant piece for the New Yorker titled I Wish I'd Never Met Her, describing his reactions to the death of his friend, Diana, Princess of Wales. His illness failed to dampen his natural good humour He made a number of appearances on the BBC's Question Time and also appeared alongside Paul Merton on the satirical quiz Have I Got News For You. A lifetime of smoking and drinking culminated in a diagnosis of emphysema and kidney failure in 2010, and a year later he announced he had leukaemia. In a 2012 interview, he told BBC radio he was ""near the end"", saying: ""I don't want to cast a gloom, an air of doom, over the programme but I'm a man who is approaching his terminus."" Three years later, in an interview with the Guardian, he spoke of his ""embarrassment"" at still being alive, saying a new drug had kept the end at bay. This February, he had a long and ultimately unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek, which left him frail and almost blind. An atheist by conviction, James famously described religion as ""an advertising agency for a product that does not exist."" He was sanguine about his own end, maintaining a short biography on his website, which he hoped would be used as the basis for any appreciation of his life that might be written. Journalists writing an obituary should ""keep in mind that shorter is better, and that a single line is best"", it said. His life was much too full to fulfil that final wish.

Clive James in his own words,"Clive James, who has died at the age of 80, was without parallel as an incisive and witty commentator on life - his own and other people's - as well as television and all forms of culture. Here are some of the most memorable lines from his books, reviews, programmes and interviews. ""It often happens that we are most touched by what we are least capable of. Evanescent delicacy is not the quality in the arts that I admire most, but it is often the characteristic by which I am most reduced to envy."" Unreliable Memoirs, 1980 ""It is almost better to be an impulse shirt-buyer than an impulse shoe-buyer. I have worn shirts that made people think I was a retired Mafia hit-man or a Yugoslavian sports convener from Split, but I have worn shoes that made people think I was insane."" Falling Towards England, 1985 ""All I can do is turn a phrase until it catches the light. There was a time when I got hot under the collar if the critics said I had nothing new to say. Now I realise that they had a point. My field is the self-evident. Everything I say is obvious, although I like to think that some of the obvious things I have said were not so obvious until I said them."" May Week Was in June, 1990 ""I think the control I had over my work was less than adequate. There was nothing wrong with the good bits in my poems, it's just that they were packed around with lots and lots of bad bits, and I think that the only way I've improved in the last several decades... is that I've learned to leave out the bad bits."" On ABC Radio, 2005 ""Unfortunately I can't [drive]. Or rather I can, but nobody believes in my ability enough to give me a licence."" Postcard from Los Angeles, BBC TV, 1990 ""Television is simultaneously blamed, often by the same people, for worsening the world and for being powerless to change it."" Glued to the Box, 1983 ""A painter can leave you with nothing left to say. A writer leaves you with everything to say."" Cultural Amnesia: Notes in the Margin of My Time, 2007 ""People don't get their morality from their reading matter: they bring their morality to it."" A Blizzard of Tiny Kisses, London Review of Books, 1980 ""Among artists without talent Marxism will always be popular, since it enables them to blame society for the fact that nobody wants to hear what they have to say."" The Crystal Bucket, 1982 ""The sure sign of a weak man who ascends to glory is that he can't tolerate having strong men around him."" North Face of Soho, 2006 ""It makes no sense whatsoever to call the perpetrators of the Holocaust 'the Germans' if by that is meant that the German victims of Naziism - including many Jews who went on regarding themselves as Germans to the end of the line - somehow weren't Germans at all. That's what the Nazis thought, and to echo their harebrained typology is to concede them their victory."" As Of This Writing, 2003 Australian broadcaster Clive James dies aged 80 Clive James obituary: 'A man of substance' On Barbara Cartland:""Twin miracles of mascara, her eyes looked like the corpses of two small crows that had crashed into a chalk cliff."" Glued to the Box On Philip Larkin:""[Larkin] himself is well aware that there are happier ways of viewing life. It's just that he is incapable of sharing them, except for fleeting moments - and the fleeting moments do not accumulate, whereas the times in between them do."" At the Pillars of Hercules, 1979 On Brezhnev - A Short Biography:""Here is a book so dull that a whirling dervish could read himself to sleep with it. If you were to recite even a single page in the open air, birds would fall out of the sky and dogs drop dead."" From the Land of Shadows, 1982 ""If Brideshead Revisited is not a great book, it's so like a great book that many of us, at least while reading it, find it hard to tell the difference."" Glued to the Box ""As for David Attenborough's Life On Earth, it was obvious from the first episode that thousands of new zoologists would all be conceived at once, like a population bulge. I watched enthralled, distracted only by envy of my own children, for whom knowledge was being brought to alive in a way that never happened for my generation or indeed any previous generation in all of history."" The Crystal Bucket ""In The Bob Hope Golf Classic (LWT) the participation of President Gerald Ford was more than enough to remind you that the nuclear button was at one stage at the disposal of a man who might have either pressed it by mistake or else pressed it deliberately in order to obtain room service."" Glued to the Box On The Lord of the Rings:""I still haven't forgiven CS Lewis for going on all those long walks with JRR Tolkien and failing to strangle him, thus to save us from hundreds of pages dripping with the wizardly wisdom of Gandalf and from the kind of movie in which Orlando Bloom defiantly flexes his delicate jaw at thousands of computer-generated orcs. In fact it would have been ever better if CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien could have strangled each other, so that we could also have been saved from the Chronicles of Narnia."" BBC Radio 4: A Point of View ""Spielberg had done his best with Schindler's List, but his best left some of us wondering just how useful a contribution it was, to make a movie about how some of the Jews had survived, when the real story was about all the Jews who hadn't."" BBC Radio 4: A Point of View On a South Bank Show interview with Harold Pinter:""It was exactly like getting blood from a stone, except that stones do not smoke. Pinter smoked all the time. You could tell that the interview was edited down from hours of film because in every shot Pinter had a fresh Balkan Sobranie in his hand. In the tight head-shots there was so much smoke pouring up from the bottom of the screen that you began wondering if his trousers were on fire.""

Islamists sentenced to death for 2016 cafe attack,"Eight people were put on trial accused of supplying weapons to the attackers Seven Islamists have been sentenced to death for a 2016 attack on a cafe in the Bangladeshi capital in which 22 people, mostly foreigners, were killed. The attack on the Holey Artisan cafe in Dhaka was carried out by a group of five men, who took diners hostage. Eight people were on trial, accused of planning the attack and supplying weapons. One man was acquitted. The 12-hour siege was Bangladesh's deadliest Islamist attack. Most of the victims were Italian or Japanese. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, but Bangladesh disputed this, instead holding a local militant group responsible. All of the gunmen were killed by police. Since the attack, Bangladesh authorities have led a brutal crackdown on militants it sees as a destabilising force in the predominantly Muslim country. Who were victims of Bangladesh cafe attack? 'I escaped death by reciting from the Koran' Bangladesh terror cafe reopens in new location Unanswered questions from the cafe siege Public prosecutor Golam Sarwar Khan, speaking after the verdict was delivered, said the charges against the accused ""were proved beyond any doubt"". ""The court gave them the highest punishment,"" the prosecutor told reporters. A defence lawyer said the seven men would appeal. Death sentences in Bangladesh are carried out by hanging. The wife of Robiul Islam, a policeman killed in the attack, said she hoped the death sentence would be carried out as soon as possible. ""In our society, it is really difficult for a widow to live with two kids. But I'll consider myself lucky because I've been showered with respect and support. My husband died for his country and is considered a martyr,"" Umme Salma told BBC Bengali. This video can not be played Bangladesh's terror attack cafe - three months on The seven convicted men were accused of belonging to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a home-grown Islamist group outlawed in the country. Sentencing the men in Dhaka, the judge said they wanted to undermine public safety and create anarchy. Some of the men shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (an Arabic phrase meaning ""God is greatest"") as they were led away from the packed courtroom, AFP news agency reported. A security cordon was put in place outside the court, with hundreds of armed police officers surrounding the building. One of thesuspected masterminds of the attack, Nurul Islam Marzan, was killed in a shootoutwith anti-terrorism police in January 2017, authorities said. On the evening of 1 July 2016, five gunmen burst into the Holey Artisan cafe in the upmarket Gulshan district of Dhaka. Armed with assault rifles and machetes, the young attackers opened fire and took diners hostage at gun-point. The attack saw victims inside the cafe, most of whom were foreigners, shot or hacked to death by the militants. This video can not be played A Dhaka resident captured the sound of gunshots during the raid Army commandos were called in after two police officers died trying to fight the militants. After a 12-hour stand-off, the commandos stormed the building and rescued 13 hostages, killing all five militants behind the attack. The casualties included nine Italians, seven Japanese, an American and an Indian. Family members and friends of the victims had gathered in the vicinity, anxiously waiting for news. The former location of Holey Artisan cafe, pictured here on the one year anniversary of the cafe attack Bangladesh Army Brig Gen Naim Asraf Chowdhury said the victims had been ""brutally"" attacked with sharp weapons. ""It was an extremely heinous act,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in a televised address at the time. ""What kind of Muslims are these people? They don't have any religion."" A police investigation found 21 militants in total were involved in carrying out and planning the attack, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Five were killed during the attack, eight in later anti-militant operations, the paper said. At least 80 suspected militants were killed and more than 300 people arrested during a wave of operations that followed the attack. Before that there had been a string of deadly attacks on secular writers, bloggers and members of religious minorities. Is Bangladesh winning the war against militants? Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Bangladesh arrests 900 in crackdown The Bangladeshi government repeatedly denied international jihadist groups, such as IS and al-Qaeda, were behind these attacks, usually blaming the JMB instead. Bangladeshi authorities have led a brutal crackdown on militants since the attack But security forces were subjected to intense criticism for failing to prevent the violence. The Holey Artisan cafe attack - claimed by IS - galvanised the country's security agencies into action. However there have been persistent worries over the authorities' tactics. The UN and others have accused the security forces of enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and use of torture. Analysis by Akbar Hossain, BBC Bengali, Dhaka The Holey Artisan cafe attack prompted massive anti-terror operations across the country. And there were huge human rights concerns over how the operations were conducted. The government claims it dismantled Islamist militant groups. The security forces and spy agencies in Bangladesh purchased sophisticated equipment to track militant activities over the internet. Security analysts recognise the government has successfully contained militancy - but it's not thought to have been completely uprooted. A recent picture released by the Islamic State group showed several young Bangladeshis expressing their support for the extremists' new leadership after US forces killed its former leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

James 'getting near the end',"Clive James says he is now ""a recluse"" after several years of serious illness. The Australian writer and broadcaster was diagnosed with leukaemia, kidney failure and lung disease in 2010. ""I've been really ill for two-and-a-half years,"" said the 72-year-old. ""I'm getting near the end. I'm a man who is approaching his terminus."" Yet James's comments to BBC Radio 4's

 have since been played down by his spokeswoman, who said he was ""in reasonable shape"". In the interview, to be broadcast in full on Saturday, James spoke at length about his health problems. This video can not be played Clive James: 'I'm getting near the end' ""I was diagnosed with leukaemia then I had COPD - which is a fancy name for emphysema - and my immune system packed up,"" he said. ""And that's just the start. ""I almost died four times and I swore to myself if I can just get through this winter, I'd feel better. ""And I got through the winter and here it is a lovely sunny day and guess what, I don't feel better."" Clive James moved to England in 1961, and rose to prominence as a literary critic and television columnist. He later became well-known for his TV work, including Clive James On Television and his commentary on programmes such as the Japanese gameshow Endurance. ""My tragedy now is that I'm so ill I can't get out so I'm a bit of a recluse,"" he said. ""I keep thinking of things I might have done better and remember the good times of course. ""But mainly I remember the errors. It's my nature, it makes me almost Â­impossible to live and work with."" James is married to academic Prue Shaw, with whom he has two children. The broadcaster says he is now worried he may never get to see his home country again. ""I've been so sick I'm not allowed to fly. ""You couldn't get enough oxygen aboard a plane to get me to Sydney. I used to be in Australia for five or six times a year but now I can't go. ""The wistfulness is really building up and I'm facing the possibility I might never see Sydney again."" Following the release of material from the programme, James's representative said the interview had ""sounded much less doom-laden than it does when transcribed"". ""Clive is in fact in reasonable shape and is looking forward to years of working, writing his books and his column for the [Daily] Telegraph."" <link>

Knifeman detained for railway station stab attacks,"This video can not be played Bodycam footage captured the moment police officers detained Mahdi Mohamud A man who tried to kill three people, including a police officer, in a frenzied knife attack at a railway station has been detained for life. Mahdi Mohamud, 26, stabbed a couple and then attacked Sgt Lee Valentine at Manchester Victoria on New Year's Eve. He was told he would serve a minimum of 11 years after admitting three counts of attempted murder and a terror offence at Manchester Crown Court. Mohamud will initially held in a high security psychiatric hospital. Sentencing, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith told Mohamud of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, he had ""walked calmly and purposefully to Manchester Victoria station"" where he spotted the couple. ""You followed them took out one of your knives and attacked them. You attacked them intending to kill them,"" the judge said. Mohamud stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head and slashed his partner across the face before attacking Sgt Valentine, who was trying to apprehend him. Mahdi Mohamud will be detained in Ashworth Secure Hospital and transferred to prison to when he is deemed well enough Mr Justice Stuart-Smith acknowledged Mohamud suffered from paranoid schizophrenia which led him to believe the government was controlling his body using ultra-high frequency waves. But he said although mental illness was a significant contribution to his interest in jihad, Mohamud retained substantial responsibility and culpability for the attacks. Mohamud will be detained in Ashworth Secure Hospital and transferred to prison to serve the rest of sentence when he is deemed well enough. This video can not be played Footage of the moment Mohamud struck at Manchester Victoria The court previously heard Mohamudwalked up behind the couple in their 50s at the station shortly before 21:00 GMT on 31 December. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Long live the caliphate"" and then lunged at them with a knife. The man's 13 injuries included a fractured skull while the woman's right lung was punctured and she had a slash to her forehead. Sgt Valentine, 31, shot Mohamud with his Taser but the barbs got stuck in the knifeman's coat and failed to paralyse him. The British Transport Police officer was stabbed in the shoulder before his attacker was wrestled to the ground and arrested. A second kitchen knife was found in Mohamud's waistband and Greater Manchester Police said officers recovered a large amount of ""counter-terrorism mindset material"", including images and a document about how to carry out knife attacks. Four officers, including Sgt Valentine (second left) and two tram staff, received commendations following the attack Mohamud, a Dutch national from a Somali family, had arrived in the UK aged nine and became radicalised online, the force said. Det Supt Will Chatterton said: ""This was a terrifying attack on one of the busiest days of the year and I know it will stay with the victims for the rest of their lives. ""It doesn't bear thinking about what could have happened had Mohamud used the larger knife that he was carrying in his coat pocket."" In a letter to the judge, Mohamud's father said the family had prayed for the victims since the ""horrific"" attack and said he was eternally grateful for the swift response from emergency services. He said the family was so ""shocked"" and ""deeply saddened"" knowing what his son had done but believed ""if it wasn't for Madhi's mental health illness he would not have done those awful acts"". Mohamud's solicitor, Nasir Hafezi, called for an urgent change to the law on insanity as it did not provide the ""legal protection required"" for a person suffering from a very serious mental health condition facing serious charges. ""Despite Mahdi pleading guilty... it would be wrong simply to label Mahdi in the same way as someone who has chosen to use violence in full possession of his mental faculties,"" he said.

Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film ban,"This video can not be played Rapman says he feels cheated following Vue's decision The director of a film at the centre of a storm over violence in cinemas has said he feels ""bullied"" and ""cheated"" after it was banned by the Vue chain. Rapman said Blue Story had nothing to do with a mass brawl involving machetes at a Vue in Birmingham, which left seven police officers injured. Vue pulled the British film, saying it had sparked 25 incidents nationwide. But Rapman said there ""was no link to Blue Story"" and asked whether there were ""hidden reasons"" behind the ban. Five teenagers were arrested after the fight in Birmingham's Star City complex on Saturday. The writer and director told BBC arts editor Will Gompertz: ""They were just in a cinema apparently for Frozen [2], but then they pinned it on Blue Story."" Vue said there had been a total of 25 ""significant incidents"" at its sites around the country, all involving people either watching, buying tickets for, going in to watch or leaving screenings of Blue Story. Rapman (centre) on the set of Blue Story Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, said there was ""no connection"" between the Birmingham brawl and his movie. ""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing? ""You start thinking of all these things, and it was an upsetting time."" A spokesperson for Vue said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race. 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Girl, 13, among 'machete' brawl cinema arrests Rapman: 'When I was at school, I focused on surviving' The rapper-turned-film-maker, who rose to prominence in 2017 with his hit YouTube series Shiro's Story, said taking a machete to a cinema was ""barbaric"", but asked Vue to give details of the other incidents. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""They say that there's been a number of incidents, but where's the proof? Where's the evidence? Where? ""We live in a camera generation now. If anything happens, the youth are going to film that and you will see it. How come we haven't seen any footage of the rest of these incidents? ""I feel like that was just something to say to cover their decision, which already wasn't justified because the [original] incident had no connection to Blue Story."" Vue founder and chief executive Tim Richards said incidents involving groups took place at 16 cinemas in total, starting on Friday morning - the day of Blue Story's release - until Saturday evening, when it was pulled. ""In over 30 years of working in cinema exhibition in the UK, I have never seen a nationwide issue like this affecting so many cinemas in such a short space of time,"" Mr Richards said. The chain classes ""significant incidents"" as those involving illegal activity, harassment, intimidation, violence, public disorder, or anything requiring security, medical, fire or police intervention. But Vue has not given specific details of the incidents or where they took place. ""We have reviewed and assessed each and every incident in detail as part of our ongoing process of making decisions as to how we could possibly keep Blue Story on our screens,"" Mr Richards said. Additional security was put in place, but ""we were still not satisfied the risk had been reduced to an acceptable level"", he added. Mr Richards also said Blue Story, which has a 15 certificate, attracted a ""very young audience"". Reports suggesting those involved in the incidents were there to watch other films - such as Frozen 2 - were ""simply not true"", he added. ""A younger audience were attempting to purchase tickets for other movies to access the Blue Story screenings and were also resisting requests for ID. This also played a key role in incidents and our decision."" This video can not be played Blue Story is the tale of two friends who become rivals West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""officers were attacked by quite young children"" in Birmingham on Saturday, including ""12, 13-year-olds who were there in quite large numbers"". His force had not asked the chain to pull screenings of the film, he added. ""But we have to ask why and how did so many young children turn up in such quite large numbers, some of them armed to attack other people. It's fortunate there wasn't any serious injury on Saturday, but my goodness there could have been."" The film is based on gangs in south London Rapman said he knew his film would appeal to young people, but he had no reason to suspect it might attract violence. ""The two gangs that the film's based on, which are real gangs, have been in a cinema screen watching it together, laughing together, joking together, and leaving a cinema connected, happy seeing the area they grew up in."" Blue Story follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham - two areas that have a notorious rivalry. It is released by the Paramount film studio, which offered to provide extra security at cinemas, Rapman said. The movie is also backed by BBC Films. ""Paramount have definitely offered every single site extra security if they need it. How hard would that be to just get more [security] people there?"" Showcase originally followed Vue's lead in pulling the film, but later reinstated it. Odeon and Cineworld have continued showing the movie. Vue's move has led to a vocal backlash, with some accusing the chain of being ""institutionally racist"". Vue has said its decision was made ""on grounds of safety alone"" and not because of ""biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself"". But Rapman said: ""They've alienated themselves from a big audience there. The explanation came with no evidence, no facts. ""I feel like they bullied me because I'm a small film. They wouldn't have pulled Frozen, they wouldn't have pulled Last Christmas. They pulled a little independent movie that needs it more than them other movies."" He feels ""cheated"" as a result, he added. ""I feel it's always the upward hurdles coming from our background. I always knew it was never going to be smooth. But the last thing I thought was a cinema would ban us from every single site. I just don't think they respect me. They don't respect my movie."" Rapman at the Blue Story premiere earlier this month Rapman said Blue Story is ""about what people do for the people they love, and how love can make people make the wrong decisions - and the right decisions sometimes"". He told BBC News: ""If you watch the film, you will understand. The last line of the whole trailer is, 'I'm not trying to justify, but I'm going to show you what these young boys are fighting for'. ""I'm not justifying their actions, but go and see why they are fighting, see why they're stabbing and see what they're doing all these things, just so you can see their motivation and maybe we can help prevent that, so they don't have to pick up a weapon again."" In his statement, Vue's Tim Richards added: ""We wholeheartedly agree that the issues that have arisen are not about the film, but neither are they about Vue. The chain screens more than 500 films a year ""in a range of diverse content"", he explained. ""We are in the business of showing movies, not withdrawing movies."" Blue Story opened on Friday 22 November on 310 screens in the UK and Ireland and made Â£1.3 million over the weekend. That was enough to secure it third place on this week's UK and Ireland box office chart, behind Frozen 2 and Last Christmas. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Obituary: Clive James,"Broadcaster, critic, poet, TV presenter and prolific author - Clive James cheerfully criss-crossed the boundaries between high and lowbrow. He was as much at home hosting a Shakespeare documentary as he was at fronting a programme showing people suffering indignities on Japanese TV. His sardonic tones graced a host of TV documentaries in which he brought his own acute observations to bear on a wide variety of subjects. A journalist on The Sydney Morning Herald once wrote: ""His gift and lasting contribution has been to recognise that mass appeal does not translate into lack of substance."" Australian broadcaster Clive James dies at 80 Clive James in his own words He was born Vivian James in Kogarah, south of Sydney, on 7 Oct 1939. He was later allowed to change his name when, according to his autobiography, Vivien Leigh's appearance in Gone With the Wind meant the name would forever be seen as female, no matter what the spelling. His father was captured by the Japanese during World War Two and forced to work as a slave labourer. He managed to survive internment but was killed when the plane returning him to Australia crashed in Taiwan. The young James studied psychology at the University of Sydney, where he also edited the student magazine and directed a number of revues. After graduating, he went to work as a journalist on the Sydney Morning Herald. In 1961 he set off for England, where for three years he led what he described as a ""would-be bohemian existence"" in London, working at a variety of jobs before gaining a place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where Germaine Greer was among his contemporaries. Clive James presented a BBC perspective on Shakespeare in 1980 He later confessed that he read very little of the course material, but did busy himself by writing for various periodicals, including The Listener and the Cambridge Review.  He became president of the Cambridge Footlights, and represented Pembroke on University Challenge. In 1972 he was commissioned by the Times Literary Supplement to write an appreciation of the noted writer and critic Edmund Wilson. His piece, published without a byline as was traditional at the TLS at the time, triggered a wave of speculation as to who had actually written it, and cemented James's reputation. He began a 10-year spell as a TV critic on The Observer, delivering a column that his fellow critic, Mark Lawson, once described as so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink. James with Michael Parkinson and Janet Street Porter in 1982 His strength was to write about the most banal television programmes in a high literary style, and he would often mix a critique of a serious documentary with comments on something more downmarket. His style would be widely copied by subsequent columnists. His job as a TV critic led to him being asked to make guest appearances on various programmes. One notable episode was on the Granada pop music programme So It Goes, when he found himself trying to keep a new band, The Sex Pistols, under control. ""One had grown used to pop performers dressing up in silly clothes and pretending to be horrible,"" he wrote in his column. ""But here were performers dressing up in silly clothes who really were horrible."" In 1982, ITV hired him to front a new show called Clive James on Television, which showed a series of amusing and offbeat TV clips from around the world. He was a prolific poet and author Excerpts from the Japanese programme, Endurance, became a regular feature. Contestants had to withstand unpleasant experiences such as being lowered into a tank full of insects, or being buried up to their necks in sand. James denied suggestions that he was being racist for highlighting a Japanese programme, explaining that he felt it was better that, if people were going to torment each other, they did it within the confines of a game show. He also fronted a travel programme, which transferred to the BBC in 1989 under the title Clive James's Postcard From. In 1993 the BBC broadcast his eight-part documentary series, Fame In The Twentieth Century, which used archive material to explore the nature of fame through each of the previous eight decades. The programme was also aired by ABC in Australia and PBS in the US. He was a regular voice on BBC Radio 4, and in 2008 he performed two one-man shows at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival. He also worked with songwriter and producer Pete Atkin on six musical albums during the 1970s, which were re-released on CD 20 years later, when the pair made a number of live performances. His television work did not distract him from writing. As well as publishing collections of poetry, he wrote four novels and five volumes of autobiography - the first of which, Unreliable Memoirs, was reprinted more than 60 times. He also published collections of his numerous essays and newspaper articles. In 1997 he penned a poignant piece for the New Yorker titled I Wish I'd Never Met Her, describing his reactions to the death of his friend, Diana, Princess of Wales. His illness failed to dampen his natural good humour He made a number of appearances on the BBC's Question Time and also appeared alongside Paul Merton on the satirical quiz Have I Got News For You. A lifetime of smoking and drinking culminated in a diagnosis of emphysema and kidney failure in 2010, and a year later he announced he had leukaemia. In a 2012 interview, he told BBC radio he was ""near the end"", saying: ""I don't want to cast a gloom, an air of doom, over the programme but I'm a man who is approaching his terminus."" Three years later, in an interview with the Guardian, he spoke of his ""embarrassment"" at still being alive, saying a new drug had kept the end at bay. This February, he had a long and ultimately unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek, which left him frail and almost blind. An atheist by conviction, James famously described religion as ""an advertising agency for a product that does not exist."" He was sanguine about his own end, maintaining a short biography on his website, which he hoped would be used as the basis for any appreciation of his life that might be written. Journalists writing an obituary should ""keep in mind that shorter is better, and that a single line is best"", it said. His life was much too full to fulfil that final wish.

Donald Trump and what comes next,"For any prime minister, handling a president like Donald Trump is like trying to hold on to a Ming vase walking across a recently polished, slippery parquet floor. He's a leader who glories in the unpredictable, who seems to wake up every morning wondering what controversy he can provoke, what headlines he can create. His reason for being is therefore from the start in contrast with the stiff choreography of a state visit. But No 10 will be relieved that the formalities with the PM today were free of mishap. And, as Theresa May readies herself for the exit, Donald Trump, who has definitely embarrassed her in the past, didn't repeat that habit today. Instead, he spoke warmly of her, suggesting that history may judge her much more kindly than the manner of her departure suggests. But some of the most notable remarks were not related to the prime minister in any case, but to what's next. Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts Whether you are overjoyed about Theresa May leaving or not, it is telling that the three names Donald Trump mentioned immediately when asked about the next leader were Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, and Michael Gove, categorising them deliberately or not as the three most likely candidates to win the keys to No 10. All three have been invited to meet Donald Trump. You wouldn't expect the US president to invite the football team of candidates for the job to spend time with him on this visit. But it's notable that neither Sajid Javid nor Matt Hancock - both cabinet contenders - received invites to talk or to meet. Nor did one of the other Brexiteer frontrunners, Dominic Raab. Of course, smart candidates could even turn the lack of invitation to their advantage. Donald Trump won't of course have a say in this race and he is such a Marmite politician that chumming up to him is not necessarily an advantage for any of the wannabes. But the invite list does tell us something about the state of the race right now. And in the next 24 hours we'll see whom, beyond Nigel Farage, the president actually meets one-on-one. The other striking note was not about Theresa May either, even though, as her last big appearance alongside a foreign leader it was, in a way, a very grand leaving do. Instead, it was the Labour leader who featured. It's not exactly surprising that the two men would not be bosom buddies. Politically they have a greater distance between them than the width of the Atlantic. Mr Trump revealed not just (no real surprise) that he doesn't think much of Jeremy Corbyn, apt when Jeremy Corbyn doesn't think much of him either. He also revealed that Mr Corbyn had asked him to meet and that he, after considering his request, had decided not to do so. The Labour leader has always said that he is interested in dialogue. But his position does appear rather curious. Mr Corbyn chose very publicly not to attend the dinner for Mr Trump last night at the Queen's invitiation. He then led - very publicly - the protests against the president today. Yet we now know that he had actually asked for a meeting of his own, but was then rebuffed. Diplomacy, or the lack of it, can be a complicated business. We've learnt that from observing Donald Trump and Theresa May over the last few years. But those pitfalls won't disappear when the prime minister does. Now Jeremy Corbyn and the contenders for the Tory crown are all too aware of that.

UK would be 'outgunned' in Russia conflict,"British ground forces would be ""comprehensively outgunned"" in a conflict with Russia in Eastern Europe, according to a defence think-tank. Research by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) found that the Army, as well as Nato allies, has a ""critical shortage"" of artillery and ammunition. It concluded that it could not maintain a credible defence position. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK works closely with Nato and is ""well equipped to take on a leading role"". The research comes ahead of a meeting of Nato leaders in London next week to mark the 70th anniversary of the alliance. The UK, along with other Nato members, has positioned military forces in Eastern Europe to deter any potential Russian aggression in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Around 800 British troops arecurrently stationed in Estonia. The first were sent in 2017. Nato alliance is brain dead, says Macron Strength of British military falls for ninth year MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' But the study by Rusi found that the UK armed forces lack critical firepower compared to Russia's military. It analysed military capabilities in the ""unlikely"" context of ""a high-intensity conflict between Nato and Russia, in which the UK has promised to deliver a warfighting division"". ""At present, there is a risk that the UK - unable to credibly fight - can be dominated lower down the escalation ladder by powers threatening escalation,"" the report said. It said Britain is ""comprehensively outgunned and outranged"", leaving enemy artillery free to defeat UK units. Russian artillery and rocket batteries have already proved to be potent, destroying two Ukrainian battalions in 2014 within minutes. UK and other Nato forces not only have a limited number of artillery pieces, but also a shortage of munitions stockpiles and transportation. The report said the ""rejuvenation and modernisation"" of Britain's ground-based artillery is an ""urgent and critical priority"". In response, the MoD said: ""The UK does not stand alone but alongside its Nato Allies, who work closely together across air, sea, land, nuclear and cyber to deter threats and respond to crises."" It added: ""As the largest Nato defence spender in Europe, the UK's armed forces are well equipped to take a leading role in countering threats and ensuring the safety and security of British people at home and abroad."" The statement comes less than three weeks after French President Emmanuel Macrondescribed Nato as ""brain dead""- stressing what he sees as waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor, the US.

"UK would be 'outgunned' in Russia conflictThe UK has a critical shortage of artillery and ammunition, according to a defence think-tank.","British ground forces would be ""comprehensively outgunned"" in a conflict with Russia in Eastern Europe, according to a defence think-tank. Research by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) found that the Army, as well as Nato allies, has a ""critical shortage"" of artillery and ammunition. It concluded that it could not maintain a credible defence position. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK works closely with Nato and is ""well equipped to take on a leading role"". The research comes ahead of a meeting of Nato leaders in London next week to mark the 70th anniversary of the alliance. The UK, along with other Nato members, has positioned military forces in Eastern Europe to deter any potential Russian aggression in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Around 800 British troops arecurrently stationed in Estonia. The first were sent in 2017. Nato alliance is brain dead, says Macron Strength of British military falls for ninth year MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' But the study by Rusi found that the UK armed forces lack critical firepower compared to Russia's military. It analysed military capabilities in the ""unlikely"" context of ""a high-intensity conflict between Nato and Russia, in which the UK has promised to deliver a warfighting division"". ""At present, there is a risk that the UK - unable to credibly fight - can be dominated lower down the escalation ladder by powers threatening escalation,"" the report said. It said Britain is ""comprehensively outgunned and outranged"", leaving enemy artillery free to defeat UK units. Russian artillery and rocket batteries have already proved to be potent, destroying two Ukrainian battalions in 2014 within minutes. UK and other Nato forces not only have a limited number of artillery pieces, but also a shortage of munitions stockpiles and transportation. The report said the ""rejuvenation and modernisation"" of Britain's ground-based artillery is an ""urgent and critical priority"". In response, the MoD said: ""The UK does not stand alone but alongside its Nato Allies, who work closely together across air, sea, land, nuclear and cyber to deter threats and respond to crises."" It added: ""As the largest Nato defence spender in Europe, the UK's armed forces are well equipped to take a leading role in countering threats and ensuring the safety and security of British people at home and abroad."" The statement comes less than three weeks after French President Emmanuel Macrondescribed Nato as ""brain dead""- stressing what he sees as waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor, the US. MoD figures released in August found that the size of Britain's armed forceshad fallen for a ninth consecutive year. The finding came just six months after the Commons spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, claimed theMoD had a funding black hole of at least Â£7bnin its 10-year plan to equip the UK's armed forces.

Mother heard son's 'horrific scream' during attack,"Paul Smith was on the phone to his mother when he was targeted A mother was on the phone to her son when he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him to death with a pair of scissors, a court has heard. IT analyst Paul Smith, 28, was attacked by George McAdam near Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh in May. A court heard McAdam had only been freed from prison two weeks earlier. Prosecutors accepted his not guilty plea on the basis he ""lacked criminal responsibility"" at the time of the attack due to a mental disorder. McAdam was formally acquitted at the High Court in Glasgow. The court heard Mr Smith had been returning to work at Edinburgh University when he wasattacked by McAdamand stabbed 32 times. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said: ""He was still chatting to his mother by telephone. ""She then describes hearing 'a horrific scream'. She heard her son saying: 'Help me... need police, need police."" Margaret immediately yelled to her husband Ian to dial 999. But Mr Smith did not survive the attack, which happened close to Edinburgh Castle. Police sealed off the scene in Johnston Terrace after the attack in May The court heard McAdam, 40, initially fled the scene but was rugby tackled by a passer-by in a nearby car park. McAdam, who had faced a murder charge, will remain at the State Hospital at Carstairs. The court heard he had been sleeping rough in Edinburgh at the time. McAdam had a lengthy list of convictions in Scotland and England, including for possession of a knife and assault. He had been freed from HMP Edinburgh on 15 May, just over a fortnight before the fatal attack. Mr Smith, of Balerno, was attacked at about 13:45 on 30 May, after visiting a KFC restaurant for lunch. Paul Smith was returning to his work in Edinburgh at the time of the attack Prosecutor, Ms Edwards told the court: ""His mum immediately told her husband to call police as their son needed help. ""She stayed on the phone to her son."" The court heard McAdam had grabbed Mr Smith, who tried to defend himself. Ms Edwards said: ""McAdam repeatedly stabbed him in the chest area. ""Paul Smith shouted 'he's stabbed me' and fell to the ground."" McAdam then dragged Mr Smith down a steep embankment while continuing the attack. The court heard he knelt beside his victim and struck him multiple times on the body and neck. Members of the public heard Mr Smith's cries for help but the court was told McAdam appeared ""oblivious"" to a crowd that was gathering. McAdam eventually ran off but was tracked to a nearby NCP car park. Police and paramedics spent more than 30 minutes trying to save Mr Smith, but Ms Edwards added: ""His injuries would not have been survivable even with medical intervention."" The court heard McAdam was later seen by psychiatrists and was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Lord Turnbull ordered him to remain at Carstairs on an interim compulsion order. The case will call again in February.

'We will sit in Black Friday shopper queue for you',"Alexis Granados and her husband A US couple is offering to camp out all night and hold places in the shopping queue for those who want to splurge on Black Friday deals. ""My husband has great ways of thinking when it comes to money,"" says Alexis Granados, of her partner Steven Velasquez. He recently lost his job as a scale operator for a recycling company. The pair are charging $50 (Â£38) each to wait outside any store in Upland, California, the night before the Black Friday sales. Being paid to queue is not new - but part of a growing phenomenon within what iscommonly known as the gig economy. On Task Rabbit and Bidvine, UK sites that advertise services from the self-employed, people can earn between Â£15 and Â£20 a time. Meanwhile, Placer, an app available in the US has been created solely to cater for people who are too busy to queue and willing to pay others to do it for them. An estimated 165.3 million people are expected to hit the shops in the US between Friday and Monday, the National Retail Federation says. The shopping bonanza, which originated in America, falls on the Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday - when workers in the US usually have the day off. And the California-based Granados couple say the work will help them to make ends meet. They are looking for more traditional jobs, but in the meantime say they're happy to pick up odd jobs where they can. Neither have done anything like this before, but she says ""I'm pretty sure it won't be our last time. It's actually easy money when you think about it"". The couple have a car, where they can warm up during their queuing time. They are advertising their queuing service on social media and several people have expressed an interest.  The duo guarantee a good place in the queue and if their customer is not satisfied they say they will not charge for the service. ""We used to be homeless, so it is not really a pain for us,"" says Ms Granados, saying the money means a lot to them. Currently the young couple, who are in their 20s, have a housing voucher that helped them get off the street.   ""It was actually a stepping stone for us and helped us grow as adults,"" says Ms Granados. Housing assistance in the US is offered to people with incomes under a certain threshold who need help finding a place to live. With a housing voucher, people can secure a place in social housing.

A simple guide to the election,"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

'Proof NHS at risk under US trade deal' - Labour,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This election is now a fight for survival of NHS"" A row has broken out after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed he had ""proof"" the NHS was at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Mr Corbyn said he had a 451-page dossier showing initial talks had taken place, proving the NHS was ""for sale"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claims were ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. The Tory manifesto explicitly states neither the price paid for drugs nor NHS services will be ""on the table"". Meanwhilethe SNP has published its manifestowhich includes a pledge to ""stop the NHS becoming a lever in any international trade deal"" through its NHS Protection Act. And other parties have criticised the Tories, including Liberal Democrat shadow Brexit secretary Tom Brake, who said the public would be ""horrified by what looks like a deal cooked up between the Tories and Donald Trump that puts our NHS on the table"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Reality Check: Five things from the leaked trade papers What we learned from the leaked US trade documents Jeremy Corbyn interview fact-checked Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said the Conservative Party ""can no longer claim the NHS is not for sale"", adding: ""Under their watch, it is."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn's 451 page NHS dossier is a ""diversionary tactic"" Mark Dayan, policy analyst and the head of public affairs at the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was not being ""flogged off"" in the sense that US companies will not own hospitals. But he said the documents suggest the US is trying various tactics to get the NHS to pay more money to their pharmaceutical companies for the drugs that they sell. ""Obviously from the NHS's point of view, that is a concern... you're really losing out in that situation,"" he said. Mr Dayan said if talks with the US continue, UK negotiators must ""push hard for the interests of the UK and the NHS"". This video can not be played Barry Gardiner and Andrew Neil on Labour claims about UK-US talks about the UK market for buying drugs. Labour obtained uncensored government documents covering six rounds of talks between US and UK officials in Washington and London between July 2017 and July 2019. They are all preparatory meetings ahead of formal trade talks. These documents provide more detail on the meetingsChannel 4's Dispatches programme reported,externalon last month. They show the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly, extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used. One document quotes a UK official saying the talks are helpful in determining the areas the US may want to discuss, while acknowledging the UK would have objections. As well as the pharmaceutical industry, the talks also covered other areas including agriculture and climate change. The UK team inquired about including a reference to climate change in any US-UK trade deal, something the US side said was not allowed by Congress. The document also refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks - but says it is up to other countries to specify anything they want to be excluded from talks. There is no indication in the documents that the UK team agreed to anything in the talks. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't provide evidence ministers have agreed the health service should be part of a trade deal with US. But details of discussions about the demands of US pharmaceutical companies will still be motivating for Labour voters worried about the NHS. ""Not for sale,"" has been the biggest mantra at Labour events, even though the Tories have always furiously denied the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". It's clear US drug companies want access to UK markets - Labour suggests the UK has agreed they could extend the patents on some medicines, which could cost the NHS more, for example. But whether any UK government would ever do a deal that made medicines much more expensive for the NHS, and therefore the taxpayer, which would be massively costly for the government and probably prove deeply unpopular, is a big political question. The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Currently, the NHS is able to use its bargaining power as a centralised health system to negotiate low prices for drugs. It also has a strong track record in resisting attempts to lengthen patents on drugs, to allow cheaper generics to be used more quickly than they are in the US. The US currently pays two and a half times more for drugs than the NHS does. Meanwhile, about 7% of the NHS budget in England goes on private companies that provide NHS services, mainly non-emergency treatments such as knee and hip replacements and some community services. And Labour has warned this market could be extended further under the Tories. Mr Corbyn said the documents showed talks were at a ""very advanced stage"" and gave the lie to Boris Johnson's claims the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. ""The uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters,"" he told a news conference in London. ""We have now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. ""He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda and today it has been exposed."" Reacting to Mr Corbyn's latest claims, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was simply a stunt. ""Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out and out lying about what the documents contain. ""People should not believe what he says."" Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said the claims were ""total nonsense"". ""This is continually brought up by the Labour Party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering,"" he said. And he could give an ""absolute cast iron guarantee"" the NHS would not be on the table. He also pointed out the documents had been available online for two months.

"SNP vote 'will send clear message on indyref2'Nicola Sturgeon says a vote for the SNP will be a vote to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"".Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Nicola Sturgeon has launched the SNP election manifesto with a pledge to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". The manifesto says that the SNP winning the most seats in Scotland would send a ""clear"" message that an independence referendum must be held next year. Ms Sturgeon said the country faced a ""fundamental question"" over who should decide its future. And she called for a big increase in NHS funding across the UK. The SNP won 35 seats at the last general election in 2017, making it the third biggest party in the UK Parliament, and it hopes to hold the balance of power if there is a hung parliament after the forthcoming election. Ms Sturgeon says she is open to forming a ""progressive alliance"" with other parties after the election, but has ruled out doing a deal with the Conservatives or entering into a formal coalition with Labour. SNP manifesto: Key policies explained Read the full SNP manifesto,external Among the key pledges in the party's election manifesto are: A second referendum on Scottish independence next year Another referendum on EU membership, or the revocation of Article 50 if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit To call on the UK government to match Scottish per capita NHS spending, which will also deliver increased funding for Scotland Demand an end to austerity and press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy To call for the UK government to devolve powers over drug policy to the Scottish Parliament To press for the devolution of employment law To also seek the devolution of immigration powers so that Scotland can have a ""migration system that works for our economy and society"" Scrap the UK's Trident nuclear missile system An additional 12 weeks of parental leave which would be ring fenced for fathers to take A proposal for a NHS Protection Act to guarantee that the health service will not be used as a ""bargaining trip"" in future trade deals A plan to ring-fence oil and gas revenues to pay for climate change measures. At-a-glance: The SNP manifesto Ms Sturgeon accused the main Westminster parties of delivering ""constant chaos"" since the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scottish voters choose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. And she claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""dangerous and unfit for office"" and that his proposed Brexit deal would be a ""nightmare"" for Scotland. This video can not be played General election 2019: What's in the SNP's manifesto? She told the manifesto launch event in Glasgow: ""A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, It is a vote to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands, and it is a vote to deprive Boris Johnson's Conservative Party of a majority. ""The reality of Westminster control over Scotland is this: a right-wing Tory government Scotland didn't vote for and a prime minister in Boris Johnson who is dangerous and unfit for office."" Mr Johnson has alreadyruled out granting the formal consentthat Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says would be needed to ensure any independence referendum was legal. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would oppose a referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - but the party says it would not oppose one if there is a pro-independence majority after the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. But Ms Sturgeon said the decision on if and when a referendum is held should be one for the ""people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament"". She added: ""The democratically-elected Scottish Parliament has agreed the people should be given a choice over their future. An unelected Tory Westminster government has no right to overturn that decision. ""So an SNP victory in this election would be a clear instruction from the people of Scotland to respect Scottish democracy. ""There must be no Westminster veto over the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" Boris Johnson has given a ""cast iron guarantee"" that he would reject any request for consent to hold indyref2 if he wins the election And despite Mr Johnson's campaign pledge to ""get Brexit done"", Ms Sturgeon warned it was ""nowhere near done"" and predicted that Brexit would dominate Westminster politics for years to come. She said: ""The Tories have barely got going - they haven't even started trade talks. Because of Johnson's hard line position, there is every chance the UK will leave without a trade deal next year. That would be a catastrophe for jobs. ""And even if he somehow avoids that, his dream deal will be a nightmare for Scotland. ""It will take Scotland out of the single market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - and out of the Customs Union, the world's biggest trading block."" The SNP are not pretending that there is any chance they could form a government in Westminster, no matter how many seats they win. So Nicola Sturgeon admits these manifesto pledges can only be met if this election produces a hung parliament, if Labour are the largest party, if the SNP hold the balance of power, and if they can agree a deal with Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Sturgeon has already ruled out a formal coalition with Labour, saying she favours a ""progressive alliance"" with like-minded parties. In those circumstances the most important ask for Nicola Sturgeon is getting Mr Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum. Without that, any kind of deal would be unthinkable. Read more from Sarah here Ms Sturgeon also unveiled further details of the demands the SNP would make in return for supporting Labour if there is a hung parliament. The party says that central to this will be proposals to significantly increase funding for the NHS across the UK - with the SNP saying it is proposing more substantial funding increases than any other major party in the election. The SNP will demand that the next UK government raises per-head health spending south of the border to levels seen in Scotland. The party says spending is currently Â£136 per head higher north of the border, and that such a move would see NHS resource funding in England increase by more than Â£35bn between 2019/20 and 2023/24. This would also mean an additional Â£4bn in Barnett consequential for the Scottish NHS.

The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. Trident:The Conservatives say they will maintain the Trident nuclear deterrent. The Liberal Democrats support maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent with leader Jo Swinson making clear she would be prepared to deploy Trident if she was prime minister. Labour supports the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent but also said it would lead multilateral efforts to achieve a nuclear-free world under the non-proliferation treaty. Scottish independence:Labour opposes Scottish independence but has said a Labour-run UK government would agree to another referendum if pro-yes parties win a majority at the next Holyrood election in 2021. The Conservatives are opposed to a second independence referendum with Boris Johnson claiming he could ""guarantee"" there will not be a second vote if the Conservatives win the general election.

Intruder hunted over sex attack on boy in bedroom,"Police want to trace this man who was seen running from the area after the assault A CCTV image of a man suspected of sexually assaulting a young boy in his bedroom has been issued by detectives. The Met Police was called to a home in The Greenway in Ickenham, west London, early on Saturday morning to reports an intruder had been inside the property. Officers said there was no sign of a break-in at the property but the man made his way into the boy's room and sexually assaulted him. The man fled when the child told him he would phone the police. Detectives described the suspect as white, slim, with short hair and a beard. He was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. The child, whose age has not been given in order to protect his identity, is being supported by specially trained officers. Police have released the image of a man they want to trace and asked for anyone who recognises the man, or who was in the area after midnight on Saturday, to contact the Met. No arrests have been made. Det Con Claire Field said: ""This matter has clearly caused a great deal of anguish to the boy's family. ""Police are very concerned and we are carrying out an extensive and well-resourced investigation. ""We are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who was seen running from the area shortly after the assault. It is vital that we speak to him to establish why he was in the vicinity.""

US to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorists,"Three women and six children died in an attack in northern Mexico earlier this month The US will legally designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, President Donald Trump says. The move would enable a wider scope of US action. Mr Trump also said he had told Mexico the US was ready to ""go in and clear out"" the cartels. In response Mexico's foreign minister said his country would not allow any ""violation of national sovereignty"". Earlier this month Mr Trump vowed to ""wage war on the drug cartels"" after a deadly attack on US citizens in Mexico. The victims - three women and six children who were Mormons of dual US-Mexican nationality - were killed in an ambush while travelling through a remote area of northern Mexico on 4 November. How a US Mormon family ended up dead in Mexico First funerals held for Mexico ambush victims How dangerous is Mexico? Officials said it may have been a case of mistaken identity, but relatives of the victims said the killers must have known whom they were targeting. After the attackthe victims' community, the LeBarons, petitioned the White House to list the cartels as terror groups,external, saying: ""They are terrorists and it's time to acknowledge it."" This video can not be played President Trump tells Bill O'Reilly about his plan to designate cartels as terror groups Conservative media figure Bill O'Reilly asked President Trump on Tuesday whether he was going to designate the cartels as terror groups and ""start hitting them with drones"". The president said: ""They will be designated... I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process."" He added that he had told Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador that the US was willing to launch operations against the cartels inside Mexico. ""I've already offered him to let us go in and clean it out and he so far has rejected the offer but at some point something has to be done,"" Mr Trump said. When a group is designated as a terrorist organisation in the US, it becomes illegal for people in the US to knowingly offer support. Its members are also banned from entering the US. If they are already in the US, they face being deported. Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels 'I spent eight months working for a drug cartel' Drug lord 'El Chapo' found guilty in US If financial institutions discover they have funds connected to the group, they are required to block the money and alert the US Treasury Department. Some analysts suggest that the designation could affect the supply of weapons to the cartels from the US. This video can not be played Three ways the US is influencing violence in Mexico Earlier this yeara US government study traced more than 150,000 firearms,externalincluding assault rifles back from Mexican criminals to gun shops and factories in the US. Under anti-terror laws, those who purchase the guns in the US for the cartels could face much heavier penalties. Other analysts suggest such a designation could complicate possible Mexican government negotiations with cartels as well as efforts by US agencies and NGOs to support peace moves. Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico had made clear to the US its rejection of any violation of its sovereignty. He also said Mexico was committed to tackling transnational organised crime. ""Mutual respect is the basis for cooperation,"" Mr Ebrard said. A foreign ministry statement said Mr Ebrard would discuss the issue with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. This video can not be played In October Sinaloa cartel gunmen overpowered Mexican security forces in the city of CuliacÃ¡n Mexico wants measures to reduce the flow of weapons and money from the US to the cartels as well as efforts to stop the movement of drugs across its territory towards the US, the statement said. On Monday Mr LÃ³pez Obrador told journalists Mexico would not accept foreign intervention against the cartels. ""Our problems will be solved by Mexicans. We don't want any interference from any foreign country,"" he said. Mexico's brutal drug war claims tens of thousands of lives every year, as powerful trafficking groups battle for territory and influence. In 2017 more than 30,000 people were killed in the country, with the murder rate having more than tripled since 2006. The cartels control vast areas and are also responsible for political corruption, assassinations and kidnappings. Earlier this weekat least 13 police officers were killed in an ambush in the western state of MichoacÃ¡n. The attack is believed to have been carried out by the Jalisco New Generation cartel. This video can not be played Mexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide? In a now-notorious incident in October, hundreds of gunmen from the Sinaloa cartel overpowered security forces in the Sinaloa state capital CuliacÃ¡n, taking troops hostage and eventually forcing the government to release a captured cartel leader Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n. President LÃ³pez Obrador has opted for a non-confrontational approach to the cartels, instead making tackling inequality central to his efforts under a policy dubbed ""abrazos, no balazos"" - hugs not bullets. But this policy has come in for criticism after Mexican security forces were so comprehensively outgunned in CuliacÃ¡n. The US government has described the Sinaloa Cartel as one of the largest drug-trafficking organisations in the world. In Julyits former leader JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n was sentenced to life in prisonfollowing one of the most high-profile trials in recent US history. But the group continues to make billions of dollars from trafficking illicit narcotics to the US, Europe and Asia, experts say. Meanwhile the Jalisco cartel is believed to have assets worth more than $20bn (Â£15.5bn) and is one of the main distributors of synthetic drugs on the continent, the US says. It has gained notoriety for attacks on security forces and public officials, including the downing of an army helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade.

SNP launch election manifesto,"This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Nicola Sturgeon has launched the SNP election manifesto with a pledge to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". The manifesto says that the SNP winning the most seats in Scotland would send a ""clear"" message that an independence referendum must be held next year. Ms Sturgeon said the country faced a ""fundamental question"" over who should decide its future. And she called for a big increase in NHS funding across the UK. The SNP won 35 seats at the last general election in 2017, making it the third biggest party in the UK Parliament, and it hopes to hold the balance of power if there is a hung parliament after the forthcoming election. Ms Sturgeon says she is open to forming a ""progressive alliance"" with other parties after the election, but has ruled out doing a deal with the Conservatives or entering into a formal coalition with Labour. SNP manifesto: Key policies explained Read the full SNP manifesto,external Among the key pledges in the party's election manifesto are: A second referendum on Scottish independence next year Another referendum on EU membership, or the revocation of Article 50 if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit To call on the UK government to match Scottish per capita NHS spending, which will also deliver increased funding for Scotland Demand an end to austerity and press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy To call for the UK government to devolve powers over drug policy to the Scottish Parliament To press for the devolution of employment law To also seek the devolution of immigration powers so that Scotland can have a ""migration system that works for our economy and society"" Scrap the UK's Trident nuclear missile system An additional 12 weeks of parental leave which would be ring fenced for fathers to take A proposal for a NHS Protection Act to guarantee that the health service will not be used as a ""bargaining trip"" in future trade deals A plan to ring-fence oil and gas revenues to pay for climate change measures. At-a-glance: The SNP manifesto Ms Sturgeon accused the main Westminster parties of delivering ""constant chaos"" since the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scottish voters choose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. And she claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""dangerous and unfit for office"" and that his proposed Brexit deal would be a ""nightmare"" for Scotland. This video can not be played General election 2019: What's in the SNP's manifesto? She told the manifesto launch event in Glasgow: ""A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, It is a vote to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands, and it is a vote to deprive Boris Johnson's Conservative Party of a majority. ""The reality of Westminster control over Scotland is this: a right-wing Tory government Scotland didn't vote for and a prime minister in Boris Johnson who is dangerous and unfit for office."" Mr Johnson has alreadyruled out granting the formal consentthat Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says would be needed to ensure any independence referendum was legal. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would oppose a referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - but the party says it would not oppose one if there is a pro-independence majority after the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. But Ms Sturgeon said the decision on if and when a referendum is held should be one for the ""people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament"". She added: ""The democratically-elected Scottish Parliament has agreed the people should be given a choice over their future. An unelected Tory Westminster government has no right to overturn that decision. ""So an SNP victory in this election would be a clear instruction from the people of Scotland to respect Scottish democracy. ""There must be no Westminster veto over the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" Boris Johnson has given a ""cast iron guarantee"" that he would reject any request for consent to hold indyref2 if he wins the election And despite Mr Johnson's campaign pledge to ""get Brexit done"", Ms Sturgeon warned it was ""nowhere near done"" and predicted that Brexit would dominate Westminster politics for years to come. She said: ""The Tories have barely got going - they haven't even started trade talks. Because of Johnson's hard line position, there is every chance the UK will leave without a trade deal next year. That would be a catastrophe for jobs. ""And even if he somehow avoids that, his dream deal will be a nightmare for Scotland. ""It will take Scotland out of the single market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - and out of the Customs Union, the world's biggest trading block."" The SNP are not pretending that there is any chance they could form a government in Westminster, no matter how many seats they win. So Nicola Sturgeon admits these manifesto pledges can only be met if this election produces a hung parliament, if Labour are the largest party, if the SNP hold the balance of power, and if they can agree a deal with Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Sturgeon has already ruled out a formal coalition with Labour, saying she favours a ""progressive alliance"" with like-minded parties. In those circumstances the most important ask for Nicola Sturgeon is getting Mr Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum. Without that, any kind of deal would be unthinkable. Read more from Sarah here Ms Sturgeon also unveiled further details of the demands the SNP would make in return for supporting Labour if there is a hung parliament. The party says that central to this will be proposals to significantly increase funding for the NHS across the UK - with the SNP saying it is proposing more substantial funding increases than any other major party in the election. The SNP will demand that the next UK government raises per-head health spending south of the border to levels seen in Scotland. The party says spending is currently Â£136 per head higher north of the border, and that such a move would see NHS resource funding in England increase by more than Â£35bn between 2019/20 and 2023/24. This would also mean an additional Â£4bn in Barnett consequential for the Scottish NHS.

Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote.

The Liberal Democrats support maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent with leader Jo Swinson making clear she would be prepared to deploy Trident if she was prime minister.

SNP manifesto: Key policies explained,"The SNP has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan ""Stronger for Scotland"". It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce. Thefull document runs to 52 pages,external. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day,12 December? Keep Scotland in the EU by supporting a second Brexit referendum with Remain on the ballot paper. About a third of Scotland's million Leave voters at the Brexit referendum in 2016 were also supporters of Scottish independence. However, Nicola Sturgeon has come down firmly in favour of the UK remaining within the EU, or re-joining it if Scotland becomes independent. At Westminster, the party's MPs have backed moves towards another Brexit referendum, so long as Remain is an option on the ballot paper. That continues to be the position in the current election's manifesto. If it comes to a choice for MPs between revoking Brexit and ""no deal"" with the European Union, the SNP says it would back revocation. In addition, Brexit is seen by the SNP as such a big change to the UK constitution that it warrants another vote on Scottish independence, or indyref2 as it has been dubbed. Even if Brexit is thrown into reverse the SNP will still use any leverage it has after this election to secure indyref2, arguing that the Brexit ""chaos"" will continue for years. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Ask the UK government to give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum next year on independence. Precisely nobody will be surprised to see support for an independence referendum in the SNP manifesto. To be clear, the party already believes it has several mandates for a new poll, but hopes that a big win on 12 December will really cement its case. This is because the big question about indyref2 is how it comes about. Nicola Sturgeon wants an agreement with the UK government before holding a vote, but has seen theConservatives rule this out completely,externalandLabour say it wouldn't be on the table in the ""early years"" of a new government.,external If Ms Sturgeon is to get a referendum on her 2020 timetable, something needs to give - and she wants the result of this election to send a big message to both potential prime ministers about ""Scotland's future being in Scotland's hands"". The constitution is reserved to Westminster. Can Nicola Sturgeon deliver Scottish independence? Demand that the UK government raise health spending in the UK to match health spending in Scotland. Health is a devolved issue meaning spending and policy are decisions for the Scottish government. The SNP has been in power in Scotland for a more than decade andhas been under scrutiny over its domestic record. But that doesn't stop the SNP wanting to influence what happens at Westminster. Scotland spends more per head on health than any other part of the UK. This is partly to support rural services, but historically Scotland has faced a number of public health challenges. The SNP says to get its support in the event of a hung parliament, spending on the NHS across the UK needs to increase by billions of pounds. Pushing up spending per head in the UK to the same level as Scotland would then give a further boost to the block grant from the Treasury to Holyrood. That would mean health spending in Scotland would remain proportionally higher than the rest of the UK. Health is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy. The SNP could not form a majority government, so there's no costed budget with this manifesto. That will be for the Holyrood elections in May 2021. So there are demands for additional spending, without making clear the source of these funds. The big ask of the next chancellor is to reverse the spending squeeze over the past decade. There's a claim in the manifesto that deficit reduction measures by the Treasury have led to Â£13.9bn less spending on public services in Scotland (between 2010-2011 and 2019-2020) than would otherwise have been the case. While the Conservatives plan to increase the level at which employees start to pay National Insurance, the SNP wants both to freeze that level and to devolve power over that system, so that it can be integrated with Holyrood's income tax powers. The other big tax-and-spend change would be to take the Â£8.5bn in tax revenue projected (by the Office for Budget Responsibility) over five years from UK offshore oil and gas, and to apply it to a ""net zero fund"", to help the transition of energy use. That is a change from past SNP spending plans, which looked to oil and gas revenue to fund public services. Most taxes are decided by Westminster, including National Insurance. Get rid of the UK's nuclear deterrent and spend the money on public services. The SNP has long called for the removal of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines from Scottish waters. Nicola Sturgeonhas recently stated it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government. Jeremy Corbyn, too, has long been an opponent of nuclear weapons, but official Labour Party policy(restated in its manifesto),external- like that of the Conservatives - is to support the renewal of Trident. The Liberal Democrats say they'd keep Trident but reduce the nuclear posture of round-the-clock patrols with three instead of four submarines. The trouble is that the Westminster Parliament has already given the green light to build four new submarines to carry the Trident missiles at a cost of Â£35bn. That work is already well under way. The SNP still believes scrapping Trident would free up tens of billions of pounds to strengthen conventional forces and to spend on hospitals and schools. But critics of the SNP position warn that scrapping Trident would hit the local economy on the Clyde where the submarines are based. They also argue it could jeopardise Britain's position as a recognised nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council. Defence is a reserved power of Westminster. Introduce a bill to protect the health service from privatisation and future trade deals. The future of the NHS - and its part in any post-Brexit trade deals - has already been a major battleground in this election. Although the Scottish government is responsible for running the health service in Scotland, there have been concerns that after Brexit, trade negotiations between the UK and US could lead to American companies bidding for contracts and pushing up the cost of drugs. The SNP's NHS Protection Act would enshrine in law that the NHS is protected as publicly-owned and operated with its services publicly commissioned. The SNP says it will stop the health service becoming a lever in any kind of international trade deal. Crucially the legislation says any trade deal would require the consent of all the devolved parliaments and assemblies to ensure it did not impact on the health service. However, the Conservatives have strongly denied the NHS would ever be used as a bargaining tool. Expect to hear more about it during the campaign. Trade is a reserved power, however the government has pledged to involve devolved powers in talks. Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Sturgeon announces plans for NHS protection bill CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external Devolve drug classification powers to Holyrood. Scotland has a drugs death crisis. There is an escalating number of drug deaths in Scotland - in 2018 a record total of 1,187. Thedeath rate in Scotland is the worst in the EUand three times higher than the UK as a whole. The SNP has voiced frustration that some radical solutions cannot be explored. At present, drugs policy is reserved to Westminster under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. The SNP manifesto wants the power to allow a consumption room in Glasgow where users could inject or smoke their own illegal drugs. But this has been put on holdbecause the Home Office refused permissionfor Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, to grant legal protection for it. The SNP argues the proposal would connect hard-to-reach users with drug treatment services and help cut the death toll among older addicts. It's a high-profile pledge but they acknowledge it's just one part of an issue that will require long-term action. Drugs policy is reserved to Westminster, whilst public health is devolved. Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts Demand the UK government matches Holyrood's climate change targets. While some parties have been throwing around new dates for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, the SNP has not. But then the ink is barely dry onScottish legislation which set 2045 as the new target year. Instead it commits its MPs to push the new UK government into helping Scotland achieve that target through accelerating the deployment of carbon capture, usage and storage -  a key technology for tackling the climate crisis - and matching Scotland's 2032 date for all new cars to be electric. It also wants taxation reformed to support ""greener choices"", like making our homes more energy-efficient. But the SNP insists Brexit must not be allowed to derail the train carrying us towards net-zero. And - unsurprisingly - suggests that the key to going even further in addressing climate change is... independence. Some energy policy is reserved, however Scotland has a number of powers for reducing climate emissions. Pass power over immigration to the Scottish Parliament so Scotland can have a migration system that works for its economy and society. Scotland faces more acute problems from demographic change than the rest of the UK. As the workforce is projected to shrink and the older population rises, it has had a slower inflow of migrants from overseas than England. There is a political consensus on the need to tackle the issue, with a more welcoming attitude to immigrants. Social attitude surveys, however, do not find such a big difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK. With the end of free movement of EU citizens, Brexit raises special challenges to several sectors of the economy, including the NHS, social care, construction and agriculture. Issues with a disproportionate presence in Scotland include food processing, tourism and universities. The SNP wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. It wants to cut the cost for employers of recruiting from overseas, and to simplify the visa and citizenship process. The party also says there should be a more welcoming approach to asylum seekers. If Scotland became independent and were then to re-join the European Union, it is accepted that membership would require the free movement of EU citizens, potentially leading to issues over the border between Scotland and England. Immigration is reserved to Westminster. Up the provision of paid leave for parents and encourage dads to take more time off. All the parties are making some kind of offer to new parents. The SNP's goes further than most. Nicola Sturgeon says its offer would be a ""game changer""- a new 12-week use-it-or-lose-it period of ""daddy leave"". Parents are currently entitled to convert up to 50 weeks of their 52-week maternity leave to shared parental leavebut take-up by dads has been ""stubbornly low"". The SNP is offering to extend this to 64 weeks with 12 weeks ring-fenced for fathers to encourage them to take the time off with their new babies. In addition it is offering to increase statutory pay and introduce stronger protections against redundancy for new parents. How the SNP could introduce this is open to question. Parental leave is covered by employment law and this is decided by Westminster, not Holyrood, so the SNP would need to win the support of other parties or introduce a private members' bill to deliver this proposal. Parental leave is reserved to Westminster. To find out more read oursimple guide to the SNP Give the Scottish Parliament control of employment law and more benefits. The SNP wants powers over employment rights to be devolved to Holyrood. With or without them, it wants the statutory living wage (which is Â£8.21 for those aged 25 and over) to go up to the ""real living wage"" - calculated on the basis of what workers need - by increasing it by Â£1.09 per hour on this year's figures. There is also a call for better protection for those on insecure work contracts. On welfare, the Scottish government is gathering newly devolved powers at Holyrood, pushing up the budget with a transfer of around Â£3bn next year. This is being used to soften the system applied by Whitehall, although the complexity of devolving powers is proving problematic, and some changes have been delayed from 2021 to 2024. On those powers still held at Westminster, the SNP wants to see a halt to the roll-out of universal credit. It is pushing for the reversal of some controversial measures on benefit entitlement introduced in recent years, including the freeze on working-age benefits. Most benefits, including pensions and Universal Credit, and workers' rights are reserved to Westminster. Give Holyrood power over train services to build better, greener public transport. Can shifting power from Westminster to Holyrood help deliver cleaner, greener public transport? The SNP thinks so. It says rail passengers would get a better deal if the Scottish Parliament controls both track and train - that is, the train operator, Scotrail, and Network Rail, which maintains the lines, signalling and many stations. Right now, Network Rail is ultimately controlled by Westminster. The SNP wants that to change. Why? Bitter experience shows passengers get fed up with delays caused by repair and upgrading works - and often blame Scotrail, regardless of whether it is its fault. Closer working between track engineers and train operators, the SNP argues, would make planning easier - and reduce disruption for commuters. The SNP has rejected Labour's railway nationalisation plans. A single, GB-wide company would, it says, strip powers away from Scotland. But it has left open the option of a public sector operator running Scotrail services in the future. It has made this case before, but political horse-trading after this election could give it the breakthrough it wants. Most rail policy is reserved to Westminster.

Here is a
recap of Wednesdayâs main events:   The Metro leads on the YouGov poll which claims the Conservatives will win a majority of 68 seats in the general election The Times says Mr Johnson is on course for a comfortable majority as a result of making gains at Labour's expense - based on the YouGov poll The FT reports a warning from the Resolution Foundation - that a new Conservative or Labour government would be likely to break its budgetary rules. The Guardian leads on the story we've been bringing you reaction to all day - a dossier released by the Labour Party which, it claims, is ""proof"" the Tories want to ""sell"" the NHS in a US-UK trade deal. Although different in style, the Mirror's front page isn't too different from the Guardian's in sentiment Refraining from a focus on the YouGov poll, the Telegraph's main story is Dominic Cummings' warning that the election is too close to call YouGov said it had interviewed around 100,000 people over the last seven days to research its MRP model. If the election were tomorrow it says the Lib Dems would win 13 constituencies (one more than they had before Parliament was dissolved), the SNP would win 43 (a gain of eight), while Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would remain static with four seats and one seat respectively. The YouGov model is seen as important by political observers because their last predictions called the hung
parliament and got 93% of seats correct. While this is impressive, thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether or not the 2017 result was a one-off
     success. The Conservatives will win the general election with a majority of 68 seats, according to a YouGov poll. Were the election held tomorrow, YouGov
projects the Tories would win 359 seats - 42 more than they took in 2017. Labour is on track to lose 51 MPs by securing 211 seats, the poll suggests. The poll suggests that the Conservatives would pick up seats from the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and the North. YouGov's MRP model was hotly anticipated because it is the method that first accurately projected a
hung parliament in 2017. Remember, there are caveats to this and any prediction should be treated with caution. The difference between this model and ordinary polling is that it applies national trends to constituencies, using demographics and previous results. This means it's more specific than national polling but will miss any truly local issues. And like other polls, the data can change between now and the
election. Expelled Conservative politician Lord Heseltine speaks to reporters at a Liberal Democrats press conference in central London Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP supporters at her party's manifesto launch in Glasgow An NHS worker poses with a dossier on US-UK trade talks. The papers were handed out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's event in London Big party policies were put to one side for a few minutes when Boris Johnson enjoyed a scone on a tour of Rodda""s Clotted Cream in Redruth, Cornwall Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons. They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected. Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos. The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month. Read our full story here. Some people on Twitter have
been speculating that a blog published earlier by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs
closest political adviser, had breached the civil service code and that he has since quit his role. Pre-election restrictions apply tomore than 440,000 civil servants working in the UK,external- staff who are politically impartial and work for government departments or agencies. In this period, they aren't allowed to do any work for ""political party purposes"". In Mr Cummings's 2,200-word posting, he says he has never been a member of a political party - but urges everyone who voted for the UK to leave the EU to support the Conservative Party in the next election. He also warns readers of a ""Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance"" in the event that the Tories fail to win a majority. However, the BBC has
confirmed with the Cabinet Office that he resigned as a special adviser at the start of the
campaign - along with all the other special advisers - as a formality. Stepping down at that point meant he would be able to campaign without breaking any rules. A Labour Party member in Plymouth has been criticised for sharing images of a postal vote on social media. Baz Ahmed tweeted a picture he was sent of a postal vote for Labour election candidate Luke Pollard, that revealed the voter's name and ballot paper number. The tweet has since been deleted. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport candidate Mr Pollardsaid on Twitter,externalhe advised his team and others ""not to share"" such pictures. Critics on social media said the move may have broken data protection and electoral laws. Read our full story here. What has happened so far today? Here is a mid-evening catch-up on the main events from today on the campaign trail. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Moving away from the topic of the NHS, Andrew Neil asks Justice Secretary Robert Buckland about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson has said anyone guilty of Islamophobia in his party would be ""out first bounce"". But Mr Neil accused Mr Buckland and his colleagues of allowing people to ""bounce back in"" again. Mr Buckland says: ""The record shows that we have been taking swift and immediate action to remove and suspend people who clearly have crossed that line into unacceptable, innapropriate and offensive comments."" But the BBC presenter challenges him, citing a recent example where a local councillor was thrown out of the party for Islamophobic comments made online - before being allowed back in again at a later date.  The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. Critics have said this does not go far enough, and that a review dealing solely with Islamophobia is what is needed. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Back to the question of what ""on the table"" actually means... The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Labour says the documents released earlier prove that this isn't the case. Mr Buckland says the six meetings were ""discussions of a preliminary nature"" about drug prices in a future US-UK trade deal. But he adds: ""That does not mean this is a negotiation based upon specific requirements. It's the sort of scoping discussion that happens in every free trade agreement. There's nothing unusual about this at all."" Andrew Neil pushes the Tory frontbencher, though, saying: ""There is nothing in these documents to say drug prices are not on the table."" Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Now it's the turn of Justice Secretary Robert Buckland in the hot seat. Presenter Andrew Neil begins by quoting International Trade Secretary Liz Truss when he spoke to her last week - she said the price the NHS pays for drugs was not on the table in US-UK trade talks. ""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today. Whissendine farmer Anthony Watchorn, who was running as an independent candidate, has died aged 69 after being taken to hospital yesterday. He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Younger peoplewere much less likely to votein the last two general elections compared to older people. So unsurprisingly, most voter registration adverts on Facebook were targeted at this under-35 age group. Read more here. Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

First bodies of UK lorry victims arrive in Vietnam,"Ambulances will take the victims' bodies to their homes The bodies of 16 Vietnamese people who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in the UK have arrived back in Vietnam. They were among 39 migrants - eight women and 31 males, including two boys aged 15 - found in Essex on 23 October. The bodies were flown to Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport, and will be taken by ambulance to their family homes. Investigations are under way in both the UK and Vietnam, anda lorry driver has admitted plotting to assist illegal immigration. ""We have been waiting for this moment for a very long time. We will organise the funeral as soon as he's returned,"" said Vo Van Binh, the father of one victim, Vo Van Linh. Speaking to AFP from Ha Tinh province, he said the family were ""very sad, but happy as finally my son is back"". The bodies of the remaining victims will be repatriated in the coming days, though a date has not been confirmed. The remains arrived in Hanoi early on Wednesday Repatriation of each body will cost each of the victims' families more than 66.2m Vietnamese dong ($2,856; Â£2,204), according to the vice minister of foreign affairs. The Vietnamese government had offered loans to relatives, though some have said this will only add to the debts they incurred by helping their relatives make the journey to the UK. Several Vietnamese organisations have helped to raise money for the families of the victims.More than $110,000 has now been crowdfundedto help support the families. Pham Thi Tra My was identified as one of the victims On 23 October, police found the bodies at the back of a refrigerated lorry in the town of Grays in Essex, eastern England. One of the victims, Pham Thi Tra My, had sent distressing messages to her family on the evening of 22 October. Who are the victims in the Essex lorry tragedy? ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed,"" it read. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad.""

Couple fall victim to holiday scam in BelfastSimone and Alice Cardillo arrived at their accommodation to find it was empty and for sale.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Simone and Alice Cardillo say they fell victim to a false Airbnb listing in Belfast A couple have spoken of how they became victims of a holiday scam during a trip to Northern Ireland. Simone and Alice Cardillo arrived at their accommodation in Belfast to find it was empty and for sale. They had booked and paid for the bogus property using the booking site, Airbnb. It later refunded the money and removed the fake post. It said these types of scams are extremely rare on its site, but when they do happen, it acts quickly. Airbnb will verify listings, 11 years after launch Effect of Airbnb surge on UK cities revealed Council-tenant Airbnb host fined Â£100,000 ""From the outside you could tell there was something weird,"" said Simone who comes from Italy. ""We rang the door and nobody answered. It didn't look like an Airbnb or like anyone was living there,"" said his French partner Alice. ""We called the host, it was a woman and she told us that it wasn't here and that she wasn't living in Belfast. ""We were pretty stranded. We had our big backpacks and we didn't know what to do. We spent the whole afternoon and evening trying to find a new place."" Those behind these scams are thought to be able to create new listings again, meaning more people get caught out. Police Service of Northern Ireland chief superintendent Simon Walls said the whole holiday market is a place where people need to be careful and be sure that what they are booking is genuine. ""We know of people who've booked what they've thought are really good value weekends in good hotels and they've turned up to find there's been no booking,"" he said. The accommodation the couple paid for never existed, they said ""We've heard of people who've booked expensive apartments in Spain and it's either been a building site or there's nothing there."" Police suspect most of the scammers are operating thousands of miles away. ""If you're booking a holiday that seems too cheap or if you're booking an apartment or hotel and you're not sure it exists, there are ways you can check it out,"" he said. ""You can find out addresses, you can look at photographs and check online reviews. And all that gives you some sort of hint on whether the premises actually exists."" These types of scams are also affecting people from Northern Ireland who are booking accommodation abroad. In July, Scamwise NI, reported that a woman from County Armagh fell victim to a holiday scam after booking a holiday to Spain. She paid Â£1,350 for accommodation in an apartment for a week. Closer to the time of her holiday she tried contacting them to arrange for the collection of keys but the website had disappeared and no one responded to her. Last month, Lord Alan Sugar warned his twitter followers of Airbnb scams after an American family of six turned up at one of his properties in London. He claimed they had paid over $600 believing they were staying in one of his properties for three days after scammers took a photo from an estate agents web site. Airbnb said these types of scams are extremely rare on their site, but when they do happen they act quickly. ""Fake or misrepresented listings have no place in our community and our systems constantly evaluate hundreds of risk signals to identify and stop bad actors. Our team works tirelessly on tools to stay ahead of fraudsters, strengthen our defences and educate hosts and guests about protecting their personal details and staying safe online.""

"UK would be 'outgunned' in Russia conflictThe UK has a critical shortage of artillery and ammunition, according to a defence think-tank.UK","British ground forces would be ""comprehensively outgunned"" in a conflict with Russia in Eastern Europe, according to a defence think-tank. Research by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) found that the Army, as well as Nato allies, has a ""critical shortage"" of artillery and ammunition. It concluded that it could not maintain a credible defence position. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK works closely with Nato and is ""well equipped to take on a leading role"". The research comes ahead of a meeting of Nato leaders in London next week to mark the 70th anniversary of the alliance. The UK, along with other Nato members, has positioned military forces in Eastern Europe to deter any potential Russian aggression in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Around 800 British troops arecurrently stationed in Estonia. The first were sent in 2017. Nato alliance is brain dead, says Macron Strength of British military falls for ninth year MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' But the study by Rusi found that the UK armed forces lack critical firepower compared to Russia's military. It analysed military capabilities in the ""unlikely"" context of ""a high-intensity conflict between Nato and Russia, in which the UK has promised to deliver a warfighting division"". ""At present, there is a risk that the UK - unable to credibly fight - can be dominated lower down the escalation ladder by powers threatening escalation,"" the report said. It said Britain is ""comprehensively outgunned and outranged"", leaving enemy artillery free to defeat UK units. Russian artillery and rocket batteries have already proved to be potent, destroying two Ukrainian battalions in 2014 within minutes. UK and other Nato forces not only have a limited number of artillery pieces, but also a shortage of munitions stockpiles and transportation. The report said the ""rejuvenation and modernisation"" of Britain's ground-based artillery is an ""urgent and critical priority"". In response, the MoD said: ""The UK does not stand alone but alongside its Nato Allies, who work closely together across air, sea, land, nuclear and cyber to deter threats and respond to crises."" It added: ""As the largest Nato defence spender in Europe, the UK's armed forces are well equipped to take a leading role in countering threats and ensuring the safety and security of British people at home and abroad."" The statement comes less than three weeks after French President Emmanuel Macrondescribed Nato as ""brain dead""- stressing what he sees as waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor, the US. MoD figures released in August found that the size of Britain's armed forceshad fallen for a ninth consecutive year. The finding came just six months after the Commons spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, claimed theMoD had a funding black hole of at least Â£7bnin its 10-year plan to equip the UK's armed forces. A delegation ofRussian military personnel visited Scotland last yearto observe one of Europe's largest Nato exercises. The visit was in line with the UK's obligations to the Vienna Document which aims to promote mutual trust and transparency among states signed to it. It came asUN Secretary General Antonio Guterresclaimed the Cold War was ""back with a vengeance"" as he warned abut the dangers of escalating tensions over Syria.

Couple fall victim to holiday scam in Belfast,"This video can not be played Simone and Alice Cardillo say they fell victim to a false Airbnb listing in Belfast A couple have spoken of how they became victims of a holiday scam during a trip to Northern Ireland. Simone and Alice Cardillo arrived at their accommodation in Belfast to find it was empty and for sale. They had booked and paid for the bogus property using the booking site, Airbnb. It later refunded the money and removed the fake post. It said these types of scams are extremely rare on its site, but when they do happen, it acts quickly. Airbnb will verify listings, 11 years after launch Effect of Airbnb surge on UK cities revealed Council-tenant Airbnb host fined Â£100,000 ""From the outside you could tell there was something weird,"" said Simone who comes from Italy. ""We rang the door and nobody answered. It didn't look like an Airbnb or like anyone was living there,"" said his French partner Alice. ""We called the host, it was a woman and she told us that it wasn't here and that she wasn't living in Belfast. ""We were pretty stranded. We had our big backpacks and we didn't know what to do. We spent the whole afternoon and evening trying to find a new place."" Those behind these scams are thought to be able to create new listings again, meaning more people get caught out. Police Service of Northern Ireland chief superintendent Simon Walls said the whole holiday market is a place where people need to be careful and be sure that what they are booking is genuine. ""We know of people who've booked what they've thought are really good value weekends in good hotels and they've turned up to find there's been no booking,"" he said. The accommodation the couple paid for never existed, they said ""We've heard of people who've booked expensive apartments in Spain and it's either been a building site or there's nothing there."" Police suspect most of the scammers are operating thousands of miles away. ""If you're booking a holiday that seems too cheap or if you're booking an apartment or hotel and you're not sure it exists, there are ways you can check it out,"" he said. ""You can find out addresses, you can look at photographs and check online reviews. And all that gives you some sort of hint on whether the premises actually exists."" These types of scams are also affecting people from Northern Ireland who are booking accommodation abroad. In July, Scamwise NI, reported that a woman from County Armagh fell victim to a holiday scam after booking a holiday to Spain. She paid Â£1,350 for accommodation in an apartment for a week. Closer to the time of her holiday she tried contacting them to arrange for the collection of keys but the website had disappeared and no one responded to her. Last month, Lord Alan Sugar warned his twitter followers of Airbnb scams after an American family of six turned up at one of his properties in London. He claimed they had paid over $600 believing they were staying in one of his properties for three days after scammers took a photo from an estate agents web site. Airbnb said these types of scams are extremely rare on their site, but when they do happen they act quickly.

Here is a
recap of Wednesdayâs main events:   The Metro leads on the YouGov poll which claims the Conservatives will win a majority of 68 seats in the general election The Times says Mr Johnson is on course for a comfortable majority as a result of making gains at Labour's expense - based on the YouGov poll The FT reports a warning from the Resolution Foundation - that a new Conservative or Labour government would be likely to break its budgetary rules. The Guardian leads on the story we've been bringing you reaction to all day - a dossier released by the Labour Party which, it claims, is ""proof"" the Tories want to ""sell"" the NHS in a US-UK trade deal. Although different in style, the Mirror's front page isn't too different from the Guardian's in sentiment Refraining from a focus on the YouGov poll, the Telegraph's main story is Dominic Cummings' warning that the election is too close to call YouGov said it had interviewed around 100,000 people over the last seven days to research its MRP model. If the election were tomorrow it says the Lib Dems would win 13 constituencies (one more than they had before Parliament was dissolved), the SNP would win 43 (a gain of eight), while Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would remain static with four seats and one seat respectively. The YouGov model is seen as important by political observers because their last predictions called the hung
parliament and got 93% of seats correct. While this is impressive, thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether or not the 2017 result was a one-off
     success. The Conservatives will win the general election with a majority of 68 seats, according to a YouGov poll. Were the election held tomorrow, YouGov
projects the Tories would win 359 seats - 42 more than they took in 2017. Labour is on track to lose 51 MPs by securing 211 seats, the poll suggests. The poll suggests that the Conservatives would pick up seats from the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and the North. YouGov's MRP model was hotly anticipated because it is the method that first accurately projected a
hung parliament in 2017. Remember, there are caveats to this and any prediction should be treated with caution. The difference between this model and ordinary polling is that it applies national trends to constituencies, using demographics and previous results. This means it's more specific than national polling but will miss any truly local issues. And like other polls, the data can change between now and the
election. Expelled Conservative politician Lord Heseltine speaks to reporters at a Liberal Democrats press conference in central London Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP supporters at her party's manifesto launch in Glasgow An NHS worker poses with a dossier on US-UK trade talks. The papers were handed out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's event in London Big party policies were put to one side for a few minutes when Boris Johnson enjoyed a scone on a tour of Rodda""s Clotted Cream in Redruth, Cornwall Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons. They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected. Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos. The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month. Read our full story here. Some people on Twitter have
been speculating that a blog published earlier by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs
closest political adviser, had breached the civil service code and that he has since quit his role. Pre-election restrictions apply tomore than 440,000 civil servants working in the UK,external- staff who are politically impartial and work for government departments or agencies. In this period, they aren't allowed to do any work for ""political party purposes"". In Mr Cummings's 2,200-word posting, he says he has never been a member of a political party - but urges everyone who voted for the UK to leave the EU to support the Conservative Party in the next election. He also warns readers of a ""Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance"" in the event that the Tories fail to win a majority. However, the BBC has
confirmed with the Cabinet Office that he resigned as a special adviser at the start of the
campaign - along with all the other special advisers - as a formality. Stepping down at that point meant he would be able to campaign without breaking any rules. A Labour Party member in Plymouth has been criticised for sharing images of a postal vote on social media. Baz Ahmed tweeted a picture he was sent of a postal vote for Labour election candidate Luke Pollard, that revealed the voter's name and ballot paper number. The tweet has since been deleted. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport candidate Mr Pollardsaid on Twitter,externalhe advised his team and others ""not to share"" such pictures. Critics on social media said the move may have broken data protection and electoral laws. Read our full story here. What has happened so far today? Here is a mid-evening catch-up on the main events from today on the campaign trail. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Moving away from the topic of the NHS, Andrew Neil asks Justice Secretary Robert Buckland about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson has said anyone guilty of Islamophobia in his party would be ""out first bounce"". But Mr Neil accused Mr Buckland and his colleagues of allowing people to ""bounce back in"" again. Mr Buckland says: ""The record shows that we have been taking swift and immediate action to remove and suspend people who clearly have crossed that line into unacceptable, innapropriate and offensive comments."" But the BBC presenter challenges him, citing a recent example where a local councillor was thrown out of the party for Islamophobic comments made online - before being allowed back in again at a later date.  The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. Critics have said this does not go far enough, and that a review dealing solely with Islamophobia is what is needed. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Back to the question of what ""on the table"" actually means... The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Labour says the documents released earlier prove that this isn't the case. Mr Buckland says the six meetings were ""discussions of a preliminary nature"" about drug prices in a future US-UK trade deal. But he adds: ""That does not mean this is a negotiation based upon specific requirements. It's the sort of scoping discussion that happens in every free trade agreement. There's nothing unusual about this at all."" Andrew Neil pushes the Tory frontbencher, though, saying: ""There is nothing in these documents to say drug prices are not on the table."" Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Now it's the turn of Justice Secretary Robert Buckland in the hot seat. Presenter Andrew Neil begins by quoting International Trade Secretary Liz Truss when he spoke to her last week - she said the price the NHS pays for drugs was not on the table in US-UK trade talks. ""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today. Whissendine farmer Anthony Watchorn, who was running as an independent candidate, has died aged 69 after being taken to hospital yesterday. He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Younger peoplewere much less likely to votein the last two general elections compared to older people. So unsurprisingly, most voter registration adverts on Facebook were targeted at this under-35 age group. Read more here. Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today.

Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Proof NHS at risk under US trade deal' - LabourJeremy Corbyn says party has compiled 451-page dossier showing drug prices could rise and NHS services put up for grabs.Election 2019,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This election is now a fight for survival of NHS"" A row has broken out after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed he had ""proof"" the NHS was at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Mr Corbyn said he had a 451-page dossier showing initial talks had taken place, proving the NHS was ""for sale"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claims were ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. The Tory manifesto explicitly states neither the price paid for drugs nor NHS services will be ""on the table"". Meanwhilethe SNP has published its manifestowhich includes a pledge to ""stop the NHS becoming a lever in any international trade deal"" through its NHS Protection Act. And other parties have criticised the Tories, including Liberal Democrat shadow Brexit secretary Tom Brake, who said the public would be ""horrified by what looks like a deal cooked up between the Tories and Donald Trump that puts our NHS on the table"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Reality Check: Five things from the leaked trade papers What we learned from the leaked US trade documents Jeremy Corbyn interview fact-checked Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said the Conservative Party ""can no longer claim the NHS is not for sale"", adding: ""Under their watch, it is."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn's 451 page NHS dossier is a ""diversionary tactic"" Mark Dayan, policy analyst and the head of public affairs at the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was not being ""flogged off"" in the sense that US companies will not own hospitals. But he said the documents suggest the US is trying various tactics to get the NHS to pay more money to their pharmaceutical companies for the drugs that they sell. ""Obviously from the NHS's point of view, that is a concern... you're really losing out in that situation,"" he said. Mr Dayan said if talks with the US continue, UK negotiators must ""push hard for the interests of the UK and the NHS"". This video can not be played Barry Gardiner and Andrew Neil on Labour claims about UK-US talks about the UK market for buying drugs. Labour obtained uncensored government documents covering six rounds of talks between US and UK officials in Washington and London between July 2017 and July 2019. They are all preparatory meetings ahead of formal trade talks. These documents provide more detail on the meetingsChannel 4's Dispatches programme reported,externalon last month. They show the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly, extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used. One document quotes a UK official saying the talks are helpful in determining the areas the US may want to discuss, while acknowledging the UK would have objections. As well as the pharmaceutical industry, the talks also covered other areas including agriculture and climate change. The UK team inquired about including a reference to climate change in any US-UK trade deal, something the US side said was not allowed by Congress. The document also refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks - but says it is up to other countries to specify anything they want to be excluded from talks. There is no indication in the documents that the UK team agreed to anything in the talks. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't provide evidence ministers have agreed the health service should be part of a trade deal with US. But details of discussions about the demands of US pharmaceutical companies will still be motivating for Labour voters worried about the NHS. ""Not for sale,"" has been the biggest mantra at Labour events, even though the Tories have always furiously denied the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". It's clear US drug companies want access to UK markets - Labour suggests the UK has agreed they could extend the patents on some medicines, which could cost the NHS more, for example. But whether any UK government would ever do a deal that made medicines much more expensive for the NHS, and therefore the taxpayer, which would be massively costly for the government and probably prove deeply unpopular, is a big political question. The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Currently, the NHS is able to use its bargaining power as a centralised health system to negotiate low prices for drugs. It also has a strong track record in resisting attempts to lengthen patents on drugs, to allow cheaper generics to be used more quickly than they are in the US. The US currently pays two and a half times more for drugs than the NHS does. Meanwhile, about 7% of the NHS budget in England goes on private companies that provide NHS services, mainly non-emergency treatments such as knee and hip replacements and some community services. And Labour has warned this market could be extended further under the Tories. Mr Corbyn said the documents showed talks were at a ""very advanced stage"" and gave the lie to Boris Johnson's claims the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. ""The uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters,"" he told a news conference in London. ""We have now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. ""He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda and today it has been exposed."" Reacting to Mr Corbyn's latest claims, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was simply a stunt. ""Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out and out lying about what the documents contain. ""People should not believe what he says."" Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said the claims were ""total nonsense"". ""This is continually brought up by the Labour Party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering,"" he said. And he could give an ""absolute cast iron guarantee"" the NHS would not be on the table. He also pointed out the documents had been available online for two months.

Corbyn: Lower earners could pay more tax under LabourLabour previously claimed only the top 5% of earners would pay more to fund public services.Election 2019,"Jeremy Corbyn has admitted some of those on lower incomes could pay more tax under a future Labour government. The Labour leader had previously insisted only the richest 5% of taxpayers, those earning about Â£80,000 a year or more, would face tax rises. But he was forced to concede a plan to scrap a tax break for married couples would impact those earning less. Mr Corbyn argued in a BBC interview that those affected would benefit from a higher living wage. ""They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four-year-olds,"" he added. Live: SNP manifesto and other campaign news Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? IFS wrong on Labour tax plans, says John McDonnell Challenged on the policyin an interview with Andrew Neilon Tuesday night, Mr Corbyn conceded couples in receipt of the marriage allowance would no longer receive a reduction in tax if he wins power next month. ""They won't get the advantage, it's actually taking away Â£250,"" he said. The tax break was brought in by David Cameron in 2015 to promote marriage, with stay-at-home mothers and women who work part-time expected to be the main winners. It is available to married couples and civil partners with a combined income of under Â£62,500 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and up to Â£43,430 in Scotland. Themarriage allowance,externalis a tax relief for married couples and civil partners that allows one partner to transfer part of their personal allowance to the other. To benefit as a couple, the lower earner must normally have an income below their personal allowance, which is usually Â£12,500. It reduces the couple's tax bill by up to Â£250 a year. In the year to April 2019, 1.78 million people claimed the tax break, out of the 4.2 million couples eligible to receive it. When Labour published its general election manifesto last week it said there would be no increases in VAT, income tax or national insurance for 95% of taxpayers - those earning less than Â£80,000 - if it wins power on 12 December. The party is insisting that that is still the case and only a ""limited"" number of those on low incomes would be affected. Scrapping the marriage allowance was not in Labour's manifesto, but was included in an accompanying document, the so-calledgrey book,external, setting out how the party plans to pay for its spending commitments. Who should I vote for? Our policy guide,external A to Z: Our tool to help explain the election,external Which seats could turn the election?,external In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn repeated that only people who earned more than Â£80,000 a year would see a tax increase. He said scrapping the marriage allowance would be a ""step towards equality"" because ""those people that are cohabiting in a very happy family atmosphere and bringing up children do not get the benefit of that"". Defending the move, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said married and unmarried couples facing ""tough times"" would see their ""income boosted"" in other ways. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who had received the tax allowance would benefit from Labour's plan for 30 hours of free childcare for all two-to-four year olds and a Â£10 minimum wage. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Asked if the move amounted to a tax rise, he said: ""That allowance is going away but it is more than made up for in the extra resources they will be getting."" Tuesday evening's half-hour interview with Andrew Neil, whois also speaking to other party leadersduring the election, also saw Mr Corbyn struggle to explain how Labour's pledge to restore pensions to women born in the 1950s would be paid. The policy's estimated Â£58bn cost over five years would be paid for through government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. Mr Corbynalso declined to apologise to the UK Jewish communityafter the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed the ""poison"" of anti-Semitism within Labour was ""sanctioned from the very top"". Defending his leader's performance, Mr Burgon said Mr Corbyn had already apologised for the ""hurt caused"" to many Jewish people (in 2018). He said compensating the Waspi women was entirely justified - suggesting money had effectively been stolen from them. ""This amounts to theft and robbery of money these women paid into (their pension schemes) and money that they are entitled to,"" he said. The Conservatives said Labour was not able to answer how it would pay for their ""fantasy plans for the country"", which risked taxpayers ""footing the bill"".

Trump invited to impeachment hearing,"President Trump, pictured with First Lady Melania Trump, would be able to question witnesses at the hearing Congress has invited US President Donald Trump to its first impeachment hearing on 4 December. Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Mr Trump could either attend or ""stop complaining about the process"". If he does attend, the president would be able to question witnesses. It would mark the next stage in the impeachment inquiry, which centres on a July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, President Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, currently the front runner to be the Democratic candidate in next year's presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden, who had previously worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The probe is looking into whether Mr Trump used the threat of withholding US military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. The president has denied any wrongdoing and has called the inquiry a ""witch hunt"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Last week, the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up two weeks of public hearings, which followed several weeks of closed-door witness interviews. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the committees leading the probe - Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs - are now working on their report, which will be issued on 3 December. On Tuesday, the latest transcript of inquiry evidence was released, detailing testimony by senior budget official Mark Sandy. Mr Sandy told the House investigators that two White House budget officials had resigned following the withholding of military aid to Ukraine. He said that one, a lawyer, had expressed concern that the action could be a violation of a 1974 budget law. Mr Nadler said in a statement that he had written to Mr Trump inviting him to the hearing next month. ""At base, the president has a choice to make,"" Mr Nadler said. ""He can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process. ""I hope that he chooses to participate in the inquiry, directly or through counsel, as other presidents have done before him."" Jerrold Nadler said Mr Trump should either attend the hearing or ""stop complaining"" In his letter to the president, Mr Nadler said the hearing would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment. ""We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment,"" he added. He has given Mr Trump until 18:00 EST (23:00 GMT) on 1 December to confirm whether or not he will be at the hearing, and if so, to let the committee know who his counsel will be. The Judiciary Committee is expected to begin drafting articles of impeachment - which are the charges of wrongdoing against the president - in early December. After a vote in the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would be held in the Republican-run Senate. If Mr Trump was convicted by a two-thirds majority - an outcome deemed highly unlikely - he would become the first US president to be removed from office through impeachment. The White House and some Republicans want the trial to be limited to two weeks.

Why are service station snacks so expensive?,"An urgent need to go to the loo prompts most visits to a motorway service station, rather than any particular desire to stop and shop. But the price drivers and their families pay if they then choose to stock up on snacks has been laid bare by mystery shoppers. A bottle of water costs four times more than in a supermarket, the snapshot of prices by insurer Admiral suggests. No wonder value for money at services scored poorly in a recent driver poll. Only 59% of visitors rated food and drink as good value for money, compared with a general satisfaction rate of the service station experience in England of 90%, according to lobby group Transport Focus. Operators point out that these sites can be expensive to run, and visitors can park and use the facilities for free, without any obligation to buy anything. Yet, many drivers complain that they have little choice but to pay high prices, as service stations are generally the only option on the country's motorways. The mystery shop by Admiral researchers is only a snapshot of 21 of the UK's service stations during October, out of more than 100 in the UK. Prices can change and promotions can easily bring down prices. Families will be planning motorway trips to visit relatives this Christmas, and may be more conscious of prices at this already-expensive time of the year. So they may choose to fill water bottles for free, rather than pay up to Â£2.29 for a 500ml bottle of water, as was found by the mystery shoppers at Beaconsfield Services on the M40. The operator, Extra Motorway Services, has not responded to a request for comment. Water bottles can be refilled at Beaconsfield, but shoppers found a Â£2.29 bottle Across all 21 service stations the average price for water was Â£1.32 more expensive than a 44p bottle that could be found in a supermarket - so four times the cost. Clare Egan, head of motor product at Admiral, said: ""We all expect to pay a little more for convenience, [but] grabbing the essentials from home or at least a supermarket before setting off could result in some big savings on the overall cost of your journey. ""Given the availability of free water refills at all of the service stations and the push to be plastic-free, motorists don't need to spend anything on bottled water."" The operator of the services at Durham said higher prices could be explained The full basket of drinks and snacks price-tested by researchers also included a cheese sandwich, a cold sausage roll, a packet of ready salted crisps, a packet of wine gums, a bar of chocolate, and a bottle of Coke. Roadchef's Durham services on the A1(M) came out most expensive of the 21 tested. The total cost was nearly Â£10 more expensive than a supermarket best price, researchers said. A spokesman for Roadchef said that, unlike the vast majority of its outlets, Durham had to buy in sandwiches rather than making them on site. He said most other items were uniformly priced across sites, competitive against others, and there was a range of choices for customers. ""Like all our sites Durham resembles a mini high street, and offers premium and value options depending on our customers' preferences,"" he said. He added that there were greater overheads in running service stations, which were required to be open for 24 hours every day, unlike many town and city centre retailers. They also faced costs to maintain land and, at times, water treatment works. The mystery shop also revealed big differences between service stations on the cost of petrol, with unleaded prices varying by 20p a litre. The tired motorist might also be surprised to discover that the price of a regular latte varied by Â£2 depending on which service station they stopped at. Such price differentials for the nation's favourite bought hot drink can also be found on the High Street, so it is an issue not only found on the motorway. In July, Transport Focus published the results of itscustomer survey,externalcovering all of England's service stations. It found a generally high level of satisfaction, with Roadchef's Norton Canes services on the M6 toll coming out on top. Yet, it too raised the issue of prices. ""Motorway users tell us they have a good experience when visiting service areas, but it's clear that many do not feel the experience is good value for money,"" said Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith.

Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film banBlue Story film-maker Rapman insists his movie had nothing to do with a mass brawl at a Vue cinema.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Rapman says he feels cheated following Vue's decision The director of a film at the centre of a storm over violence in cinemas has said he feels ""bullied"" and ""cheated"" after it was banned by the Vue chain. Rapman said Blue Story had nothing to do with a mass brawl involving machetes at a Vue in Birmingham, which left seven police officers injured. Vue pulled the British film, saying it had sparked 25 incidents nationwide. But Rapman said there ""was no link to Blue Story"" and asked whether there were ""hidden reasons"" behind the ban. Five teenagers were arrested after the fight in Birmingham's Star City complex on Saturday. The writer and director told BBC arts editor Will Gompertz: ""They were just in a cinema apparently for Frozen [2], but then they pinned it on Blue Story."" Vue said there had been a total of 25 ""significant incidents"" at its sites around the country, all involving people either watching, buying tickets for, going in to watch or leaving screenings of Blue Story. Rapman (centre) on the set of Blue Story Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, said there was ""no connection"" between the Birmingham brawl and his movie. ""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing? ""You start thinking of all these things, and it was an upsetting time."" A spokesperson for Vue said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race. 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Girl, 13, among 'machete' brawl cinema arrests Rapman: 'When I was at school, I focused on surviving' The rapper-turned-film-maker, who rose to prominence in 2017 with his hit YouTube series Shiro's Story, said taking a machete to a cinema was ""barbaric"", but asked Vue to give details of the other incidents. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""They say that there's been a number of incidents, but where's the proof? Where's the evidence? Where? ""We live in a camera generation now. If anything happens, the youth are going to film that and you will see it. How come we haven't seen any footage of the rest of these incidents? ""I feel like that was just something to say to cover their decision, which already wasn't justified because the [original] incident had no connection to Blue Story."" Vue founder and chief executive Tim Richards said incidents involving groups took place at 16 cinemas in total, starting on Friday morning - the day of Blue Story's release - until Saturday evening, when it was pulled. ""In over 30 years of working in cinema exhibition in the UK, I have never seen a nationwide issue like this affecting so many cinemas in such a short space of time,"" Mr Richards said. The chain classes ""significant incidents"" as those involving illegal activity, harassment, intimidation, violence, public disorder, or anything requiring security, medical, fire or police intervention. But Vue has not given specific details of the incidents or where they took place. ""We have reviewed and assessed each and every incident in detail as part of our ongoing process of making decisions as to how we could possibly keep Blue Story on our screens,"" Mr Richards said. Additional security was put in place, but ""we were still not satisfied the risk had been reduced to an acceptable level"", he added. Mr Richards also said Blue Story, which has a 15 certificate, attracted a ""very young audience"". Reports suggesting those involved in the incidents were there to watch other films - such as Frozen 2 - were ""simply not true"", he added. ""A younger audience were attempting to purchase tickets for other movies to access the Blue Story screenings and were also resisting requests for ID. This also played a key role in incidents and our decision."" This video can not be played Blue Story is the tale of two friends who become rivals West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""officers were attacked by quite young children"" in Birmingham on Saturday, including ""12, 13-year-olds who were there in quite large numbers"". His force had not asked the chain to pull screenings of the film, he added. ""But we have to ask why and how did so many young children turn up in such quite large numbers, some of them armed to attack other people. It's fortunate there wasn't any serious injury on Saturday, but my goodness there could have been."" The film is based on gangs in south London Rapman said he knew his film would appeal to young people, but he had no reason to suspect it might attract violence. ""The two gangs that the film's based on, which are real gangs, have been in a cinema screen watching it together, laughing together, joking together, and leaving a cinema connected, happy seeing the area they grew up in."" Blue Story follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham - two areas that have a notorious rivalry. It is released by the Paramount film studio, which offered to provide extra security at cinemas, Rapman said. The movie is also backed by BBC Films. ""Paramount have definitely offered every single site extra security if they need it. How hard would that be to just get more [security] people there?"" Showcase originally followed Vue's lead in pulling the film, but later reinstated it. Odeon and Cineworld have continued showing the movie. Vue's move has led to a vocal backlash, with some accusing the chain of being ""institutionally racist"". Vue has said its decision was made ""on grounds of safety alone"" and not because of ""biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself"". But Rapman said: ""They've alienated themselves from a big audience there. The explanation came with no evidence, no facts. ""I feel like they bullied me because I'm a small film. They wouldn't have pulled Frozen, they wouldn't have pulled Last Christmas. They pulled a little independent movie that needs it more than them other movies."" He feels ""cheated"" as a result, he added. ""I feel it's always the upward hurdles coming from our background. I always knew it was never going to be smooth. But the last thing I thought was a cinema would ban us from every single site. I just don't think they respect me. They don't respect my movie."" Rapman at the Blue Story premiere earlier this month Rapman said Blue Story is ""about what people do for the people they love, and how love can make people make the wrong decisions - and the right decisions sometimes"". He told BBC News: ""If you watch the film, you will understand. The last line of the whole trailer is, 'I'm not trying to justify, but I'm going to show you what these young boys are fighting for'. ""I'm not justifying their actions, but go and see why they are fighting, see why they're stabbing and see what they're doing all these things, just so you can see their motivation and maybe we can help prevent that, so they don't have to pick up a weapon again."" In his statement, Vue's Tim Richards added: ""We wholeheartedly agree that the issues that have arisen are not about the film, but neither are they about Vue. The chain screens more than 500 films a year ""in a range of diverse content"", he explained. ""We are in the business of showing movies, not withdrawing movies."" Blue Story opened on Friday 22 November on 310 screens in the UK and Ireland and made Â£1.3 million over the weekend. That was enough to secure it third place on this week's UK and Ireland box office chart, behind Frozen 2 and Last Christmas. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Corbyn: Lower earners could pay more tax under Labour,"Jeremy Corbyn has admitted some of those on lower incomes could pay more tax under a future Labour government. The Labour leader had previously insisted only the richest 5% of taxpayers, those earning about Â£80,000 a year or more, would face tax rises. But he was forced to concede a plan to scrap a tax break for married couples would impact those earning less. Mr Corbyn argued in a BBC interview that those affected would benefit from a higher living wage. ""They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four-year-olds,"" he added. Live: SNP manifesto and other campaign news Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? IFS wrong on Labour tax plans, says John McDonnell Challenged on the policyin an interview with Andrew Neilon Tuesday night, Mr Corbyn conceded couples in receipt of the marriage allowance would no longer receive a reduction in tax if he wins power next month. ""They won't get the advantage, it's actually taking away Â£250,"" he said. The tax break was brought in by David Cameron in 2015 to promote marriage, with stay-at-home mothers and women who work part-time expected to be the main winners. It is available to married couples and civil partners with a combined income of under Â£62,500 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and up to Â£43,430 in Scotland. Themarriage allowance,externalis a tax relief for married couples and civil partners that allows one partner to transfer part of their personal allowance to the other. To benefit as a couple, the lower earner must normally have an income below their personal allowance, which is usually Â£12,500. It reduces the couple's tax bill by up to Â£250 a year. In the year to April 2019, 1.78 million people claimed the tax break, out of the 4.2 million couples eligible to receive it. When Labour published its general election manifesto last week it said there would be no increases in VAT, income tax or national insurance for 95% of taxpayers - those earning less than Â£80,000 - if it wins power on 12 December. The party is insisting that that is still the case and only a ""limited"" number of those on low incomes would be affected. Scrapping the marriage allowance was not in Labour's manifesto, but was included in an accompanying document, the so-calledgrey book,external, setting out how the party plans to pay for its spending commitments. Who should I vote for? Our policy guide,external A to Z: Our tool to help explain the election,external Which seats could turn the election?,external In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn repeated that only people who earned more than Â£80,000 a year would see a tax increase. He said scrapping the marriage allowance would be a ""step towards equality"" because ""those people that are cohabiting in a very happy family atmosphere and bringing up children do not get the benefit of that"". Defending the move, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said married and unmarried couples facing ""tough times"" would see their ""income boosted"" in other ways. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who had received the tax allowance would benefit from Labour's plan for 30 hours of free childcare for all two-to-four year olds and a Â£10 minimum wage. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Asked if the move amounted to a tax rise, he said: ""That allowance is going away but it is more than made up for in the extra resources they will be getting."" Tuesday evening's half-hour interview with Andrew Neil, whois also speaking to other party leadersduring the election, also saw Mr Corbyn struggle to explain how Labour's pledge to restore pensions to women born in the 1950s would be paid. The policy's estimated Â£58bn cost over five years would be paid for through government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. Mr Corbynalso declined to apologise to the UK Jewish communityafter the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed the ""poison"" of anti-Semitism within Labour was ""sanctioned from the very top"". Defending his leader's performance, Mr Burgon said Mr Corbyn had already apologised for the ""hurt caused"" to many Jewish people (in 2018). He said compensating the Waspi women was entirely justified - suggesting money had effectively been stolen from them. ""This amounts to theft and robbery of money these women paid into (their pension schemes) and money that they are entitled to,"" he said. The Conservatives said Labour was not able to answer how it would pay for their ""fantasy plans for the country"", which risked taxpayers ""footing the bill"".

UK 'has particularly extreme form of capitalism',"The UK has one of the most extreme forms of capitalism in the world and we urgently need to rethink the role of business in society. That's according to Prof Colin Mayer, author ofa new report on the future of the corporation,externalfor the British Academy. Prof Mayer says that global crises such as the environment and growing inequality are forcing a reassessment of what business is for. ""The corporation has failed to deliver benefit beyond shareholders, to its stakeholders and its wider community,"" he said. ""At the moment, how we conceptualise business is, it's there to make money. But instead, we should think about it as an incredibly powerful tool for solving our problems in the world."" He said the ownership structure of companies had made the UK one of the worst examples of responsible capitalism. ""The UK has a particularly extreme form of capitalism and ownership,"" he said. ""Most ownership in the UK is in the hands of a large number of institutional investors, none of which have a significant controlling shareholding in our largest companies. That is quite unlike virtually any other country in the world, including the United States."" This heavily dispersed form of ownership means none of the owners is providing a genuinely long-term perspective on how to achieve goals while also making money. Established in 1902, the British Academy is the UK's national academy for the humanities and the social sciences. In Principles for Purposeful Business, it proposes a new formula for corporate purpose: ""to profitably solve problems of people and planet, and not profit from causing problems."" The Academy's report comes a week afterthe Labour Party manifesto proposed the biggest shake-up of how business is owned and run in decades. It included the nationalisation of water, rail, energy, mail, broadband and the forced transfer of company shares to employees. Prof Mayer agreed that the Labour manifesto was bold in its ambition, but said it was too traditional and old-fashioned in its way of achieving its aims. Marmite-maker Unilever has long been admired for its approach to its societal impact ""It's very much focused on one particular means of delivery, that is through the state,"" he said. ""Now, the state has an important part to play. But we should think about the state in a more imaginative way, as to how it can promote successful business, how it can reform the nature of business in society. That's what we're really looking for."" Why profit should not be the only motive One thing on which he did agree with the Labour Party was the need to rewrite the Companies Act to specifically enshrine directors' duties to other stakeholders in law. Currently, the Act says that other stakeholders interests are subordinate to shareholders. Where he doesn't agree is in the demonisation of billionaires: ""It's not obscene to make a lot of money in the process of creating real solutions to the problems of the world."" But he hoped that such wealth would be recycled through foundations, for example, which could be the kind of long-term owners needed for the next generation of problem-solving companies. Not everyone agrees, of course, that the pursuit of profit, within the confines of the law and social norms, is bad. Matthew Lesh, from the Adam Smith Institute, says we should be cautious before we dismantle a mechanism that has produced innovation and a rise in absolute living standards. ""The profit motive has raised literally billions of people out of poverty by encouraging innovation and ensuring our finite resources are used exceedingly productively,"" he said. ""Mandating alternative purposes for business raises more issues than it solves. It removes the essential accountability between shareholders, whose investments are at risk, and corporate executives."" Some of these are age-old arguments between the Left and Right, but there is plenty of evidence that something fundamental is changing deep in the heart of capitalist economies. The Mars corporation, which has sales of $35bn, says it wants to let people know about its values Since 1978, the American Business Roundtable of top chief executives has periodically issued Principles of Corporate Governance. For the last 40 years, all of them have reiterated the orthodoxy that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders. Until now. In August it issued a new Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, signed by 181 chief executives who committed to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders - customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders. Even the famously private family that owns Mars has recently popped its head over the parapet to talk openly about the way it runs the chocolate-to-pet-food giant with annual sales of $35bn. Mars chairman Stephen Badger admits things are different now. ""We've never felt the need to be public but times have changed,"" he said. ""The talent [employees] really want to know what the company they work for, stands for. ""Equally important is that the magnitude of the challenges facing the world - climate change, poverty, biodiversity loss - these are issues that we care deeply about. ""We've got less than 10 years to get this right - incremental change is not enough. We are prepared to spend serious money on this and if that means lower profits, so be it. Whatever it takes to get the job done,"" The challenge to companies is threefold. Staff who want to believe in the company they work for, consumers who may boycott the products of companies that don't get it and, of course, politicians who may legislate, tax or nationalise them out of existence. But we should be cautious about announcing the death of shareholder power. Unilever - the Anglo-Dutch makers of Marmite, PG Tips and 400 other consumer brands - has long been admired for its enlightened approach to its societal impact. In 2017, it received a surprise takeover bid from Kraft Heinz. Its response was to accelerate the sale of some businesses, increase its dividend, cut costs by 12%, raise the amount of debt in the company and give a further â¬5bn to shareholders through share buybacks. Steps the then chief executive, Paul Polman, now says he would rather not have taken. ""Feel free to be responsible - but don't be complacent about the interests of your owners"" was the clear message and lesson learned. Alan Jope, the current Unilever chief executive, told the BBC that its focus on doing right by society and the environment was not out of fear of nationalisation, taxation or regulation, but out of fear that its products would be shunned by a new generation of consumers unless they got this stuff right. Is that doing the right thing for the wrong reason? Not really. Does it matter if it is? Probably not. Unilever's Mr Jope did have a supportive message for the Labour Party. When asked if he supported company law changes to discourage firms from placing shareholders above others, he gave a clipped and clear response: ""Yep."" One thing is certain. No matter who wins the UK election, you can expect to hear the word ""purpose"" a lot in the next few years.

"Intruder hunted over sex attack on boy in bedroomThe man, who was captured on CCTV, fled when the young boy told him he would phone police.London","Police want to trace this man who was seen running from the area after the assault A CCTV image of a man suspected of sexually assaulting a young boy in his bedroom has been issued by detectives. The Met Police was called to a home in The Greenway in Ickenham, west London, early on Saturday morning to reports an intruder had been inside the property. Officers said there was no sign of a break-in at the property but the man made his way into the boy's room and sexually assaulted him. The man fled when the child told him he would phone the police. Detectives described the suspect as white, slim, with short hair and a beard. He was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. The child, whose age has not been given in order to protect his identity, is being supported by specially trained officers. Police have released the image of a man they want to trace and asked for anyone who recognises the man, or who was in the area after midnight on Saturday, to contact the Met. No arrests have been made. Det Con Claire Field said: ""This matter has clearly caused a great deal of anguish to the boy's family. ""Police are very concerned and we are carrying out an extensive and well-resourced investigation. ""We are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who was seen running from the area shortly after the assault. It is vital that we speak to him to establish why he was in the vicinity.""

Doorstep scams 'linked to modern slavery',"The man said he walked for 10 days to escape his controllers A worker who came to Britain has said he was bartered between criminals and then used to work on doorstep scams. The man said he was beaten, threatened and forced into work in return for tobacco, alcohol and bread and butter. National Trading Standards (NTS), the frontline UK consumer protection body, said this was an example of modern slavery behind traditional scams. It urged consumers to be aware of home improvement scams, as well as alert to the individuals who may be involved. Old scams, new tricks as fraudsters adapt Conned out of my life savings, then 'failed' by police The slavery victim, who has not been named, told NTS he was never paid but was ""totally powerless"" as the criminals took his passport, ID and money. ""We would fix up houses, do gardening, everything, house to house,"" he said. ""I had to work from the early morning until very, very late, seven days a week. ""I was sold, from person to person - bartered for right in front of my face. I heard one man say I wasn't even worth Â£300. I felt worthless."" Eventually, he said he walked for 10 days to get away from the slavemasters, and was helped by charity Hope for Justice. NTS, which was set up by the government in 2012, said gangs targeted vulnerable young men from deprived areas. Many were alcohol or drug dependent. Lord Toby Harris, who chairs NTS, said: ""The doorstep scammer is not a lovable rogue. Often behind the person who turns up at your door offering cut-price services is a serious criminal. ""Not only are they happy to rip off older people, those living on their own, and indeed anyone who is taken in by their patter, but they may also be exploiting and even enslaving vulnerable people to help them carry out their crimes."" He said that consumers needed to be aware that many of the scams that occurred were modern versions of traditional scams. Some of the biggest emerging threats include: The sale via overseas call centres of unproven or untested health and diet supplements The exploitation of internet connected devices Counterfeit, unsafe or stolen goods being sold quickly to time-pressed consumers via social media Criminals gaming search engines to get copycat technical support adverts, which are actually scams, to the top of the list of results Door-to-door scams related to solar panels and home insulation are also proving popular for rogue traders, trading standards officers said.

"Dead Thai deer had 7kg of rubbish in stomachAmong the items found in the deer's stomach were instant coffee sachets, rubber gloves and a towel.","The 10-year-old deer was found dead with various items inside its stomach A wild deer which died at a national park in northern Thailand was found to have 7kg (15 lbs) of rubbish inside its stomach, say officials. Men's underwear, plastic bags, instant coffee sachets and parts of plastic rope were among the things found inside the male deer's stomach. A Khun Sathan National Park official said the deer had been eating plastic for a ""long time"" before it died. Earlier this year, a baby dugong in Thailand died after eating plastic. Mariam the dugong won hearts in Thailand after photos of her rescue went viral.But she died just months after, with an autopsy showing that plastic had caused obstructions in her stomach. On 25 November, an officer who was on patrol found the 10-year-old male deer in the Khun Sathan National Park in the northern district of Na Noi. Also found in its stomach were rubber gloves, instant noodles and a small towel. ""We believed it had been eating those plastics for a long time before it died,"" Kriangsak Thanompun, a director at the National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department toldBBC News Thai. ""Officials [believe] the plastics had blocked up its alimentary canal [but a] further investigation [will be] launched."" Some 7kg of rubbish was found inside the deer Plastic bags and food waste were among the items found On social media, many criticised park-goers who had littered. ""When you go into a national park, take your rubbish back. Have some responsibility,"" one comment on Facebook said. Another said it would be hard to get people to pick up after themselves. ""This is something that has to be taught and implemented since a young age. By the time they are adults, it is hard [to change],"" another said. According to Mr Kriangsak, a ""three-phase plan"" would be put in place, aimed at getting local people to collect plastics and other rubbish in the national park area. The plan will also look into setting up a committee to deal with waste management and eventually, aim to educate the public on litter prevention.

UK set for 'active' role at European space meeting,"Europe is building a big network of Earth observing satellites called the Sentinels It now looks highly likely that the UK will increase its subscription to the European Space Agency. For the past week the long-promised uplift in the country's membership fee had appeared extremely doubtful. Such a reversal would have threatened leadership roles in a number of space missions and denied British industry some lucrative R&D contracts. But the UK government indicated to Esa late on Tuesday that it was ready to move forward with negotiations. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said: ""The UK has a world-leading space industry. As a founding member and one of the main contributors to the European Space Agency, we have sent a UK delegation to the ministerial conference to participate actively in discussions."" It hasn't been confirmed officially, but the BBC understands the UK is set to increase its â¬355m (Â£305m) annual subscription by ""more than 15%"". Europe keen to demonstrate Moon ambitions 'Rosalind Franklin' Mars rover assembly completed To the Moon and beyond: The future of exploration Subscriptions turn into R&D investments that keep Europe globally competitive The negotiations here in the Spanish city of Seville should see Esa's 22 member states approve an overall package of programmes worth â¬12.5bn (Â£10.7bn; $13.8bn). The final figure will be announced on Thursday. This money will cover a range of activities from new Earth observation satellites to joint missions to the Moon and Mars with the United States. Esa's triennial councils at ministerial level always start with some kind of drama, or argument, and this time it's been the UK's turn to be at the centre of it. The country has been saying for some months that it intended to spend more money in Esa. ""If Esa didn't exist, someone would have to invent it,"" Science Minister Chris Skidmore told this year's UK space conference. But it's understood the Prime Minister's office raised a number of questions last week about the appropriateness of an increased subscription, especially in an election period, and how the subscription would fit with a proposed national space programme. Artwork: Europe is supplying the back end to the Americans' Orion crewship Officials have spent recent days responding to those questions and, seemingly, reassuring No 10. UK industry has been lobbying hard for a subscription increase. Businesses say the R&D investments that flow back into the home space sector are vital to its global competitiveness. Britain builds a quarter of the world's big telecommunications satellites, for example. It's a major reason why Esa also bases its telecoms technical centre in Oxfordshire. Esa is often confused with the European Union. The organisations are actually separate legal entities and although the majority of their member states are the same, there is not a complete overlap. Agency officials are putting a broad package of proposals before member states to approve. Apart from the mandatory contributions to the agency's running costs and its general science programme, nations can pick and choose which projects to back and at what level. These are some of the areas member states can bid into. Human spaceflight and robotic exploration -This is a near-â¬2bn programme that aims to put Esa directly in the US space agency's (Nasa) grand plan to return astronauts to the Moon - known as Artemis. Member states are being asked to fully fund two propulsion units for the Americans' Orion crew capsules, and to pay to start development work on modules that would attach to a lunar space station called Gateway. Mars exploration also features in this budget line. Esa wants to bring rock samples from the planet back to Earth for study in the laboratory. Technologies for this include a surface rover that UK engineers would very much like to build. Earth observation -The package on the table is worth close to â¬2.4bn. The key component, valued at â¬1.4bn, would kick off the next phase of the Copernicus Earth observation programme. This is the most ambitious civil EO venture in the world and has seen a suite of satellites being launched in recent years to take a health check on the planet. The new phase, to be approved in Seville, would start the development of another six Sentinels, as they are known. Copernicus is a complex programme, not least because it's run in partnership with the EU. British industry believes it has the capacity to lead the R&D on two of the proposed Sentinels, but this will very much depend on how much money the UK puts on the table. Telecommunications -This â¬1.7bn programme has been very successful in the past in leveraging matching private investment. The programme supports the innovations that go into the next generation of commercial telecommunications satellites, which bounce TV, data, phone calls and broadband internet around the world. A key initiative here in Seville is an effort to develop technologies that can transmit information via laser light. Satellites generally make their connections through radio links, but these are becoming something of a bottleneck, especially when compared with the capabilities of the fibre infrastructure on the ground. If satellites could make greater use of optical transmissions, it would keep them on the innovation pace. Space transportation -This line is worth almost â¬2.7bn. This has been the most fractious area in past Councils as Europe has debated how best to meet the competitive challenge of the US rocket industry. Member state companies - principally in France, Germany and Italy - are working on two new vehicles, one called Ariane 6 and the other Vega C. They'd loft the smallest to the biggest satellites on the market. Crucially, the rockets should be much cheaper to build and operate. This meeting will approve funds to finish their development and to open new R&D projects to boost their future competitiveness. This would include technologies to allow a rocket to be used more than once. Space safety -This area, worth â¬600m, is all about protection - of space infrastructure and of Earth itself. On the list is a satellite known as Lagrange that would stare at the Sun to warn of outbursts that could damage other spacecraft and interfere with radio communications and power grids on Earth. This project is of primary interest to the UK. At the last ministerial council, member states rejected an asteroid encounter mission. The decision drew criticism because of our need to study objects that could hit - and devastate - the Earth. In response, Esa is putting forward a new mission for subscription called Hera. This small probe would visit a space rock that had previously been bombarded by a Nasa mission to learn more about how threatening asteroids could be deflected. Science programme -Valued at â¬2.8bn, all member states must contribute to the projects that fall under this umbrella. Science spending in the agency has been depressed at recent councils, receiving only ""flat cash"" settlements. This time, the intention is to give the budget area a stronger-than-inflation rise - at 10%. One of the benefits would be to provide the funding necessary to accelerate some exciting missions a decade from now. Esa is building a big X-ray space telescope called Athena and a constellation of satellites, known as Lisa, that could detect the gravitational waves from colliding black holes. It would be best if they could be flown at the same time to study events in the cosmos in tandem. The money promised at this council should make that possible. The BBC invited Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP and Brexit parties to give their positions on perhaps the most contentious area of the meeting - Copernicus, because of its large EU involvement. The Lib Dems said they were supporters of Copernicus and lauded the ""ground breaking technology"" it had brought to the near real-time detection of flooding; Labour said it too backed continued collaboration on what it called ""vital"" EU programmes. The SNP and the Brexit Party have yet to come back to us.

LiveLiveLatest from the election campaign trail7 minutes ago7 minutes ago Good morningGood morningLive Latest from the election campaign trail  7 minutes ago,"Nicola Sturgeon launches SNP election manifesto She accuses Boris Johnson of being ""dangerous and unfit for office"" Jeremy Corbyn produces documents he says prove the NHS is ""on the table"" is trade talks with the US In a BBC interview earlier, he conceded those on lower incomes could pay more tax under Labour Boris Johnson apologises for Islamophobia in the Conservative Party Former Tory grandee Lord Heseltine campaigns with the Lib Dems and attacks the Tories' ""get Brexit done"" message The country goes to the polls on 12 December Paul Gribben and Alice Evans We are at the end of another busy day of the general election campaign. Here is a
recap of Wednesdayâs main events:   The Metro leads on the YouGov poll which claims the Conservatives will win a majority of 68 seats in the general election The Times says Mr Johnson is on course for a comfortable majority as a result of making gains at Labour's expense - based on the YouGov poll The FT reports a warning from the Resolution Foundation - that a new Conservative or Labour government would be likely to break its budgetary rules. The Guardian leads on the story we've been bringing you reaction to all day - a dossier released by the Labour Party which, it claims, is ""proof"" the Tories want to ""sell"" the NHS in a US-UK trade deal. Although different in style, the Mirror's front page isn't too different from the Guardian's in sentiment Refraining from a focus on the YouGov poll, the Telegraph's main story is Dominic Cummings' warning that the election is too close to call YouGov said it had interviewed around 100,000 people over the last seven days to research its MRP model. If the election were tomorrow it says the Lib Dems would win 13 constituencies (one more than they had before Parliament was dissolved), the SNP would win 43 (a gain of eight), while Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would remain static with four seats and one seat respectively. The YouGov model is seen as important by political observers because their last predictions called the hung
parliament and got 93% of seats correct. While this is impressive, thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether or not the 2017 result was a one-off
     success. The Conservatives will win the general election with a majority of 68 seats, according to a YouGov poll. Were the election held tomorrow, YouGov
projects the Tories would win 359 seats - 42 more than they took in 2017. Labour is on track to lose 51 MPs by securing 211 seats, the poll suggests. The poll suggests that the Conservatives would pick up seats from the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and the North. YouGov's MRP model was hotly anticipated because it is the method that first accurately projected a
hung parliament in 2017. Remember, there are caveats to this and any prediction should be treated with caution. The difference between this model and ordinary polling is that it applies national trends to constituencies, using demographics and previous results. This means it's more specific than national polling but will miss any truly local issues. And like other polls, the data can change between now and the
election. Expelled Conservative politician Lord Heseltine speaks to reporters at a Liberal Democrats press conference in central London Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP supporters at her party's manifesto launch in Glasgow An NHS worker poses with a dossier on US-UK trade talks. The papers were handed out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's event in London Big party policies were put to one side for a few minutes when Boris Johnson enjoyed a scone on a tour of Rodda""s Clotted Cream in Redruth, Cornwall Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons. They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected. Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos. The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month. Read our full story here. Some people on Twitter have
been speculating that a blog published earlier by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs
closest political adviser, had breached the civil service code and that he has since quit his role. Pre-election restrictions apply tomore than 440,000 civil servants working in the UK,external- staff who are politically impartial and work for government departments or agencies. In this period, they aren't allowed to do any work for ""political party purposes"". In Mr Cummings's 2,200-word posting, he says he has never been a member of a political party - but urges everyone who voted for the UK to leave the EU to support the Conservative Party in the next election. He also warns readers of a ""Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance"" in the event that the Tories fail to win a majority. However, the BBC has
confirmed with the Cabinet Office that he resigned as a special adviser at the start of the
campaign - along with all the other special advisers - as a formality. Stepping down at that point meant he would be able to campaign without breaking any rules. A Labour Party member in Plymouth has been criticised for sharing images of a postal vote on social media. Baz Ahmed tweeted a picture he was sent of a postal vote for Labour election candidate Luke Pollard, that revealed the voter's name and ballot paper number. The tweet has since been deleted. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport candidate Mr Pollardsaid on Twitter,externalhe advised his team and others ""not to share"" such pictures. Critics on social media said the move may have broken data protection and electoral laws. Read our full story here. What has happened so far today? Here is a mid-evening catch-up on the main events from today on the campaign trail. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Moving away from the topic of the NHS, Andrew Neil asks Justice Secretary Robert Buckland about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson has said anyone guilty of Islamophobia in his party would be ""out first bounce"". But Mr Neil accused Mr Buckland and his colleagues of allowing people to ""bounce back in"" again. Mr Buckland says: ""The record shows that we have been taking swift and immediate action to remove and suspend people who clearly have crossed that line into unacceptable, innapropriate and offensive comments."" But the BBC presenter challenges him, citing a recent example where a local councillor was thrown out of the party for Islamophobic comments made online - before being allowed back in again at a later date.  The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. Critics have said this does not go far enough, and that a review dealing solely with Islamophobia is what is needed. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Back to the question of what ""on the table"" actually means... The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Labour says the documents released earlier prove that this isn't the case. Mr Buckland says the six meetings were ""discussions of a preliminary nature"" about drug prices in a future US-UK trade deal. But he adds: ""That does not mean this is a negotiation based upon specific requirements. It's the sort of scoping discussion that happens in every free trade agreement. There's nothing unusual about this at all."" Andrew Neil pushes the Tory frontbencher, though, saying: ""There is nothing in these documents to say drug prices are not on the table."" Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Now it's the turn of Justice Secretary Robert Buckland in the hot seat. Presenter Andrew Neil begins by quoting International Trade Secretary Liz Truss when he spoke to her last week - she said the price the NHS pays for drugs was not on the table in US-UK trade talks. ""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today. Whissendine farmer Anthony Watchorn, who was running as an independent candidate, has died aged 69 after being taken to hospital yesterday. He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Younger peoplewere much less likely to votein the last two general elections compared to older people. So unsurprisingly, most voter registration adverts on Facebook were targeted at this under-35 age group. Read more here. Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

Corbyn concedes lower earners face Labour tax hike,"Jeremy Corbyn has admitted some of those on lower incomes could pay more tax under a future Labour government. The Labour leader had previously insisted only the richest 5% of taxpayers, those earning about Â£80,000 a year or more, would face tax rises. But he was forced to concede a plan to scrap a tax break for married couples would impact those earning less. Mr Corbyn argued in a BBC interview that those affected would benefit from a higher living wage. ""They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four-year-olds,"" he added. Live: SNP manifesto and other campaign news Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? IFS wrong on Labour tax plans, says John McDonnell Challenged on the policyin an interview with Andrew Neilon Tuesday night, Mr Corbyn conceded couples in receipt of the marriage allowance would no longer receive a reduction in tax if he wins power next month. ""They won't get the advantage, it's actually taking away Â£250,"" he said. The tax break was brought in by David Cameron in 2015 to promote marriage, with stay-at-home mothers and women who work part-time expected to be the main winners. It is available to married couples and civil partners with a combined income of under Â£62,500 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and up to Â£43,430 in Scotland. Themarriage allowance,externalis a tax relief for married couples and civil partners that allows one partner to transfer part of their personal allowance to the other. To benefit as a couple, the lower earner must normally have an income below their personal allowance, which is usually Â£12,500. It reduces the couple's tax bill by up to Â£250 a year. In the year to April 2019, 1.78 million people claimed the tax break, out of the 4.2 million couples eligible to receive it. When Labour published its general election manifesto last week it said there would be no increases in VAT, income tax or national insurance for 95% of taxpayers - those earning less than Â£80,000 - if it wins power on 12 December. The party is insisting that that is still the case and only a ""limited"" number of those on low incomes would be affected. Scrapping the marriage allowance was not in Labour's manifesto, but was included in an accompanying document, the so-calledgrey book,external, setting out how the party plans to pay for its spending commitments. Who should I vote for? Our policy guide,external A to Z: Our tool to help explain the election,external Which seats could turn the election?,external In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn repeated that only people who earned more than Â£80,000 a year would see a tax increase. He said scrapping the marriage allowance would be a ""step towards equality"" because ""those people that are cohabiting in a very happy family atmosphere and bringing up children do not get the benefit of that"". Defending the move, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said married and unmarried couples facing ""tough times"" would see their ""income boosted"" in other ways. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who had received the tax allowance would benefit from Labour's plan for 30 hours of free childcare for all two-to-four year olds and a Â£10 minimum wage. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Asked if the move amounted to a tax rise, he said: ""That allowance is going away but it is more than made up for in the extra resources they will be getting."" Tuesday evening's half-hour interview with Andrew Neil, whois also speaking to other party leadersduring the election, also saw Mr Corbyn struggle to explain how Labour's pledge to restore pensions to women born in the 1950s would be paid. The policy's estimated Â£58bn cost over five years would be paid for through government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. Mr Corbynalso declined to apologise to the UK Jewish communityafter the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed the ""poison"" of anti-Semitism within Labour was ""sanctioned from the very top"". Defending his leader's performance, Mr Burgon said Mr Corbyn had already apologised for the ""hurt caused"" to many Jewish people (in 2018). He said compensating the Waspi women was entirely justified - suggesting money had effectively been stolen from them. ""This amounts to theft and robbery of money these women paid into (their pension schemes) and money that they are entitled to,"" he said. The Conservatives said Labour was not able to answer how it would pay for their ""fantasy plans for the country"", which risked taxpayers ""footing the bill"".

"Dead Thai deer had 7kg of rubbish in stomachAmong the items found in the deer's stomach were instant coffee sachets, rubber gloves and a towel.Asia","The 10-year-old deer was found dead with various items inside its stomach A wild deer which died at a national park in northern Thailand was found to have 7kg (15 lbs) of rubbish inside its stomach, say officials. Men's underwear, plastic bags, instant coffee sachets and parts of plastic rope were among the things found inside the male deer's stomach. A Khun Sathan National Park official said the deer had been eating plastic for a ""long time"" before it died. Earlier this year, a baby dugong in Thailand died after eating plastic. Mariam the dugong won hearts in Thailand after photos of her rescue went viral.But she died just months after, with an autopsy showing that plastic had caused obstructions in her stomach. On 25 November, an officer who was on patrol found the 10-year-old male deer in the Khun Sathan National Park in the northern district of Na Noi. Also found in its stomach were rubber gloves, instant noodles and a small towel. ""We believed it had been eating those plastics for a long time before it died,"" Kriangsak Thanompun, a director at the National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department toldBBC News Thai. ""Officials [believe] the plastics had blocked up its alimentary canal [but a] further investigation [will be] launched."" Some 7kg of rubbish was found inside the deer Plastic bags and food waste were among the items found On social media, many criticised park-goers who had littered. ""When you go into a national park, take your rubbish back. Have some responsibility,"" one comment on Facebook said. Another said it would be hard to get people to pick up after themselves. ""This is something that has to be taught and implemented since a young age. By the time they are adults, it is hard [to change],"" another said. According to Mr Kriangsak, a ""three-phase plan"" would be put in place, aimed at getting local people to collect plastics and other rubbish in the national park area. The plan will also look into setting up a committee to deal with waste management and eventually, aim to educate the public on litter prevention. Turtles eat plastic they mistake for sea grass Dead whale had eaten 80 plastic bags Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic Thailand is a major user of plastic bags. Environmental group Greenpeace says that some 75 billion pieces of plastic bags are thrown away each year in Thailand.

Great auk: Humans hunted seabird to extinction,"""The great auk will always hold a place in my heart,"" Dr Jessica Thomas says. The Swansea-based scientist spent years piecing together an ancient DNA puzzle that suggests hunting by humans caused this giant seabird's demise. Dr Thomas studied bone and tissue samples from 41 museum specimens during a PhD at both Bangor and Copenhagen University. The findings paint a picture of how vulnerable even the most common species are to human exploitation. About 80cm (2ft 7in) tall, the stubby-winged and bulbous-billed great auks used to be found all across the north Atlantic -  from North America through Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and the UK. ""Being flightless, they were always targeted by local people for food and for their feathers,"" says Dr Thomas. ""But around 1500, when European seamen discovered the rich fishing grounds off Newfoundland, hunting intensified."" By about 1850, the great auk was extinct; the last two known specimens were hunted down by fishermen on Eldey Island, off the coast of Iceland. The songbird obsession that became an extinction crisis A third of tropical plants face extinction Five ways to climate proof the world Puffins are living relatives of great auks and are still hunted for their meat ""We looked for signatures of population decline [before 1500],"" Dr Thomas said. One of these signatures might be a lack of genetic diversity, suggesting individuals were inbreeding and the species, as a whole, was becoming vulnerable to disease or environmental change. ""But their genetic diversity was very high - all but two sequences we found were very different,"" Dr Thomas said. In fact, the genetic timeline Dr Thomas and her colleagues were able to create -published in the journal eLife,external- showed that, at the time the intensive great auk hunting began, the species was doing ""really well"". ""They weren't at risk of extinction at all,"" said Dr Thomas. ""It emphasises how vulnerable even the widespread and abundant species are to this intensive, localised pressure.""

LiveLiveLatest from the election campaign trail1 minute ago1 minute ago Good morningGood morningLive Latest from the election campaign trail  1 minute ago,"Nicola Sturgeon launches SNP election manifesto She accuses Boris Johnson of being ""dangerous and unfit for office"" Jeremy Corbyn produces documents he says prove the NHS is ""on the table"" is trade talks with the US In a BBC interview earlier, he conceded those on lower incomes could pay more tax under Labour Boris Johnson apologises for Islamophobia in the Conservative Party Former Tory grandee Lord Heseltine campaigns with the Lib Dems and attacks the Tories' ""get Brexit done"" message The country goes to the polls on 12 December Paul Gribben and Alice Evans We are at the end of another busy day of the general election campaign. Here is a
recap of Wednesdayâs main events:   The Metro leads on the YouGov poll which claims the Conservatives will win a majority of 68 seats in the general election The Times says Mr Johnson is on course for a comfortable majority as a result of making gains at Labour's expense - based on the YouGov poll The FT reports a warning from the Resolution Foundation - that a new Conservative or Labour government would be likely to break its budgetary rules. The Guardian leads on the story we've been bringing you reaction to all day - a dossier released by the Labour Party which, it claims, is ""proof"" the Tories want to ""sell"" the NHS in a US-UK trade deal. Although different in style, the Mirror's front page isn't too different from the Guardian's in sentiment Refraining from a focus on the YouGov poll, the Telegraph's main story is Dominic Cummings' warning that the election is too close to call YouGov said it had interviewed around 100,000 people over the last seven days to research its MRP model. If the election were tomorrow it says the Lib Dems would win 13 constituencies (one more than they had before Parliament was dissolved), the SNP would win 43 (a gain of eight), while Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would remain static with four seats and one seat respectively. The YouGov model is seen as important by political observers because their last predictions called the hung
parliament and got 93% of seats correct. While this is impressive, thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether or not the 2017 result was a one-off
     success. The Conservatives will win the general election with a majority of 68 seats, according to a YouGov poll. Were the election held tomorrow, YouGov
projects the Tories would win 359 seats - 42 more than they took in 2017. Labour is on track to lose 51 MPs by securing 211 seats, the poll suggests. The poll suggests that the Conservatives would pick up seats from the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and the North. YouGov's MRP model was hotly anticipated because it is the method that first accurately projected a
hung parliament in 2017. Remember, there are caveats to this and any prediction should be treated with caution. The difference between this model and ordinary polling is that it applies national trends to constituencies, using demographics and previous results. This means it's more specific than national polling but will miss any truly local issues. And like other polls, the data can change between now and the
election. Expelled Conservative politician Lord Heseltine speaks to reporters at a Liberal Democrats press conference in central London Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP supporters at her party's manifesto launch in Glasgow An NHS worker poses with a dossier on US-UK trade talks. The papers were handed out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's event in London Big party policies were put to one side for a few minutes when Boris Johnson enjoyed a scone on a tour of Rodda""s Clotted Cream in Redruth, Cornwall Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The emergence of these lengthy secret accounts of two years of US-UK trade discussions are important for several reasons. They are the clearest account of a deal that could be done and dusted in the Parliament that is about to be elected. Almost zero detail on the approach to such a deal has been outlined in manifestos. The documents show there could be widespread consequences, not just for the economy, but also important trade-offs to be made by the government elected next month. Read our full story here. Some people on Twitter have
been speculating that a blog published earlier by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs
closest political adviser, had breached the civil service code and that he has since quit his role. Pre-election restrictions apply tomore than 440,000 civil servants working in the UK,external- staff who are politically impartial and work for government departments or agencies. In this period, they aren't allowed to do any work for ""political party purposes"". In Mr Cummings's 2,200-word posting, he says he has never been a member of a political party - but urges everyone who voted for the UK to leave the EU to support the Conservative Party in the next election. He also warns readers of a ""Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance"" in the event that the Tories fail to win a majority. However, the BBC has
confirmed with the Cabinet Office that he resigned as a special adviser at the start of the
campaign - along with all the other special advisers - as a formality. Stepping down at that point meant he would be able to campaign without breaking any rules. A Labour Party member in Plymouth has been criticised for sharing images of a postal vote on social media. Baz Ahmed tweeted a picture he was sent of a postal vote for Labour election candidate Luke Pollard, that revealed the voter's name and ballot paper number. The tweet has since been deleted. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport candidate Mr Pollardsaid on Twitter,externalhe advised his team and others ""not to share"" such pictures. Critics on social media said the move may have broken data protection and electoral laws. Read our full story here. What has happened so far today? Here is a mid-evening catch-up on the main events from today on the campaign trail. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Moving away from the topic of the NHS, Andrew Neil asks Justice Secretary Robert Buckland about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson has said anyone guilty of Islamophobia in his party would be ""out first bounce"". But Mr Neil accused Mr Buckland and his colleagues of allowing people to ""bounce back in"" again. Mr Buckland says: ""The record shows that we have been taking swift and immediate action to remove and suspend people who clearly have crossed that line into unacceptable, innapropriate and offensive comments."" But the BBC presenter challenges him, citing a recent example where a local councillor was thrown out of the party for Islamophobic comments made online - before being allowed back in again at a later date.  The Conservatives have pledged to start an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party before the end of the year. Critics have said this does not go far enough, and that a review dealing solely with Islamophobia is what is needed. Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Back to the question of what ""on the table"" actually means... The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Labour says the documents released earlier prove that this isn't the case. Mr Buckland says the six meetings were ""discussions of a preliminary nature"" about drug prices in a future US-UK trade deal. But he adds: ""That does not mean this is a negotiation based upon specific requirements. It's the sort of scoping discussion that happens in every free trade agreement. There's nothing unusual about this at all."" Andrew Neil pushes the Tory frontbencher, though, saying: ""There is nothing in these documents to say drug prices are not on the table."" Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Now it's the turn of Justice Secretary Robert Buckland in the hot seat. Presenter Andrew Neil begins by quoting International Trade Secretary Liz Truss when he spoke to her last week - she said the price the NHS pays for drugs was not on the table in US-UK trade talks. ""That's not true, is it?"" Neil says. Mr Buckland disputes this. He says the papers released by Labour are ""a lot of noise and scaremongering about very little at all"". Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 Labourâs Barry
Gardiner quoted an annual extra cost of Â£26bn for the UK buying US drugs - but Andrew Neil says: âItâs ludicrous and you know that figure is scaremongering.â Mr Neil says the current total bill is actually Â£18bn for drugs from across the
world. But the Labour man says the point is that the government has said discussions with the US about the NHS are not going on - when the document, he claims, shows that the talks have indeed been happening. ""You're scaring people on the basis of no evidence in the document,"" Mr Neil says. But Mr Gardiner says that is a ""ridiculous thing to say"" because references to drugs companies in the papers implicitly link back to the NHS. ""Our NHS is under attack from big American drug companies,"" Mr Gardiner adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Neil ShowWednesdays from 7pm on BBC2 This video can not be played Gardiner on drugs costs and trade deal The BBC's Andrew Neil has Robert Buckland and Barry Gardiner on his show tonight. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is the Conservative candidate for South Swindon while Mr Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the Labour candidate for Brent North. Mr Neil presses Mr Gardiner straight away - asking him aboutLabour's release of government documentswhich it claims prove the NHS would be at risk in a US-UK trade deal. Mr Gardiner recalls Boris Johnson telling a TV audience there were no US-UK talks about drug price negotiations. The Labour frontbencher says there had been six meetings between officials about wording for a future trade deal. But the BBC presenter asks him for evidence Britain had agreed to give the US access to UK markets. The frontbencher said: âIf ministers are allowing civil servants to go off and negotiate this, either they are in control of it, in which [case] they know what is going on, or they are not in control of it."" Anthony Watchorn was running as an independent parliamentary candidate for Rutland and Melton Some sad news from the constituency of Rutland and Melton today. Whissendine farmer Anthony Watchorn, who was running as an independent candidate, has died aged 69 after being taken to hospital yesterday. He had been campaigning in the area and was due to attend a hustings on Monday with the other five candidates. Read the full story here. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There have been calls for politicians to dial down the rhetoric in the health debate and to avoid ""weaponising"" the NHS. The subject has been prominent in the election campaign and there is a widespread interest in understanding what is actually happening across the health service. Political claims, counter-claims and rows over statistics don't always help that understanding. Some voters might feel they would like to hear from clinicians and other frontline staff. But that won't be possible until after polling day because of a Cabinet Office policy known as ""purdah"". Read our full story here. Tom BartonPolitical correspondent in Westminster Earlier we brought you news that Tory political adviser Dominic Cummings had published a blogpost for the first time since he entered Downing Street. He has since changed his
blog after journalists highlighted the fact that it contradicted Tory attack
lines on Labour. Mr Cummings originally wrote that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, with the support
of the SNP he would âwaste 2021 on another Scottish referendumâ. But the Conservatives have
repeatedly warned of a âweak coalition government led by Corbynâs Labour and
two chaotic referendums next year"" - that is, 2020. Journalists, including BBC
political editor Laura Kuenssberg, highlighted the discrepancy â and a later
version of the blog changed the wording to suggest that âthereâll be another
Scottish referendum"". BBC digital elections reporter tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Younger peoplewere much less likely to votein the last two general elections compared to older people. So unsurprisingly, most voter registration adverts on Facebook were targeted at this under-35 age group. Read more here. Tom BartonBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson's closest political adviser,Dominic Cummings, has published a 2,200-word essay,externalon his personal website - the first time he's blogged since entering Downing Street. In the post he admits that despite serving under a Conservative prime minister, he is not a member of the Tory party. ""I have never been a member of any party"", he writes, adding that under David Cameron and Theresa May ""there were some big decisions about priorities that were wrong"". He also claims Boris Johnson promised him, and other members of the No 10 team, that he was ""determined to change the Conservative Party"". Mr Cummings writes that three days before becoming PM, Mr Johnson asked him to ""gather as many of the old Vote Leave team as possible and bring them to Downing Street to help deliver Brexit"". In an article which sees Mr Cummings warn about the dangers of voters not delivering a parliamentary majority for Mr Johnson, he also attacks some of the PM's political opponents - accusing ""powerful insiders"" of doing ""absolutely anything to keep their grip on power and money."" Radio 4 PM With the SNP launching its manifesto today, it's Radio 4 PM's turn to chew over the issues - with the party's Stewart Hosie. Mr Hosie insists Brexit has ""triggered the mandate"" to hold a second independence referendum, not least - he says - because of the way Scotland has been ""treated"" in the Brexit process with the SNP's arguments being ""dismissed"". He goes on to say that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in Scotland in the election, it would represent a further mandate to hold a referendum. In those circumstances, he doesn't think it's ""sustainable"" for any UK prime minister to say no to a referendum. Â© 2025 BBC.

Bad dreams 'help to control fear when awake',"If you had a bad dream last night, it might have a positive benefit - because research suggests being scared while asleep helps to control fear during the waking hours. University researchers in Switzerland and the United States examined how the brain responded to types of dream. They found bad dreams improved the effectiveness of the brain in reacting to frightening experiences when awake. But really terrifying nightmares were found to have a negative impact. The neuroscientists, from the University of Geneva, the University Hospitals of Geneva in Switzerland and the University of Wisconsin in the US, have suggested that dreams could be used as a form of therapy for anxiety disorders. The study looked at whether bad dreams - which are moderately frightening rather than excessively traumatic - might serve a useful purpose. How long does it really take to fall asleep? More sleep before a holiday reduces the risk of arguments With more than 250 electrodes attached to 18 subjects - and with another 89 people keeping diaries of their sleeping and dreaming - the researchers examined how the emotions experienced during dreams were connected with feelings when awake. The findings, published in Human Brain Mapping, showed that bad dreams helped people to ""react better to frightening situations"". When someone woke after a bad dream, the area of the brain that controlled their response to fear was found to be more effective. This suggested that bad dreams were a way of preparing people for fear in their waking lives. The greater the frequency of frightening dreams, the researchers found a higher level of activity in the area of the brain that manages fear. ""We were particularly interested in fear. What areas of our brain are activated when we're having bad dreams?"" said Lampros Perogamvros, a researcher in the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Geneva. The researchers said they found a ""very strong link between the emotions we feel in both sleep and wakefulness"", with bad dreams being a way of simulating frightening situations as a rehearsal for such experiences when awake. ""Dreams may be considered as a real training for our future reactions and may potentially prepare us to face real life dangers,"" said Mr Perogamvros. But there was a limit to how frightening a dream could be - because once a dream became a very upsetting nightmare the benefits were lost and instead it was likely to mean disrupted sleep and a ""negative impact"" that continued after waking. ""If a certain threshold of fear is exceeded in a dream, it loses its beneficial role as an emotional regulator,"" said Mr Perogamvros.

Rescuers search into the night after Albania quake,"Whole families perished in the quake hitting in the early hours of Tuesday Rescuers from several countries are scrambling to find survivors of the earthquake which hit Albania, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds more. Using sniffer dogs, they are sifting through rubble, 36 hours after the magnitude-6.4 tremor. Whole families have perished - and thousands are staying out in the open as powerful aftershocks hit. Most of the deaths occurred in the coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane, close to the epicentre. Tuesday's earthquake was the strongest to hit Albania in decades. A tearful defence minister said three children were among those killed, and while homes could be rebuilt the 28 people killed could not be brought back. The quake struck 34km (21 miles) north-west of the capital, Tirana, as people slept in their beds during the early hours. The latest aftershock - a magnitude 5.6 - is said to have damaged a building in Durres next to one where intense rescue efforts are under way. People have been housed in a football stadium in Durres More than 45 people have been pulled from the rubble and Prime Minister Edi Rama has promised that rescuers will ""continue to search patiently and thoroughly to the end"". He said all those affected would be sheltered in hotels until the government rebuilds their homes. A day of mourning is being observed in Albania and neighbouring Kosovo. Tuesday's quake caused considerable damage in Thumane and Durres, where entire blocks of flats collapsed. Local media report that at least 20 people are buried under the rubble. Teams from Italy, Greece, Romania, France, Switzerland, Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Israel are helping with the search efforts. Italian firefighters said they were working ""relentlessly"" at the site of a collapsed four-storey building in the Knet district of Durres, where six people are reported missing.

The largest deployment has come from the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF). Pictures show a large column of KSF vehicles arriving. The troops are specially trained to help with natural disasters. Kosovo has also sent police to Albania to help maintain law and order. This video can not be played Albania quake: Rescuers search for survivors In Thumane, rescuers are combing the rubble of a five-storey building. And in Durres, two three-year-old twin sisters are at the centre of one rescue effort - they are part of an extended family with many members missing. Hundreds of people spent the night in tents or cars, fearing another tremor. In Durres, a woman called Bukuri Morina and her family of 10 joined thousands of others to spend the night at the football stadium. ""We are afraid to go back to our apartment,"" she said. ""There are cracks all over and we are afraid that we will have the same destiny as people in Thumane."" All festivities coinciding with Albania's independence day on Thursday have been cancelled. The government has introduced a state of emergency - enabling more funds and security - in the worst affected areas. Thirty-year-old painter Diena Mecaj was pulled out alive from a six-storey block of flats in Durres, but could not survive her injuries. Two hours later the body of her daughter, aged eight, was brought out of the rubble. Diene Mecaj died in a six-storey building with her eight-year-old daughter Mecaj lost her husband in 2015, reports say. In Facebook posts she had described life without him as a challenge. Three members of the Gregu family perished in Thumane. Pellumb and Celike Gregu's bodies were recovered early on Wednesday, hours after their son, Saimir, died in hospital. Kristi Reci's body was recovered alongside that of her father, Eduart, in their collapsed apartment in Durres. She was a 25-year-old medical student in Tirana. Rescuers were still looking for her mother and brother. Two brothers from Kosovo are among the victims. Shemsedin Abazi, 32, and his 29-year-old brother Isa were staying Hotel Tropikal in Durres. When the earthquake struck, they phoned for help, but by the time rescuers pulled them out - some 15 hours later - they were already dead. The brothers had arrived in Durres only hours before the earthquake on a regular trip to put in a few days' work as mechanics. Like Albania, Kosovo was observing a day of mourning on Wednesday. Among the tragedies that took place as the quake struck, one man died in a car accident when the quake tore open parts of a road. Another man leapt from his balcony in panic but did not survive. As the rescue effort continued, a 31-year-old man from Thumane died in hospital on Wednesday and two other bodies were found in the rubble. The Balkans is in an area prone to seismic activity, lying close to a fault line between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates. Albania sits on a smaller, Adriatic tectonic plate.

"No apology from Corbyn over anti-Semitism claimsThe Labour leader says racism is a ""poison"" and he wants to work with all communities to eliminate it.Election 2019","This video can not be played WATCH: Jeremy Corbyn is pressed over his handling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has declined to apologise to the UK Jewish community after the chief rabbi criticised how the party deals with anti-Semitism claims. In aBBC interview with Andrew Neil, the Labour leader was asked four times whether he would like to apologise. Mr Corbyn said his government will protect ""every community against the abuse they receive"". Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed ""a new poison - sanctioned from the very top -has taken root"" in Labour. Following the interview, Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffithsaid Mr Corbyn should apologise, adding: ""We need to apologise to our colleagues in my own party who have been very upset and to the whole of the Jewish community."" Kuenssberg: Labour may struggle to move on from anti-Semitism row Muslim Council criticises Tories over Islamophobia No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. In an interview with Andrew Neil on BBC One, Mr Corbyn was asked four times whether he was going to apologise to the British Jewish community following the chief rabbi's claim that Labour was not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. Mr Corbyn replied: ""What I'll say is this I am determined that our society is safe for people of all faiths. ""I don't want anyone to be feeling insecure, in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains, or in any other form of life."" Mr Corbyn said racism ""is a total poison"", adding: ""I want to work with every community, to make sure it's eliminated. That is what my whole life has been about."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Rabbi Mirvis described Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour had ""investigated every single case"" of alleged anti-Semitism as a ""mendacious fiction"". Challenged about the rabbi's comment, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, he's not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that's mendacious."" The Labour leader said he was ""looking forward to having a discussion with him because I want to hear why he would say such a thing"". Mr Corbyn also insisted he had ""developed a much stronger process"" for dealing with allegations and had sanctioned and removed members who were judged to have made anti-Semitic statements. He added that anti-Semitism allegations ""didn't rise after I became leader"". ""Anti-Semitism is there in society, there are a very, very small number of people in the Labour Party that have been sanctioned as a result about their anti-Semitic behaviour,"" he told Andrew Neil. Speaking in the BBC Wales election TV debate, Ms Griffith, a senior member of Mr Corbyn's team, said the party's handling of anti-Semitism claims was ""a shame on us"" and ""we must absolutely put right"". She added: ""We have not been as effective as we should have been in dealing with this problem."" Mr Corbyn was also quizzed about his plan to get a ""credible"" Brexit deal with the EU and then be neutral in the referendum on the deal he has promised to hold within six months of taking power. Asked what he would do during the referendum campaign, he said: ""I will be the honest broker that will make sure the referendum is fair and make sure that the Leave deal is a credible one. ""That seems to me actually an adult and sensible way to go forward."" Mr Corbyn was also quizzed about Labour's plan to increase income tax on those earning more Â£85,000 a year to pay for better public services. He denied many of these people would leave the country under a Labour government, destroying the tax base the party would rely on to fund its plans. But he said they ""could and should"" pay more. ""They can see all around them the crumbling of public services and the terrible levels of child poverty that exist across Britain. ""There is no reason why they would have to leave the country and they shouldn't."" Mr Corbyn also said a Labour government would not borrow money ""willy-nilly"". ""What we are going to do is deal with the worst aspects of what's happened in austerity, the worst aspects of poverty in Britain,"" he said. On Labour's policy to compensate some of the women who lost out as a result of changes to the pension age, Mr Corbyn said the women were ""short-changed"" and a ""moral debt"" was owed. What is Labour offering to Waspi women? The campaign for compensation has been led by the group Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi). Labour says the policy would cost about Â£58bn, paid in instalments over five years. When pressed on where this money would come from, Mr Corbyn said it will be paid from government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. ""We will make sure they are compensated,"" he said.

Corbyn concedes lower earners face Labour tax hikeLabour previously claimed only the top 5% of earners would pay more to fund public services.Election 2019,"Jeremy Corbyn has admitted some of those on lower incomes could pay more tax under a future Labour government. The Labour leader had previously insisted only the richest 5% of taxpayers, those earning about Â£80,000 a year or more, would face tax rises. But he was forced to concede a plan to scrap a tax break for married couples would impact those earning less. Mr Corbyn argued in a BBC interview that those affected would benefit from a higher living wage. ""They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four-year-olds,"" he added. Live: SNP manifesto and other campaign news Does Â£80,000 put you in the top 5% of earners? IFS wrong on Labour tax plans, says John McDonnell Challenged on the policyin an interview with Andrew Neilon Tuesday night, Mr Corbyn conceded couples in receipt of the marriage allowance would no longer receive a reduction in tax if he wins power next month. ""They won't get the advantage, it's actually taking away Â£250,"" he said. The tax break was brought in by David Cameron in 2015 to promote marriage, with stay-at-home mothers and women who work part-time expected to be the main winners. It is available to married couples and civil partners with a combined income of under Â£62,500 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and up to Â£43,430 in Scotland. Themarriage allowance,externalis a tax relief for married couples and civil partners that allows one partner to transfer part of their personal allowance to the other. To benefit as a couple, the lower earner must normally have an income below their personal allowance, which is usually Â£12,500. It reduces the couple's tax bill by up to Â£250 a year. In the year to April 2019, 1.78 million people claimed the tax break, out of the 4.2 million couples eligible to receive it. When Labour published its general election manifesto last week it said there would be no increases in VAT, income tax or national insurance for 95% of taxpayers - those earning less than Â£80,000 - if it wins power on 12 December. The party is insisting that that is still the case and only a ""limited"" number of those on low incomes would be affected. Scrapping the marriage allowance was not in Labour's manifesto, but was included in an accompanying document, the so-calledgrey book,external, setting out how the party plans to pay for its spending commitments. Who should I vote for? Our policy guide,external A to Z: Our tool to help explain the election,external Which seats could turn the election?,external In the interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Corbyn repeated that only people who earned more than Â£80,000 a year would see a tax increase. He said scrapping the marriage allowance would be a ""step towards equality"" because ""those people that are cohabiting in a very happy family atmosphere and bringing up children do not get the benefit of that"". Defending the move, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said married and unmarried couples facing ""tough times"" would see their ""income boosted"" in other ways. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who had received the tax allowance would benefit from Labour's plan for 30 hours of free childcare for all two-to-four year olds and a Â£10 minimum wage. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says restoring Waspi pensions would be be paid for from government reserves and long-term borrowing. Asked if the move amounted to a tax rise, he said: ""That allowance is going away but it is more than made up for in the extra resources they will be getting."" Tuesday evening's half-hour interview with Andrew Neil, whois also speaking to other party leadersduring the election, also saw Mr Corbyn struggle to explain how Labour's pledge to restore pensions to women born in the 1950s would be paid. The policy's estimated Â£58bn cost over five years would be paid for through government reserves and, if necessary, borrowing, ""over some years"". He conceded that there were not sufficient funds in the government's reserves to cover the bill, but insisted the women deserved to be repaid. Mr Corbynalso declined to apologise to the UK Jewish communityafter the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis claimed the ""poison"" of anti-Semitism within Labour was ""sanctioned from the very top"". Defending his leader's performance, Mr Burgon said Mr Corbyn had already apologised for the ""hurt caused"" to many Jewish people (in 2018). He said compensating the Waspi women was entirely justified - suggesting money had effectively been stolen from them. ""This amounts to theft and robbery of money these women paid into (their pension schemes) and money that they are entitled to,"" he said. The Conservatives said Labour was not able to answer how it would pay for their ""fantasy plans for the country"", which risked taxpayers ""footing the bill"".

Twitter prepares for huge cull of inactive users,"Twitter said the accounts would start being deactivated from 11 December Twitter will begin deleting accounts that have been inactive for more than six months, unless they log in before an 11 December deadline. The cull will include users who stopped posting to the site because they died - unless someone with that person's account details is able to log-in. It is the first time Twitter has removed inactive accounts on such a large scale. The site said it was because users who do not log-in were unable to agree to its updated privacy policies. A spokeswoman also said it would improve credibility by removing dormant accounts from people's follower counts, something which may give a user an undue sense of importance. The first batch of deleted accounts will involve those registered outside of the US. The firm bases inactivity on whether or not a person has logged in at least once in the past six months. Twitter said the effort is not, as had been suggested by some users on the network, an attempt to free up usernames. That said, previously unavailable usernames will start coming up for grabs after the 11 December cut-off - though Twitter said it would be a gradual process, beginning with users outside of the US. In future, the firm said it would also look at accounts where people have logged in but don't ""do anything"" on the platform. A spokeswoman would not elaborate, other to say that the firm uses many signals to determine genuine human users - not just whether they interact with, or post, tweets. The site has sent out emails to users of accounts that will be affected by the deletions. The firm would not say how many current accounts fit the criteria, although it is expected to be in the many millions. It will send out more notice closures closer to the deadline. Affected users began receiving these emails from Tuesday The cull will not affect Twitter's reported user numbers, as the firm bases its usage level only on users who log-in at least once a day. According to its latest earnings report, from September, Twitter has 145m ""monetisable"" daily active users (users who come into contact with Twitter's advertising on a daily basis). ""As part of our commitment to serve the public conversation, weâre working to clean up inactive accounts to present more accurate, credible information people can trust across Twitter,"" the firm said about the upcoming account removals. ""Part of this effort is encouraging people to actively log-in and use Twitter when they register an account, as stated in our inactive accounts policy.â It means users who have died will have their accounts removed unless a loved one or other person is already in possession of their log-in details, and is able to sign in and accept Twitter's latest privacy policy. Twitter's current policy,externaloffers only deactivation of a dead person's account once a trusted third-party - a parent, for example - has proven their identity. However, the policy states that in no circumstances would Twitter grant access to the account, which would prevent deletion. The firm does not, unlike Facebook, offer a ""memorialisation"" option that freezes the account in place and disallows new interactions - a measure to prevent abuse. Since inactivity is based on logging in, not posting, bot accounts - such as those which automatically tweet news or alerts - would also come under the cull if the account owners do not log-in before the December deadline. So too would accounts set up specifically as an archive, such as@POTUS44,external, a collection of all the tweets made by President Barack Obama while in office. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

First bodies of UK truck victims arrive in Vietnam,"Ambulances will take the victims' bodies to their homes The bodies of 16 Vietnamese people who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in the UK have arrived back in Vietnam. They were among 39 migrants - eight women and 31 males, including two boys aged 15 - found in Essex on 23 October. The bodies were flown to Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport, and will be taken by ambulance to their family homes. Investigations are under way in both the UK and Vietnam, anda lorry driver has admitted plotting to assist illegal immigration. ""We have been waiting for this moment for a very long time. We will organise the funeral as soon as he's returned,"" said Vo Van Binh, the father of one victim, Vo Van Linh. Speaking to AFP from Ha Tinh province, he said the family were ""very sad, but happy as finally my son is back"". The bodies of the remaining victims will be repatriated in the coming days, though a date has not been confirmed. The remains arrived in Hanoi early on Wednesday Repatriation of each body will cost each of the victims' families more than 66.2m Vietnamese dong ($2,856; Â£2,204), according to the vice minister of foreign affairs. The Vietnamese government had offered loans to relatives, though some have said this will only add to the debts they incurred by helping their relatives make the journey to the UK. Several Vietnamese organisations have helped to raise money for the families of the victims.More than $110,000 has now been crowdfundedto help support the families. Pham Thi Tra My was identified as one of the victims On 23 October, police found the bodies at the back of a refrigerated lorry in the town of Grays in Essex, eastern England.

Sturgeon pledges to 'protect Scotland from Tories',"This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded the PM Boris Johnson 'dangerous' Nicola Sturgeon has launched the SNP election manifesto with a pledge to ""escape Brexit and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". The manifesto says that the SNP winning the most seats in Scotland would send a ""clear"" message that an independence referendum must be held next year. Ms Sturgeon said the country faced a ""fundamental question"" over who should decide its future. And she called for a big increase in NHS funding across the UK. The SNP won 35 seats at the last general election in 2017, making it the third biggest party in the UK Parliament, and it hopes to hold the balance of power if there is a hung parliament after the forthcoming election. Ms Sturgeon says she is open to forming a ""progressive alliance"" with other parties after the election, but has ruled out doing a deal with the Conservatives or entering into a formal coalition with Labour. SNP manifesto: Key policies explained Read the full SNP manifesto,external Among the key pledges in the party's election manifesto are: A second referendum on Scottish independence next year Another referendum on EU membership, or the revocation of Article 50 if it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit To call on the UK government to match Scottish per capita NHS spending, which will also deliver increased funding for Scotland Demand an end to austerity and press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy To call for the UK government to devolve powers over drug policy to the Scottish Parliament To press for the devolution of employment law To also seek the devolution of immigration powers so that Scotland can have a ""migration system that works for our economy and society"" Scrap the UK's Trident nuclear missile system An additional 12 weeks of parental leave which would be ring fenced for fathers to take A proposal for a NHS Protection Act to guarantee that the health service will not be used as a ""bargaining trip"" in future trade deals A plan to ring-fence oil and gas revenues to pay for climate change measures. At-a-glance: The SNP manifesto Ms Sturgeon accused the main Westminster parties of delivering ""constant chaos"" since the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scottish voters choose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. And she claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""dangerous and unfit for office"" and that his proposed Brexit deal would be a ""nightmare"" for Scotland. This video can not be played General election 2019: What's in the SNP's manifesto? She told the manifesto launch event in Glasgow: ""A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, It is a vote to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands, and it is a vote to deprive Boris Johnson's Conservative Party of a majority. ""The reality of Westminster control over Scotland is this: a right-wing Tory government Scotland didn't vote for and a prime minister in Boris Johnson who is dangerous and unfit for office."" Mr Johnson has alreadyruled out granting the formal consentthat Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says would be needed to ensure any independence referendum was legal. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would oppose a referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - but the party says it would not oppose one if there is a pro-independence majority after the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. But Ms Sturgeon said the decision on if and when a referendum is held should be one for the ""people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament"". She added: ""The democratically-elected Scottish Parliament has agreed the people should be given a choice over their future. An unelected Tory Westminster government has no right to overturn that decision. ""So an SNP victory in this election would be a clear instruction from the people of Scotland to respect Scottish democracy. ""There must be no Westminster veto over the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" Boris Johnson has given a ""cast iron guarantee"" that he would reject any request for consent to hold indyref2 if he wins the election And despite Mr Johnson's campaign pledge to ""get Brexit done"", Ms Sturgeon warned it was ""nowhere near done"" and predicted that Brexit would dominate Westminster politics for years to come. She said: ""The Tories have barely got going - they haven't even started trade talks. Because of Johnson's hard line position, there is every chance the UK will leave without a trade deal next year. That would be a catastrophe for jobs. ""And even if he somehow avoids that, his dream deal will be a nightmare for Scotland. ""It will take Scotland out of the single market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - and out of the Customs Union, the world's biggest trading block."" The SNP are not pretending that there is any chance they could form a government in Westminster, no matter how many seats they win. So Nicola Sturgeon admits these manifesto pledges can only be met if this election produces a hung parliament, if Labour are the largest party, if the SNP hold the balance of power, and if they can agree a deal with Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Sturgeon has already ruled out a formal coalition with Labour, saying she favours a ""progressive alliance"" with like-minded parties. In those circumstances the most important ask for Nicola Sturgeon is getting Mr Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum. Without that, any kind of deal would be unthinkable. Read more from Sarah here Ms Sturgeon also unveiled further details of the demands the SNP would make in return for supporting Labour if there is a hung parliament. The party says that central to this will be proposals to significantly increase funding for the NHS across the UK - with the SNP saying it is proposing more substantial funding increases than any other major party in the election. The SNP will demand that the next UK government raises per-head health spending south of the border to levels seen in Scotland. The party says spending is currently Â£136 per head higher north of the border, and that such a move would see NHS resource funding in England increase by more than Â£35bn between 2019/20 and 2023/24. This would also mean an additional Â£4bn in Barnett consequential for the Scottish NHS.

Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote.

Labour anti-Semitism row: A struggle to move on,"Allegations of anti-Semitism have rarely been far from the Labour Party since Jeremy Corbyn has been in charge. Those close to him say again and again that it is a source of pain and frustration to him, a man who has prided himself on campaigning against racism his whole political life. Figures within the party are adamant that while they were too slow initially to realise the scale of what was brewing, they have now speeded up the system of complaints and are doing as much as is humanly possible to rid the party of the problem. They point, too, to the many complaints that have been made about the Tories' attitude to Islamophobia, and the calls from the Muslim Council to hold a full investigation into what is going on there, just as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is undertaking a formal inquiry into the Labour Party. The prime minister is also under pressure to launch his party's own inquiry into racism against Muslims, which he promised to do during his leadership bid, but has now reneged on, committing only to a general inquiry into all forms of abuse and prejudice. No apology from Corbyn over anti-Semitism claims Muslim Council criticises Tories over Islamophobia No place for anti-Semitism within Labour - Corbyn But Labour may struggle to change the subject. That is not just because of the strength of thecriticisms from the Chief Rabbi. There are, of course, Jews who back the Labour leader and the party too. But Jeremy Corbyn's refusal to apologise for what has happened may underline the fear that some in his own party hold that he is somehow blind to some of the criticism. There was anger today that one of the candidates who sat on the platform alongside him had shared material online that talked of ""Zionist masters"", and is now standing to be a Labour MP, although she had apologised for what happened. Another candidate on the stage defended Ken Livingstone years ago and questioned the gravity of the party's issue with anti-Semitism last year. Lord Falconer, the Labour peer who was helping the party get to the bottom of what has been happening, said it was ""terrible"" and ""showed the most appalling insensitivity"". One of his shadow team, Nia Griffith, said on Tuesday night that the party should say sorry to Jewish Labour colleagues and to the wider community, and that she was ""very ashamed"" of what had happened. But in the interview with Andrew Neil, the Labour leader stuck resolutely to his formula that he abhors all forms of racism. He visibly means that. Yet many people watching may have felt it uncomfortable that a simple apology seemed to stick in his throat. You can watch the interviewon the BBC iPlayer here. The other problem for the Labour Party is that the action it says that it has taken firmly, and now speedily, has not brought a resolution. Labour has been struggling with this for more than three years. That is despite repeated and serious promises to sort it out. Inevitably, that raises questions, as we are about to enter the final fortnight of this campaign, about how capable the leadership is of getting to grips with tricky and sensitive issues.
