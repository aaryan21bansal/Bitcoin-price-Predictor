Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss,"This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens: ""We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system"" Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. He said there was a need to ""decisively answer"" how high quality care could be provided long-term. The Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care What are the problems with the social care system? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works. ""If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,"" he said. ""The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports."" He added: ""I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation. ""If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes. ""The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'. ""That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus."" The coronavirus crisis has placed many care homes under additional stress Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon. ""The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,"" Sir Keir said. ""I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility. ""The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a ""comprehensive action plan"" to support social care in England during the pandemic. ""We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,"" they added. ""We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future."" Cap on care costs considered before outbreak Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Adult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities. Unlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over Â£23,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. Services have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. In Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Political parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years. The Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation. However, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak. At December's election, the government pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. It has subsequently given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Do you work in a care home?

Thirteen UK universities 'facing insolvency',"Most universities have seen their finances harmed by the pandemic Thirteen universities face ""a very real prospect"" of insolvency following the coronavirus crisis unless they receive a government bailout, a study suggests. High-ranking universities with large numbers of international students face the largest immediate drop in income, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the least prestigious universities are at the greatest risk, says the IFS. The IFS does not name the universities, but says a targeted government bailout would be the most cost-effective plan. The fallout from Covid-19 ""poses a significant financial threat"" across UK higher education, with most institutions left with reduced net assets, saysthe analysis,external. They say the total size of the sector's losses is ""highly uncertain"" - anywhere between Â£3bn and Â£19bn, or between 7.5% and almost half the sector's annual income. The researchers' central estimate is an Â£11bn loss, amounting to a quarter of  the sector's annual income. NUS in 'mass action' for students hit by lockdown Should I go to university this year? Universities warn of going bust without extra cash Lockdown related losses include: fewer international student enrolments less income from student accommodation, conferences and catering losses on long-term investments In addition, universities which are running pension scheme deficits will see them widen during the pandemic as investments stagnate. But there are big variations between institutions, says the study. Universities with many international students which also have substantial pension obligations are often also higher-ranking institutions, with ""large financial buffers"" and the option of alleviating losses by admitting more UK-based students. But this behaviour could harm less selective universities, which could see their potential students recruited by higher-ranking institutions. Without significant redundancies, which would impact on teaching quality, universities are unlikely to be able to claw back much of the losses through cost savings, the researchers warn. Some universities went into the crisis with far stronger finances than others, they add. ""Our analysis shows it is not the universities with the greatest losses, but the institutions in the weakest financial positions before the crisis, that are at the greatest risk of insolvency,"" they conclude. The researchers do not name names but, under their central estimate, suggest 13 universities, out of the UK's 165 higher education institutions, would end up with negative reserves ""and thus may not be viable in the long run without a government bailout or debt restructuring"". Less selective universities may face tougher competition for UK-based students The analysis, which was funded by the Nuffield Foundation, suggests a targeted bailout aimed at ""keeping these institutions afloat could cost just Â£140m"". IFS research economist Elaine Drayton said a targeted bailout would be by far the cheapest option. ""However, rescuing failing institutions may weaken incentives for others to manage their finances prudently in future,"" she warned. ""General increases in research funding avoid this problem, but are unlikely to help the institutions that are most at risk, as few of them are research active."" The National Union of Students said the crisis had ""exposed many of the flaws inherent in running our education like a market"". ""When funding is so unstable, it's no wonder that our universities and the jobs of thousands of academic and support staff are now at risk,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are of course especially concerned about the risk to students that this instability poses."" The University and College Union's general secretary, Jo Grady, called on the government ""to step in and guarantee lost funding for universities so they can weather this crisis and lead our recovery on the other side"". ""We need a comprehensive support package that protects jobs, preserves our academic capacity and guarantees all universities' survival,"" said Dr Grady. In a statement, the Department for Education saida government package,externalannounced in May, allows UK universities to access business support and job retention schemes, while the sector will also benefit from the pulling forward of Â£2.6bn in tuition fee payments to ease cash flow problems. Additionally,research focused universities across the UK will see 80% of fees lost from international students covered by government,,externalalongside Â£280m in extra research funding. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said the body had been working closely with government onproposals to support universities,external. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the universities watchdog for England, urged all registered higher education providers to inform the Office for Students if they encountered financial difficulties. ""In these circumstances, we will be proactive in ensuring students' interests are protected, including helping make sure that students can find an appropriate course elsewhere should any provider close,"" she added.

UK hospitality industry calls for 'urgent' support,"""Urgent"" support is needed to prevent ""widespread devastation"", the hospitality sector has warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Around 120 hospitality and tourism bosses have signed an open letter calling for aid and investment. The industry wants to see VAT reduced, tax bills further deferred and some rent debt covered through grants. Bosses say parts of the sector will not survive because some businesses remain closed, despite the easing of lockdown. ""Hospitality businesses operate with very high fixed costs and labour costs are the only flexible point to absorb this suppressed demand,"" the letter said. ""Many parts of the late night and leisure economy, as well as activities such as events and conferencing in our hotels, have no provisional date for reopening and this is impacting confidence and undermining job security."" Labour is calling for the government to create a Â£1.7bn ""fightback fund"" to prevent firms in the hospitality industry and on High Streets from going under. It wants ministers to give councils more flexibility to tailor support for their local economies and better focus funds on struggling businesses, such as hotels and cafes in coastal communities, as well as conference centres and music venues in towns and cities. The Treasury said the government's job retention scheme had protected 9.2 million jobs, adding that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had announced a business rates holiday specifically for businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors. Coronavirus lockdown: People rush to town centres as pubs reopen Coronavirus: Restaurants call for more help as jobs 'at risk' Hotels plan to reopen with coronavirus protection measures Bosses claim that the hospitality and tourism industry have been hardest hit by the crisis, compared to other sectors. They also argue that the impact is likely to last longer than in other sectors, due to social distancing rules, restrictions on business events and lower demand from international tourists. ""Sales across the sector are expected to be 56% lower than last year, reducing revenues by Â£73.4bn and half of businesses do not expect to reach break even until the end of next year,"" the hospitality industry warned. The hospitality industry says it is confident it can recover and operate safely and responsibly, but it needs help from the government to get there Trade group UK Hospitality says it is ""confident"" that the industry can return to full strength and still be able to operate safely and responsibly, but it will require help from the government to enable businesses to ""restart and begin to recover"" over the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. To that end, bosses have outlined a set of recommendations for the government, which include: Automatically extending the deferral of all tax liabilities that are due in July Providing a grant to cover a proportion of rent debt during closure, reopening and recovery Temporarily reducing VAT to 5% for tourism services Extending furlough for hospitality businesses to protect jobs Doubling the employer National Insurance contributions threshold to protect a return to part-time work Extending the hospitality business rates holiday to March 2022 The hospitality industry stressed in the letter that the sector has a record of creating new jobs following a crisis, and that it can be trusted to do it again, with help from the government. ""In the decade that followed the financial crisis hospitality consistently created around one in six new jobs thanks in part to the VAT cuts and investment in youth employment and training introduced in the immediate aftermath,"" hospitality bosses wrote. ""We can do so again. Physical hospitality cannot be replicated digitally online, in the same way that some form of retail can be. We therefore urge you and your colleagues across government to work with us to stimulate demand and support the sector's recovery.""

'Crystal clear' drunk people will not keep distance,"This video can not be played Large crowds of people visited London's Soho district to celebrate pubs reopening It is ""crystal clear"" that drunk people are unable to socially distance, the chair of the Police Federation said as pubs reopened on Saturday. Ministers had urged caution ahead of hospitality venues reopening in England after three months of lockdown. John Apter dealt with ""naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks"" on shift in Southampton. But police thanked the majority of people for acting responsibly as they enjoyed the night out. 'It feels good to be free and have fun again' Lockdown locks go as hairdressers open Streets were packed in London's Soho district, with images showing revellers outside pubs into the early hours of Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said ""a small number"" of premises closed early following advice from officers due to crowding, but the force added that there were ""no significant issues"" in the capital. Devon and Cornwall Police received more than 1,000 reports, most of which were ""drink-related"". Bars on Hilton Street in Manchester's Northern Quarter set out tables for customers In north Nottinghamshire, four people were arrested and several pubs decided to close after alcohol related anti-social behaviour. While people were out in droves at thousands of venues, fears emergency services could be as busy as New Year's Eve appear not to have been realised. Friends embrace 'Super Saturday' as pubs and bars reopen What are the new rules in pubs? But Mr Apter, from the Police Federation, an association for police staff in England and Wales, said: ""What was crystal clear is that drunk people can't/won't socially distance. ""It was a busy night but the shift managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted."" Some streets in Soho, London, were closed to traffic Police officers were seen walking through heavy crowds in Soho Addressing concerns raised by Mr Apter, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people had largely acted responsibly, saying the ""vast majority of people are, I think, doing the right thing"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge: ""Overall I'm pleased with what happened yesterday, it was really good to see people out and about and very largely social distancing."" Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Pleasingly, we did not see last night the kind of scenes that people feared might be. It was the foolish few, but the sensible majority."" Rob Moore, paramedic at the West Midlands Ambulance Service, told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""really average"" night shift in his area. ""We were really prepared for a sudden upsurge in calls related to people being out drinking but it hasn't happened thankfully,"" he said. ""Hopefully it's a sign people have heeded the advice and had a sensible night."" Groups gather in Borough Market, London People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus, with chief medical officer for England Chris Whitty saying easinglockdown is not ""risk-free"". The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. A group sits outside a bar and restaurant in Whitby, after travelling from nearby Darlington Dr Chris Smith, a virologist from the University of Cambridge, said that the majority of people are ""responsible"", but urged caution, citing cities such as Leicester and Melbourne, which have imposed localised lockdowns. Where's next after Leicester? 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' All you need to know about the new measures ""I would remind people, have a look at what's going on around the world,"" Dr Smith told BBC Breakfast. ""We could easily lurch back in the wrong direction if we don't remain vigilant because this thing hasn't gone away. We've still got a lot of circulation of the virus in the country, it's just a lot lower than when we started."" In Leicester, streets werelargely deserted as pubs and other venues remain closedafter the city became the first to be subject to a local lockdown on Monday, following a spike in Covid-19 cases.

Virus crisis expected to 'level down' UK economy,"The coronavirus crisis could ""level down"" the UK economy with London and the South East expected to bounce back more quickly than Hull and Bradford. Sectors such as finance and construction will be worst affected by the pandemic, a report from the Social Market Foundation think tank warned. Initially, that means London and the South East would be worst hit, but other areas face a slower recovery. The Treasury said it was committed to ""levelling up"" every region of the UK. The worst-affected areas in the short-term: Camden and City of London Kingston, Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham Lambeth East Lancashire Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames Ealing Tower Hamlets Westminster Swindon West Essex ""After the financial crisis, London recovered quickly because of a concentration of jobs in banking and insurance,"" the Social Market Foundation (SMF) report said. ""Whilst these jobs will face the biggest initial blow from coronavirus, evidence suggests the capital is more economically resilient and the labour market will recover quicker than the rest of the country."" The struggle to contain Covid-19's economic hit Traineeships to triple as unemployment fears mount But that is not the case in areas where unemployment rates were above the UK's average of 3.8% last year, according to the SMF, a centrist think tank. It said those areas, which include Manchester and Peterborough, face the slowest recovery. The areas that will find it hardest to bounce back: Hull Bradford Walsall Manchester Peterborough Lambeth Thurrock Brent Redbridge and Waltham Forest Sandwell ""Policy makers need to recognise that national or even regional data can conceal the local realities of this recession and should not rely on it when making important decisions for the recovery from coronavirus,"" said Amy Norman from the SMF. ""The economic severity of coronavirus will be felt across many places, but we must remember that this recession does not occur in isolation,"" she said. ""Many people and places outside of the capital will be particularly vulnerable due to the lasting hardships of the past decade."" The report also found that young people were more vulnerable to the economic impacts of the virus crisis. It said people between the ages of 20 and 24 were least likely to work in sectors like education, health or public administration, which have seen fewer people furloughed or made redundant. ""Young people's jobs are most at risk, but a quarter of older workers also face job instability,"" Ms Norman said. ""Politicians have announced the guaranteed youth opportunity but are light on support for those in older categories who will find themselves out of work."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""As we recover from the outbreak we remain committed to levelling up every region and nation of the UK - helping ensure they return to growth, jobs and prosperity in a way that is safe. ""Alongside our generous package of economic support that has protected millions of jobs and businesses, we're supporting communities up and down the country. At Spring Budget 2020, we allocated more than Â£6bn for local transport in towns and cities across England, Â£5bn to support the rollout of the fastest broadband, and committed to a Â£2.5bn skills fund to help our communities thrive.""

Traineeships to triple as unemployment fears mount,"The government is pledging to provide 30,000 new traineeships to get young people in England into work, as fears about mounting unemployment increase. Traineeships provide classroom-based lessons in maths, English and CV writing, as well as up to 90 hours of unpaid work experience. Under the Â£111m scheme, firms in England will be given Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive Â£21m for similar schemes. The additional funding for traineeships is set to be announced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday when he will unveil an economic plan to deal with the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis. A traineeship is a course that includes a work placement It can last from six weeks up to six months Traineeships are aimed at 16 to 24-year-olds in England Trainees may complete a maximum of 240 hours of work experience over six months Providers should offer an interview for an apprenticeship or job, if available at the end of the scheme Employers are not required to pay trainees for a work placement, unlike apprenticeships where theminimum wage rate is Â£4.15 per hour.,external On an apprenticeship, a person is employed to do work while studying for a formal qualification, usually for one day a week, either at a college or training centre over a number of years. Source:Gov.uk website,external Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. As a result, companies with a presence across the UK have revealed thousands of staff cuts in the past week. ""Young people's employment prospects are expected to be disproportionately affected by the economic fallout of coronavirus,"" the Treasury said in a statement announcing plans to expand the traineeship programme. Traineeships are intended to get people into their first job after education. They last from six weeks to six months and they are open to people aged between 16 and 24. The struggle to contain Covid-19's economic hit UK businesses cut more than 12,000 jobs in two days Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact ""Expanding traineeships will be part of a wider package to support young people and to ensure they have the skills and training to go on to high quality, secure and fulfilling employment,"" the Treasury said. Employers must currently offer a minimum of 100 hours of work experience. But the Treasury statement refers to ""a high-quality work placement of 60 to 90 hours"", which could suggest a new, lesser, commitment for providers. The expanded scheme will be in place in England from September 2020. The Treasury said that three quarters of young people who completed a traineeship moved on to employment or further study within a year. In contrast, three quarters of 18-24 year-olds who are not in education, employment or training for three months will continue to be out of work and out of education for a full 12 months, according to government figures. The number of people starting traineeships has, however, been declining gradually, from a high of 24,100 in 2015-16 down to 14,900 in 2018,according to figures from the Department for Education.,external David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We know that young people get treated very badly in recessions and will be at the back of the queue for jobs. ""What we want is a whole range of actions that the government can take: put money into colleges to give them a chance, incentivise employers to take on trainees, but also take on apprenticeships as well.""

"'Crystal clear' drunk people will not keep distanceAs people in England enjoy their first night out in months, police voice fears about social distancing.UK","This video can not be played Large crowds of people visited London's Soho district to celebrate pubs reopening It is ""crystal clear"" that drunk people are unable to socially distance, the chair of the Police Federation said as pubs reopened on Saturday. Ministers had urged caution ahead of hospitality venues reopening in England after three months of lockdown. John Apter dealt with ""naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks"" on shift in Southampton. But police thanked the majority of people for acting responsibly as they enjoyed the night out. 'It feels good to be free and have fun again' Lockdown locks go as hairdressers open Streets were packed in London's Soho district, with images showing revellers outside pubs into the early hours of Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said ""a small number"" of premises closed early following advice from officers due to crowding, but the force added that there were ""no significant issues"" in the capital. Devon and Cornwall Police received more than 1,000 reports, most of which were ""drink-related"". Bars on Hilton Street in Manchester's Northern Quarter set out tables for customers In north Nottinghamshire, four people were arrested and several pubs decided to close after alcohol related anti-social behaviour. While people were out in droves at thousands of venues, fears emergency services could be as busy as New Year's Eve appear not to have been realised. Friends embrace 'Super Saturday' as pubs and bars reopen What are the new rules in pubs? But Mr Apter, from the Police Federation, an association for police staff in England and Wales, said: ""What was crystal clear is that drunk people can't/won't socially distance. ""It was a busy night but the shift managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted."" Some streets in Soho, London, were closed to traffic Police officers were seen walking through heavy crowds in Soho Addressing concerns raised by Mr Apter, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people had largely acted responsibly, saying the ""vast majority of people are, I think, doing the right thing"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge: ""Overall I'm pleased with what happened yesterday, it was really good to see people out and about and very largely social distancing."" Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Pleasingly, we did not see last night the kind of scenes that people feared might be. It was the foolish few, but the sensible majority."" Rob Moore, paramedic at the West Midlands Ambulance Service, told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""really average"" night shift in his area. ""We were really prepared for a sudden upsurge in calls related to people being out drinking but it hasn't happened thankfully,"" he said. ""Hopefully it's a sign people have heeded the advice and had a sensible night."" Groups gather in Borough Market, London People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus, with chief medical officer for England Chris Whitty saying easinglockdown is not ""risk-free"". The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. A group sits outside a bar and restaurant in Whitby, after travelling from nearby Darlington Dr Chris Smith, a virologist from the University of Cambridge, said that the majority of people are ""responsible"", but urged caution, citing cities such as Leicester and Melbourne, which have imposed localised lockdowns. Where's next after Leicester? 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' All you need to know about the new measures ""I would remind people, have a look at what's going on around the world,"" Dr Smith told BBC Breakfast. ""We could easily lurch back in the wrong direction if we don't remain vigilant because this thing hasn't gone away. We've still got a lot of circulation of the virus in the country, it's just a lot lower than when we started."" In Leicester, streets werelargely deserted as pubs and other venues remain closedafter the city became the first to be subject to a local lockdown on Monday, following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Restrictions on the hospitality sector remain in place inScotlandandWales, while pubs have been able to open inNorthern Irelandsince Friday. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Is less than 2m safe? There were further lockdown restrictions relaxed in England on Saturday, including hairdressers and barber shops reopening. Long queues were seen outside barbersand there were midnight hairdressing appointments as people tamed their locks following months of closures. Other places now allowed to reopen in England include: Outdoor gyms, children's playgrounds and other outdoor spaces Libraries, community centres, bingo halls, cinemas, museums and galleries Funfairs, theme parks, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinks, social clubs and model villages Places of worship can openfor prayers and services and weddings are allowed to take place There were long queues outside a barbers in Clapham, south London People are also allowed to stay the night away from home for the first time since lockdown started, with campsites and holiday accommodation also reopening. Police in Dorset, Devon and Cornwall reported gridlock on the roads on Saturday - including a high volume of caravan owners heading to the coast.

Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future,"The Royal Court in London has a sign promising to be ""back soon"" Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures. The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk. Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton,has already gone into administration. Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up. Gillian Anderson starred in the Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding. ""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe."" He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made Â£90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September. After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains. Kwame Kwei-Armah and other staff have been making food deliveries The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says. ""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room. ""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre."" It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds. The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark. The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity. When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present. ""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says. ""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental."" The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May. Roy Alexander Weise hopes to ""give people moments of connection through art"" Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online. The five episodes ofConnect Fest,external, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week. ""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise. ""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do."" When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows. ""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities. ""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like. ""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"". He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in."" He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about ourwhyas artistic leaders."" The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world. ""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress."" Vicky Featherstone is concerned about the Royal Court's freelance workers When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. Buthowsoon? ""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says. ""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January."" It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging."" The Royal Court has put a filmed version of Cyprus Avenue online That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains. As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point. ""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported."" Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Theatres play a crucial role, she says, citingresearch,externalthat (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to Premier League football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft. Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People. ""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that."" This video can not be played Kim Cattrall told the BBC's Will Gompertz  ""we must be ever vigilant"" to protect regional theatres Pitlochry Festival Theatre has a 538-capacity auditorium Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week. But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay. One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead. ""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis."" That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says. Elizabeth Newman says she is ""working around the clock"" If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds. ""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers. ""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk."" The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says. ""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest."" Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government. ""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support."" Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June. In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector."" The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said. Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained. ""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued. ""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Theatre and music reopening plan 'meaningless',"A government roadmap for the return of live theatre and music has been met with calls for financial support and a timetable for reopening, with many dismissing the plan as inadequate. The five-step roadmap did not come with dates or monetary help attached. Actors' union Equity said,externalthat without investment to save jobs and venues, such guidance ""will be meaningless"". Birmingham Hippodrome and UK Theatre headFiona Allan said,externalit was ""of no practical benefit"" without a timescale. ""We need dates to work towards in order to plan properly or more jobs will be lost and more venues and companies close,"" she wrote. ""How is this not clear?"" Venues have been shut since March, with many warning that they will go out of business in the coming months without support. Mr Dowden said the roadmap ""provides a clear pathway back"" A government spokesperson said: ""We want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."" The arts have been supported by loans, grants, the furlough scheme and a Â£160m Arts Council England emergency package, and the government is ""considering ways in which we may be able to support it further on top of the unprecedented financial assistance we have already provided"", the spokesperson said. On Thursday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden published the five-stage plan for a ""phased return"", which will initially let performances take place outdoors, with indoors performances to follow later. Stage One- Rehearsal and training (no audiences and adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Two- Performances for broadcast and recording purposes (adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Three- Performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience Stage Four- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (but with a limited distanced audience indoors) Stage Five- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors) Mr Dowden said he wanted ""to raise the curtain on live performances"" as soon as possible, and that the roadmap ""provides a clear pathway back"". He said: ""I am determined to ensure the performing arts do not stay closed longer than is absolutely necessary to protect public health."" Sir Ian McKellen has given a ray of hope with the news that he will play Hamlet on stage Despite the lack of an official timetable, on Friday the producers of a musical based on Sleepless In Seattle went ahead and announced its world premiere at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre in London on 1 September. Sleepless, A Musical Romance will star Strictly Come Dancing winner Jay McGuiness and ex-Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh. Audiences will be socially distanced, temperature checked and required to wear masks. That news came a day after the announcement that Sir Ian McKellen will play Hamlet at the age of 81, in what was billed as the ""first major UK theatre production post-Covid to start rehearsals"". It will be staged at Theatre Royal Windsor, but no opening date has yet been announced. On Thursday, Leeds theatre company Slung Low staged a rare live performance with an audience. The children's show took place outdoors, with the performers on the back of a truck and families watching from tents. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PM joins nationwide clap on NHS anniversary,"This video can not be played People have been applauding the NHS in a range of locations The prime minister has joined a nationwide applause to pay tribute to NHS staff on the 72nd anniversary of the health service. The round of clapping was inspired by the weekly Clap for Carers initiative to thank key workers during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson said he celebrated with staff who ""quite simply, saved my life"" after he caught the virus. It is hoped the anniversary applause will become an annual tradition. Speaking after applauding outside Downing Street,Boris Johnson tweeted,external: ""Thank you to the whole NHS family and all of our carers for all you have done and continue to do to keep us well and cared for. ""In these past few months, indeed the past 72 years, you have represented the very best of this country. Our gratitude to you will be eternal."" He later added in a statement that he had marked the occasion with staff from St Thomas' Hospital, who cared for him when he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus in April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson took part in the clap from outside Downing Street A World War Two Spitfire plane with the words ""Thank U NHS"" painted on its underside tipped its wings above hospitals and the homes of fundraisers and volunteers, recognising the way people have supported the NHS and local communities during the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the celebrations were ""very personal for me"" as his late mother was a nurse and later relied on the health service when she became ill. He said: ""Many, many times she got gravely ill and it was the NHS that she turned to, and I remember as a boy, a teenager, being in high dependency units, in intensive care units, with my mum, watching nurses and other support staff keep my mum alive. ""They did that on more than one occasion - it's etched in my memory. For them, it was just the day job. They were doing that every day."" Leeds General Infirmary workers joined in to mark the health service's 72nd anniversary Members of the public came together - at a safe distance - to share the moment The National Health Service was launched on 5 July 1948, with the core principle that it is free at the point of delivery and is based on clinical need. As part of a weekend of anniversary events, UK landmarks were lit up blue in celebration and remembrance on Saturday. Downing Street, the Royal Albert Hall, Blackpool Tower, the Shard and the Wembley Arch were all illuminated and a minute's silence was held to remember those who have died during the pandemic. The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. People were also asked to place lights in their windows in a show of remembrance on Saturday night, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, lighting a candle in Canterbury Cathedral. A World War Two Spitfire plane flew over hospitals in Cambridge First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeonwas among officials joining in with the nationwide applauseon Sunday evening. In a video message she said the country was ""depending more than ever"" on its health and care workers, and thanked them ""from the bottom of my heart"". First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said NHS staff and social care workers were ""all heroes"". And Captain Tom Moore - who raised more than Â£32m for the health service by walking laps of his garden during lockdown - shareda video of himself clapping from his armchair,externalat home in Bedfordshire. The idea for Sunday's round of applause was inspired by the success of the weekly Clap for Carers, which saw households across the country show their appreciation for the NHS and other key workers during the lockdown. Earlier, Liverpool FC players applauded key workers ahead of their Premier League match against Aston Villa People clapped in Tredegar in south Wales - the birthplace of Aneurin Bevan, the health service's founding father Annemarie Plas, who founded the Clap for Carers initiative, joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside No 10 for the clap at 17:00 BST. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Sunday morning, she said: ""We have had this first part of the crisis, we don't know what lies ahead, so if we can have this one moment where we say thank you to each other and recharge our batteries for what may be a heavier time that lies ahead, then I think that is a beautiful moment.""

Arts venues get Â£1.57bn government lifeline,"This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do. But these institutions are not being helped.""

Meet Britain's unlikely key workers,"Matt Forward with his hawk in Trafalgar Square Whether it's nurses, carers or supermarket staff, key workers have rightly been hailed as heroes during lockdown. But behind the frontline of the pandemic there have been a huge number of people who have been busy doing essential jobs, asoutlined by the government,external. They include those working across the food and transport industries, people providing childcare, working in public service and the financial sector. They have been allowed to travel to work and send their children to school while the rest of us have been in lockdown. We spoke to some of them to find out how lockdown has been. Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles to the iconic square early two mornings a week. From 06:00, his ""little boy"" Lighten would fly around for a couple of hours - perching on Nelson's Column and the roof of the National Gallery. Harris hawks are social birds known for their co-operative manner His presence alone was enough to keep the pigeons away. ""If I was a pigeon and saw this beast flying around everywhere I wouldn't want to nest and get too comfy,"" he says. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Matt is new to the profession - he swapped his work as a plumber for the ""best job in the world"" a few months before lockdown. Matt has kept birds of prey all his life, but only recently started getting paid to work with them He saw a ""hell of a difference"" during lockdown, particularly because there were fewer people about, meaning there was less food waste for the pigeons to eat. ""People aren't dropping bags of crisps in Trafalgar Square anymore,"" he says, ""basically food isn't on a plate for them."" But because there is less food around, it's changed the behaviour of the pigeons. They seem a bit braver because they're hungrier, he says. After he finishes in Trafalgar Square, he takes his bird of prey to other places in the capital - London Stadium, museums, hotels. Matt says he loves that, despite coronavirus, people still come up to him to ask him about what he's doing. ""It's not as if I'm walking a dog down the road,"" he says. ""People show a lot of interest in it - that's one of the reasons I love it."" Lockdown has been ""a rollercoaster"" on Lunan Bay Farm, in Angus. Perched on the eastern coast of Scotland, the farm produces free range goat meat, honeyberries and other niche products. But a third of its business comes from asparagus - which has just a six-week season, running from early May until the middle of June. ""Covid hit us right before our asparagus started,"" says Jillian McEwan, who runs the farm with her husband Neil, a fifth-generation farmer. ""It is a high-intense time because it is such a short season."" As food producers, they also qualified as key workers, but were faced with a race to pick - and then sell - their asparagus right in the middle of lockdown. Neil and Jillian usually sell most of their asparagus to restaurants around Scotland ""We were able to booster our workforce with people who had been furloughed or had been made redundant,"" Jillian says. They ended up with a team of 10-15 pickers, who all had to be equipped with masks, gloves and aprons. The farm usually uses lightweight tractors in the asparagus fields, with pickers filling baskets on a platform pulled behind it. But to ensure social distancing they needed a much larger platform, meaning a heavier tractor was required. Jillian worries about the impact the heavier machinery could have in the coming years. ""By compacting the ground it will have an impact on next year's crop. So there were a lot of consequences of Covid for us."" The six-week asparagus season fell in the middle of lockdown The farm has 15 acres of asparagus and harvested 7,500kg in the six weeks from 4 May. But then came the challenge of finding new customers to sell it to while it was fresh. The 70-plus restaurants who usually take most of it were all closed. Instead they've turned to small farm shops and independent retailers. Much of their asparagus has been delivered to people as part of veg boxes. ""It actually proved to be quite successful for us. We could have actually sold three times the amount of asparagus we produced."" ""I have 62 volunteers that help me run manage the locks,"" says Alex Goode, site manager at Foxton Locks, in Leicestershire. ""I went down to zero at the start of lockdown."" As a key worker, the operation of the area became Alex's responsibility during lockdown. Just a handful of boats a day passed through Foxton Locks during lockdown Located on the Leicester section of the Grand Union Canal,Foxton boasts the longest and steepest set of staircase locks,externalin the UK. It is a set of 10 individual locks, split into two by a passing area. In the height of summer it can see 30-45 boats pass through every day. With all but essential travel stopped on the canal system at the beginning of lockdown, that number fell to between one and four a day. Yet boaters still needed to pass through the locks. ""People who are living on their boats, it is their house, they still needed to get to areas where they could empty their toilets and fill up their water. Other people needed to move around to get to sick relatives, or to get somewhere to moor for lockdown."" Working mainly from home, he created a next day booking system, where all the boats wanting to pass had to register for a set time the following day, giving Alex time to arrive, unlock the locks, and make sure coronavirus protocols were being stuck to by boaters. A team of more than 60 volunteers usually help to maintain and run the locks Alex would also perform a daily safety check to make sure there was no damage or vandalism to the lock - or to the tow path, where locals came for their daily permitted exercise. He says about 10-15 boats a day now pass through Foxton and he is looking forward to the canal volunteers returning at the beginning of July. ""It resembled something out of ET,"" says Caitlin Rehal. The 37-year-old specialist speech and language therapist is describing the personal protective equipment she had to wear to see a 102-year-old patient. Neither were suspected of having coronavirus, but such PPE is just one of the changes Caitlin has seen in her profession since the pandemic hit. ""It was almost impossible to engage with this patient while wearing all of this gear,"" she said. ""It was very hard to get her to know I was a person trying to speak to her. My impression was it was as if a bin was speaking to herâ¦ like something was talking but perhaps it shouldn't be."" Caitlin says she felt like she was wearing an ""ET"" outfit Caitlin says that as the PPE guidance has changed she hasn't been required to wear the ""ET"" outfit again - now a surgical mask, gloves and an apron are deemed suitable to see patients. As a specialist health key worker, she has continued to work at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Kent, during the pandemic, treating people struggling to communicate or swallow, which affects their eating and drinking. She says her team regularly sees patients who have had a brain injury, a fall, or those with dementia, Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis. And now Covid-19 - because it affects the respiratory system, it can have an impact on the way people swallow, she says. ""Overall we have had fewer patients but of those patients some of them are much higher risk. So it's been a bit of an adjustment,"" she says. It's also meant many of the patients her team treats have been younger than usual - aged in their 50s and 60s, rather than 70s and older. ""It's been a bit of an adjustment,"" says Caitlin But because she has asthma, Caitlin has been unable to work with many of those higher risk patients. She can't see anyone suspected of having coronavirus, even with elaborate PPE. She says she's grateful for the support of her colleagues when she felt ""she wasn't able to pull her weight"". ""Their understanding and appreciation of the work I was able to do, in lieu of being able to be on the high-risk wards with them, was very important for my emotional health in a very stressful period.""

PM joins nationwide clap on NHS anniversaryThe applause was inspired by the weekly Clap for Carers during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown.UK,"This video can not be played People have been applauding the NHS in a range of locations The prime minister has joined a nationwide applause to pay tribute to NHS staff on the 72nd anniversary of the health service. The round of clapping was inspired by the weekly Clap for Carers initiative to thank key workers during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson said he celebrated with staff who ""quite simply, saved my life"" after he caught the virus. It is hoped the anniversary applause will become an annual tradition. Speaking after applauding outside Downing Street,Boris Johnson tweeted,external: ""Thank you to the whole NHS family and all of our carers for all you have done and continue to do to keep us well and cared for. ""In these past few months, indeed the past 72 years, you have represented the very best of this country. Our gratitude to you will be eternal."" He later added in a statement that he had marked the occasion with staff from St Thomas' Hospital, who cared for him when he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus in April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson took part in the clap from outside Downing Street A World War Two Spitfire plane with the words ""Thank U NHS"" painted on its underside tipped its wings above hospitals and the homes of fundraisers and volunteers, recognising the way people have supported the NHS and local communities during the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the celebrations were ""very personal for me"" as his late mother was a nurse and later relied on the health service when she became ill. He said: ""Many, many times she got gravely ill and it was the NHS that she turned to, and I remember as a boy, a teenager, being in high dependency units, in intensive care units, with my mum, watching nurses and other support staff keep my mum alive. ""They did that on more than one occasion - it's etched in my memory. For them, it was just the day job. They were doing that every day."" Leeds General Infirmary workers joined in to mark the health service's 72nd anniversary Members of the public came together - at a safe distance - to share the moment The National Health Service was launched on 5 July 1948, with the core principle that it is free at the point of delivery and is based on clinical need. As part of a weekend of anniversary events, UK landmarks were lit up blue in celebration and remembrance on Saturday. Downing Street, the Royal Albert Hall, Blackpool Tower, the Shard and the Wembley Arch were all illuminated and a minute's silence was held to remember those who have died during the pandemic. The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. People were also asked to place lights in their windows in a show of remembrance on Saturday night, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, lighting a candle in Canterbury Cathedral. A World War Two Spitfire plane flew over hospitals in Cambridge First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeonwas among officials joining in with the nationwide applauseon Sunday evening. In a video message she said the country was ""depending more than ever"" on its health and care workers, and thanked them ""from the bottom of my heart"". First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said NHS staff and social care workers were ""all heroes"". And Captain Tom Moore - who raised more than Â£32m for the health service by walking laps of his garden during lockdown - shareda video of himself clapping from his armchair,externalat home in Bedfordshire. The idea for Sunday's round of applause was inspired by the success of the weekly Clap for Carers, which saw households across the country show their appreciation for the NHS and other key workers during the lockdown. Earlier, Liverpool FC players applauded key workers ahead of their Premier League match against Aston Villa People clapped in Tredegar in south Wales - the birthplace of Aneurin Bevan, the health service's founding father Annemarie Plas, who founded the Clap for Carers initiative, joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside No 10 for the clap at 17:00 BST.

What are the issues with social care?,"The care system helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, eating and medication. It is under pressure across the UK after past governments failed to reform or fund the council-run system properly. The pressure on social care during the coronavirus pandemic has led to renewed calls for government action. Onhis first day,externalas prime minister in 2019, Boris Johnson committed to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared"". But that plan has yet to be published - ministers say they will bring forward proposals in 2021. The system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region. Unlike the NHS, social care is means-tested. To receive help from your local authority, you must have a very high level of need and, in England and Northern Ireland, savings and assets of less than Â£23,250. In Wales, the threshold is Â£24,000 for non-residential care but Â£50,000 for residential care. Scotland operates a different system. Since 2010, the number of older people asking for council help has increased, but fewer now qualify for support in their own home or in care homes. The charity Age UK estimates there are 1.5 million people in England who need some help with day-to-day life, but do not receive it. Care home residents accounted for almost a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales up to January 2021, according to analysis by the PA news agency. Meanwhile, staff sickness and problems with personal protective equipment (PPE) supply increased pressure on the care system. The King's Fund says the pandemic has had a""devastating"" impact on the quality of care,external. Despite increasing demand, spending is still 3% lower than a decade ago. The money councils spend on social care comes from: A lump sum from central government that is used to pay for local public services (including social care) Funds raised by councils themselves, mainly from council tax Cuts to funding from central government led to a 17% fall in councils' spending on local public services between 2010 and 2019,according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. Local authorities have generally tried to protect their spending on adult social care, and the government has put in extra short-term money in recent years. The Local Government Association has said councils are under intense financial pressure, particularly since the start of the pandemic. The fees that local authorities pay for care, both in a person's own home or care homes, vary hugely depending on where you live. But across the country, the companies and charities who provide those services complain that councils are not covering the real cost of care. The squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system. In 2016, the competition regulatorestimated that in care homes,external, self-funders paid significantly more in fees than a local authority resident. Increasingly, care companies warn they would go out of business without private clients subsidising the system. Many of those self-funders will have ended up selling their family home to pay for their care. It is one of the reasons why many view the current system as unfair. The care systems across the UK are increasingly different in the way they operate, with England the least generous. For instance, in Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than Â£100 a week towards it. The systems in Northern Ireland and Scotland are different for support at home and residential care. In Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care. Scotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age. In Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than Â£18,000. Those with savings and assets of between Â£18,000 and Â£28,750 have to fund part of their care on a sliding scale, while people with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a Â£193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and Â£87.10 a week towards nursing care. These differences are reflected in the amount of money each nation spends per person on social care. There is no comparable data for Northern Ireland. The UK has an ageing population and the pressures on the care system will only increase. While living longer is considered a positive, many older people will develop health conditions which mean they need help with day-to-day life. For instance, the number of people with dementia in the UK is expected tomore than double to 1.6 million by 2040,external. The Alzheimer's Society has estimated that without local authority help, someone with dementia will typically have to spend Â£100,000 on the care they need. For a long timethey have called this a ""dementia tax"",external, as someone who develops the disease will have to cover their own costs until their assets are reduced to Â£23,250 - the threshold for qualifying for local authority help in England. But the growth in people needing care is fastest among working-age adults, rather than over-65s.  According to the Kings Fund,care for working-age adults is nearly twice as expensive as for older people,external. There is a knock-on effect for the health service if the care system is supporting fewer people, and only those with the highest needs. Someone struggling to cope on their own is more likely to have a fall or neglect themselves, meaning they end up in hospital emergency departments. Then, when they are ready to leave hospital, a lack of social care in the community can lead to them being stuck in a hospital bed for longer than required. This is why experts say the future of the NHS is tied to creating an effective social care system. Finding sufficient people willing to take on the challenging, yet rewarding, work of looking after people in their own home, or in care homes, is a continuing problem. Thelatest official data for England,externalshows there are 112,000 vacancies - over 7% of the social care workforce in England. Nearly a quarter of the 1.5 million people working in the sector are on zero-hours contracts (when employees are not guaranteed a full working week) and pay is often the minimum wage. Many argue that improving the pay and skills of the workforce is vital to encourage people to consider care work as a career. Increasingly, social care workers are carrying out tasks that would once have been done by trained nurses.

Refunds row beach fitness firm 'facing bankruptcy',"Teams of six - three men and three women - take part in a series of physical challenges An outdoor events firm has said it will not have the money to refund thousands of people over cancelled events. Devon-based Tribal Clash said it was ""facing bankruptcy"" after cancelling events in Devon, Portugal and the United States due to coronavirus. The events would have attracted about 450 teams of six who have paid a total of Â£270,000 in registration fees. The government said refunds should normally be given for cancellations of ""promised goods or services"". Tribal Clash, billed as the""world's most savage team competition"",externalwas founded in 2013 as a series of physical tasks on a beach with teams of six - three men and three women. It expanded in 2017 with competitions in Australia, Portugal and the US. About 100 teams who had entered the Devon and Portugal events this year had received refunds, said co-founder Andrew Barker. But there was ""no cash"" left from the ticket sales and ""we simply don't have and never have carried enough cash reserves to refund 100% of our customers"", he said. Andrew Barker: ""We are in a very precarious situation and we are literally on the brink of bankruptcy"" Some of the ticket money had been spent on subsidising previous events and investment in future events, while the rest had gone on overheads, paying hire companies, landowners and transport.

We are hearing from lots and lots of consumers who are really distressed by not being able to get hold of refunds. Consumers should get a full refund if they've paid for an event that isn't going ahead, depending on terms and conditions.

If you have paid with debit cards there is something called chargeback where your bank can claw money back from the recipient account.

"Factory staff 'work while awaiting test results'Workers are also getting abuse from residents over a local Covid-19 outbreak, BBC Wales is told.Wales politicsSocial care reform needed within a year - NHS bossSir Simon Stevens tells the BBC the Covid-19 crisis has shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the sector.UK Politics","Rowan Foods has been linked to 289 cases Employees at a food factory in Wrexham linked to a coronavirus outbreak have been working on site while they wait for their test results, BBC Wales has been told. One worker at Rowan Foods said he worked a ten hour shift between being tested and finding out he had Covid-19. As of Saturday, the site has been linked to 289 cases. In a statement Rowan Foods said the virus is ""not spreading within our premises"". Meanwhile Public Health Wales has apologised for delays in getting test results to employees. Workers at Rowan Foods have previously told the BBC they did not feel safe at the factory and it was""impossible"" to keep to a social distance on site. An employee who tested positive for the virus told the BBC'sPolitics Wales programmethat the company had told workers to ""come into work until you've got your test results"". ""I think it's really unsafe because you don't know. They may have [Covid-19] and they may be spreading it without knowledge."" He added that the company ""have been putting production first over the wellbeing of staff"". Many workers were reluctant to take time off, he said, as they would only be legally entitled to Â£94 a week in statutory sick pay. One worker tested on 22 June was still waiting for a result on 3 July, it was claimed The partner of another employee who was tested on 22 June claimed he was still waiting for his result on 3 July and was continuing to work in the meantime. She said the delay was ""making us nervous"", especially as she has underlying illnesses. ""We don't know if he's got it or not... I don't know if he's going to bring it to the house."" She also claimed that workers were getting abuse from the local community. ""It's not the workers' fault. They have to fear going into work. It's disgusting,"" she said. The company, in response to previous claims it was impossible to keep a social distance at the site, has said measures were put in place in March to protect workers. Rowan Foods, following the latest claims, said its ""primary concern throughout the pandemic has been the health and welfare of our staff and their families"". It added that the virus ""is not spreading within our premises"" and ""no one who has symptoms is allowed on to site"". ""Had our site been responsible for the outbreak and putting our staff at risk, we would have closed,"" the company said. ""Instead we are doing the right thing by our employees"". The company added that ""from 1 June, no one will be financially disadvantaged by doing the responsible thing and isolating where required"". Public Health Wales apologised for the speed of test results Public Health Wales said the organisation was aware that some employees had experienced delays in getting their test results ""and we apologise for this"". ""Those individuals who have tested positive, even if they have not yet received their results, will have been contacted by contact tracers as part of the Test, Trace, Protect process.

"Social care reform needed within a year - NHS bossSir Simon Stevens tells the BBC the Covid-19 crisis has shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the sector.UK Politics","This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens: ""We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system"" Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. He said there was a need to ""decisively answer"" how high quality care could be provided long-term. The Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care What are the problems with the social care system? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works. ""If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,"" he said. ""The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports."" He added: ""I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation. ""If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes. ""The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'. ""That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus."" The coronavirus crisis has placed many care homes under additional stress Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon. ""The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,"" Sir Keir said. ""I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility. ""The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a ""comprehensive action plan"" to support social care in England during the pandemic. ""We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,"" they added. ""We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future."" Cap on care costs considered before outbreak Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Adult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities. Unlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over Â£23,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. Services have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. In Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Political parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years. The Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation. However, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak. At December's election, the government pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. It has subsequently given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Do you work in a care home?

Ministers had urged caution ahead of hospitality venues reopening in England after three months of lockdown. John Apter dealt with ""naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks"" on shift in Southampton. But police thanked the majority of people for acting responsibly as they enjoyed the night out. 'It feels good to be free and have fun again' Lockdown locks go as hairdressers open Streets were packed in London's Soho district, with images showing revellers outside pubs into the early hours of Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said ""a small number"" of premises closed early following advice from officers due to crowding, but the force added that there were ""no significant issues"" in the capital. Devon and Cornwall Police received more than 1,000 reports, most of which were ""drink-related"". Bars on Hilton Street in Manchester's Northern Quarter set out tables for customers In north Nottinghamshire, four people were arrested and several pubs decided to close after alcohol related anti-social behaviour. While people were out in droves at thousands of venues, fears emergency services could be as busy as New Year's Eve appear not to have been realised. Friends embrace 'Super Saturday' as pubs and bars reopen What are the new rules in pubs? But Mr Apter, from the Police Federation, an association for police staff in England and Wales, said: ""What was crystal clear is that drunk people can't/won't socially distance. ""It was a busy night but the shift managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted."" Some streets in Soho, London, were closed to traffic Police officers were seen walking through heavy crowds in Soho Addressing concerns raised by Mr Apter, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people had largely acted responsibly, saying the ""vast majority of people are, I think, doing the right thing"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge: ""Overall I'm pleased with what happened yesterday, it was really good to see people out and about and very largely social distancing."" Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Pleasingly, we did not see last night the kind of scenes that people feared might be. It was the foolish few, but the sensible majority."" Rob Moore, paramedic at the West Midlands Ambulance Service, told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""really average"" night shift in his area. ""We were really prepared for a sudden upsurge in calls related to people being out drinking but it hasn't happened thankfully,"" he said. ""Hopefully it's a sign people have heeded the advice and had a sensible night."" Groups gather in Borough Market, London People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus, with chief medical officer for England Chris Whitty saying easinglockdown is not ""risk-free"". The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. A group sits outside a bar and restaurant in Whitby, after travelling from nearby Darlington Dr Chris Smith, a virologist from the University of Cambridge, said that the majority of people are ""responsible"", but urged caution, citing cities such as Leicester and Melbourne, which have imposed localised lockdowns. Where's next after Leicester? 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' All you need to know about the new measures ""I would remind people, have a look at what's going on around the world,"" Dr Smith told BBC Breakfast.

"Refunds row beach fitness firm 'facing bankruptcy'Tribal Clash says there is ""no cash"" after cancelling events around the world because of coronavirus.Devon","Teams of six - three men and three women - take part in a series of physical challenges An outdoor events firm has said it will not have the money to refund thousands of people over cancelled events.

The events would have attracted about 450 teams of six who have paid a total of Â£270,000 in registration fees.

Andrew Barker: ""We are in a very precarious situation and we are literally on the brink of bankruptcy"" Some of the ticket money had been spent on subsidising previous events and investment in future events, while the rest had gone on overheads, paying hire companies, landowners and transport.

Is this the end of office working?,"Nearly half of working adults in the UK have been working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak For many of us, our spare bedrooms or kitchen tables have become makeshift workplaces and a full return to the office seems a strange prospect. However, some employers have not only come to accept their staff working from home but have found it beneficial. ""The pandemic has forced businesses to do things differently - things will never go back to exactly how they were before,"" said Alun Jones of Hugh James. So what does the future hold for office working in Wales? Nearly half of all working adults (49%) in the UK are working from home due to coronavirus, according tothe latest figures,external. Before the pandemic, it was just 5%. If workers are to return to a central office, businesses are having to adapt to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Staggered shift patterns, re-organising workspaces, flexible hours, extra cleaning and even one-way systems and temperature checks are among the measures many of the biggest private companies in Wales are introducing. But some workers are unlikely to ever return. ""It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever,"" said Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research at the Royal Town Planning Institute. ""The CEO of Barclays said putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past. ""The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways."" For employees, the prospect of saving hours travelling to work every day has clear benefits for their wellbeing, work-life balance and wallets, as well as the climate. Principality Building Society said it would be a ""long time"" until its Cardiff headquarters was ever full again and has encouraged its 800 staff to work from home until September - and possibly beyond. Not all of Principality's 800 staff will return to work at the Cardiff headquarters Chief executive Julie-Ann Haines said the company has even seen benefits to home-working: ""We have proven that people can be just as effective, if not more so, working from home. ""The benefits including trading daily commute time for increased time at home, for exercise or for personal development, are helping colleagues to feel more satisfied, engaged and more productive. ""Increased remote working will also have a positive impact on ensuring there is less traffic on the roads, supporting the improvements the globe is seeing in reduced carbon usage."" Why some people work better from home Can I be made redundant when I'm furloughed? How our towns can meet social distancing rules Admiral is considering more ""flexible"" working for its 6,000 staff in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport Similarly, Hodge Bank is in ""no rush"" to return to its city centre head office. Staff have worked from home throughout lockdown and, in a recent wellbeing survey, told company bosses they would prefer to work from home more in the long term. ""We have used this time to challenge ourselves as a business and ask - how do we want to work in the future?"" said David Landen, interim chief executive. ""Now we've invested in the technology which allows our staff to work from home, we will continue to support colleagues to make the choice which best suits their lifestyle. ""For some, being in the office might be the right answer, while for others avoiding the commute and working around family commitments may work better."" Hugh James solicitors has introduced a one-way system within its head office Having invested in the technology to enable staff to work from home, many companies have said they can now offer greater flexibility. Hugh James Solicitors is adopting a ""cautious"" approach to reopening its workspaces with several measures to reduce numbers in its office. Can my boss force me to go to work? Our experts have answers ""We've embraced new technology more than ever during this time. This will continue, even when the office is fully back up and running,"" said Mr Jones. ""Remote meetings are set to stay. This is how the world does business now."" Working from home can present challenges, as Prof Robert Kelly discoveredduring a now-famous live interview from his home for BBC News which was interrupted by his wife and small children, earning him the nickname BBC Dad. Others havemissed the social interaction and creativity,externaloffered by working closer with colleagues. There is currently almost one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) of office space available in the Welsh capital. HMRC is due to move3,600 staff into a new regional tax office centre, described as the largest office leasing deal ever completed in Wales. A spokeswoman said HMRC remained ""committed"" to moving into the Â£100m building in February 2021 and was ""developing medium and long-term plans"" as to how staff will provide the service. Cardiff's Central Square project includes the new BBC Wales HQ and a transport interchange It is the latest phase in the Central Square development led by Rightacres. ""City centre locations will remain attractive to employers because people always need to collaborate to learn, to create, to innovate,"" said chief executive Paul McCarthy. ""How do large companies create a culture or train new members of staff if they don't come together? ""I think people like being in offices because they enjoy being part of a team as well as the social interaction. ""There had been a drive for people to work in smaller spaces. Computers are smaller so the desk space required is less and the density of people increased. That's likely to change and we could start getting some space back. ""So it will be interesting to see how different occupiers set different trends on how they use that space over the coming years. ""We need people to come back to work to bring city centres back to life because there's synergy between people working and cafes, sandwich bars, shops and pubs for socialising."" 90% of staff at Iceland's headquarters in Flintshire have been working from home It is not just in the country's capital that office working will look different. In Deeside, Flintshire, Iceland employs 700 people at its head office and anticipates there will be difficulties returning to full capacity. ""We have enhanced cleaning and all applicable social distancing measures in place to ensure that we provide a safe working environment for those who are unable to work from home,"" a spokesman said. Go Compare's office in Newport employs 268 people and has been largely empty throughout lockdown. It will offer staff across the company ""greater flexibility"" over working patterns when they begin to return to the office. ""We aren't planning to rush back to the office and the business is not at a disadvantage as a result,"" said Alex Currie, vice-president of people and talent at GoCo Group. ""We will continue to monitor official guidance and, as always, put our employees' health first.""

"'Crystal clear' drunk people will not keep distanceAs people in England enjoy their first night out in months, police voice fears about social distancing.","This video can not be played Large crowds of people visited London's Soho district to celebrate pubs reopening It is ""crystal clear"" that drunk people are unable to socially distance, the chair of the Police Federation said as pubs reopened on Saturday. Ministers had urged caution ahead of hospitality venues reopening in England after three months of lockdown. John Apter dealt with ""naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks"" on shift in Southampton. But police thanked the majority of people for acting responsibly as they enjoyed the night out. 'It feels good to be free and have fun again' Lockdown locks go as hairdressers open Streets were packed in London's Soho district, with images showing revellers outside pubs into the early hours of Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said ""a small number"" of premises closed early following advice from officers due to crowding, but the force added that there were ""no significant issues"" in the capital. Devon and Cornwall Police received more than 1,000 reports, most of which were ""drink-related"". Bars on Hilton Street in Manchester's Northern Quarter set out tables for customers In north Nottinghamshire, four people were arrested and several pubs decided to close after alcohol related anti-social behaviour. While people were out in droves at thousands of venues, fears emergency services could be as busy as New Year's Eve appear not to have been realised. Friends embrace 'Super Saturday' as pubs and bars reopen What are the new rules in pubs? But Mr Apter, from the Police Federation, an association for police staff in England and Wales, said: ""What was crystal clear is that drunk people can't/won't socially distance. ""It was a busy night but the shift managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted."" Some streets in Soho, London, were closed to traffic Police officers were seen walking through heavy crowds in Soho Addressing concerns raised by Mr Apter, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people had largely acted responsibly, saying the ""vast majority of people are, I think, doing the right thing"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge: ""Overall I'm pleased with what happened yesterday, it was really good to see people out and about and very largely social distancing."" Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Pleasingly, we did not see last night the kind of scenes that people feared might be. It was the foolish few, but the sensible majority."" Rob Moore, paramedic at the West Midlands Ambulance Service, told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""really average"" night shift in his area. ""We were really prepared for a sudden upsurge in calls related to people being out drinking but it hasn't happened thankfully,"" he said. ""Hopefully it's a sign people have heeded the advice and had a sensible night."" Groups gather in Borough Market, London People in England are still urged to stay 2m apart, but the new""one metre plus"" guidancemeans they can get closer if they use ""mitigation"" measures, such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus, with chief medical officer for England Chris Whitty saying easinglockdown is not ""risk-free"". The latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220. A group sits outside a bar and restaurant in Whitby, after travelling from nearby Darlington Dr Chris Smith, a virologist from the University of Cambridge, said that the majority of people are ""responsible"", but urged caution, citing cities such as Leicester and Melbourne, which have imposed localised lockdowns. Where's next after Leicester? 'We cannot in good conscience open the pub' All you need to know about the new measures ""I would remind people, have a look at what's going on around the world,"" Dr Smith told BBC Breakfast. ""We could easily lurch back in the wrong direction if we don't remain vigilant because this thing hasn't gone away. We've still got a lot of circulation of the virus in the country, it's just a lot lower than when we started."" In Leicester, streets werelargely deserted as pubs and other venues remain closedafter the city became the first to be subject to a local lockdown on Monday, following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Restrictions on the hospitality sector remain in place inScotlandandWales, while pubs have been able to open inNorthern Irelandsince Friday. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Is this the end of office working?Many big businesses are encouraging staff to carry on working from home, even after lockdown.","Nearly half of working adults in the UK have been working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak For many of us, our spare bedrooms or kitchen tables have become makeshift workplaces and a full return to the office seems a strange prospect. However, some employers have not only come to accept their staff working from home but have found it beneficial. ""The pandemic has forced businesses to do things differently - things will never go back to exactly how they were before,"" said Alun Jones of Hugh James. So what does the future hold for office working in Wales? Nearly half of all working adults (49%) in the UK are working from home due to coronavirus, according tothe latest figures,external. Before the pandemic, it was just 5%. If workers are to return to a central office, businesses are having to adapt to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Staggered shift patterns, re-organising workspaces, flexible hours, extra cleaning and even one-way systems and temperature checks are among the measures many of the biggest private companies in Wales are introducing. But some workers are unlikely to ever return. ""It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever,"" said Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research at the Royal Town Planning Institute. ""The CEO of Barclays said putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past. ""The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways."" For employees, the prospect of saving hours travelling to work every day has clear benefits for their wellbeing, work-life balance and wallets, as well as the climate. Principality Building Society said it would be a ""long time"" until its Cardiff headquarters was ever full again and has encouraged its 800 staff to work from home until September - and possibly beyond. Not all of Principality's 800 staff will return to work at the Cardiff headquarters Chief executive Julie-Ann Haines said the company has even seen benefits to home-working: ""We have proven that people can be just as effective, if not more so, working from home. ""The benefits including trading daily commute time for increased time at home, for exercise or for personal development, are helping colleagues to feel more satisfied, engaged and more productive. ""Increased remote working will also have a positive impact on ensuring there is less traffic on the roads, supporting the improvements the globe is seeing in reduced carbon usage."" Why some people work better from home Can I be made redundant when I'm furloughed? How our towns can meet social distancing rules Admiral is considering more ""flexible"" working for its 6,000 staff in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport Similarly, Hodge Bank is in ""no rush"" to return to its city centre head office. Staff have worked from home throughout lockdown and, in a recent wellbeing survey, told company bosses they would prefer to work from home more in the long term. ""We have used this time to challenge ourselves as a business and ask - how do we want to work in the future?"" said David Landen, interim chief executive. ""Now we've invested in the technology which allows our staff to work from home, we will continue to support colleagues to make the choice which best suits their lifestyle. ""For some, being in the office might be the right answer, while for others avoiding the commute and working around family commitments may work better."" Hugh James solicitors has introduced a one-way system within its head office Having invested in the technology to enable staff to work from home, many companies have said they can now offer greater flexibility. Hugh James Solicitors is adopting a ""cautious"" approach to reopening its workspaces with several measures to reduce numbers in its office. Can my boss force me to go to work? Our experts have answers ""We've embraced new technology more than ever during this time. This will continue, even when the office is fully back up and running,"" said Mr Jones. ""Remote meetings are set to stay. This is how the world does business now."" Working from home can present challenges, as Prof Robert Kelly discoveredduring a now-famous live interview from his home for BBC News which was interrupted by his wife and small children, earning him the nickname BBC Dad. Others havemissed the social interaction and creativity,externaloffered by working closer with colleagues. There is currently almost one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) of office space available in the Welsh capital. HMRC is due to move3,600 staff into a new regional tax office centre, described as the largest office leasing deal ever completed in Wales. A spokeswoman said HMRC remained ""committed"" to moving into the Â£100m building in February 2021 and was ""developing medium and long-term plans"" as to how staff will provide the service. Cardiff's Central Square project includes the new BBC Wales HQ and a transport interchange It is the latest phase in the Central Square development led by Rightacres. ""City centre locations will remain attractive to employers because people always need to collaborate to learn, to create, to innovate,"" said chief executive Paul McCarthy. ""How do large companies create a culture or train new members of staff if they don't come together? ""I think people like being in offices because they enjoy being part of a team as well as the social interaction. ""There had been a drive for people to work in smaller spaces. Computers are smaller so the desk space required is less and the density of people increased. That's likely to change and we could start getting some space back. ""So it will be interesting to see how different occupiers set different trends on how they use that space over the coming years. ""We need people to come back to work to bring city centres back to life because there's synergy between people working and cafes, sandwich bars, shops and pubs for socialising."" 90% of staff at Iceland's headquarters in Flintshire have been working from home It is not just in the country's capital that office working will look different. In Deeside, Flintshire, Iceland employs 700 people at its head office and anticipates there will be difficulties returning to full capacity. ""We have enhanced cleaning and all applicable social distancing measures in place to ensure that we provide a safe working environment for those who are unable to work from home,"" a spokesman said. Go Compare's office in Newport employs 268 people and has been largely empty throughout lockdown. It will offer staff across the company ""greater flexibility"" over working patterns when they begin to return to the office. ""We aren't planning to rush back to the office and the business is not at a disadvantage as a result,"" said Alex Currie, vice-president of people and talent at GoCo Group. ""We will continue to monitor official guidance and, as always, put our employees' health first.""

Lockdown Minecraft lesson recreates ancient tomb,"This video can not be played Bronze Age tomb recreated on Minecraft Take an archaeologist, a bored schoolgirl living through coronavirus lockdown, and a shared interest in exploring ancient tombs. The result? One of Wales' most important Bronze Age sites recreated - in the video game Minecraft. It is the achievement of Dr Ben Edwards, from Wrexham, and his daughter Bella, 11. Their models of Bryn Celli Ddu on Anglesey are now being shared with classrooms around the world. The models can be loaded into the block-building universe of Minecraft, and explored to learn more about both the site, Neolithic life and art. The burial mound dates back an estimated 5,000 years, with its so-called ""passage tomb"" whose entrance aligns perfectly with the sun at dawn on the summer solstice. The ancient and modern: Bryn Celli Ddu burial chamber for real - and in Minecraft The passage tomb aligns with the rising sun on the longest day of the year More recent excavations at the site, including some by the Manchester Metropolitan University archaeologist Dr Edwards himself, revealed the burial chamber was built as a ""henge"". Like Stonehenge, this was a ritual enclosure consisting of a bank around an inner ditch, enclosed in a circle of upright stones. Dr Edwards has used those digs,alongside work with researchers from the University of Central Lancashire and Wales' historical environment service Cadw, to painstakingly recreate Bryn Celli Ddu in the video game. It was then incorporated in the educational edition of Minecraft, which is used across the world to deliver lessons in anything from chemistry to computer coding. You can now add ancient Welsh history to that list. From cromlechs to cairns - Wales' ancient burial sites History of the world: The Bryn Celli Ddu stone Why the prehistoric built so many hill forts BBC Radio 3: New Generation Thinkers' Seren Griffiths on Bryn Celli Ddu ""I knew Bella had access to the education version of Minecraft at school here, near Wrexham, and I had access to it at my university. ""So it was always at the back of my mind for a while to do something in Minecraft,"" said Dr Edwards, who has worked on other more grown-up computer models of Bryn Celli Ddu in the past. ""It was never a massive priority, but then you are in lockdown, it's the Easter holidays, and you are home schooling. ""I just said to Bella: 'Shall we have a crack at this?'"" Real geographical data was used to map the virtual Minecraft site The game is famous for players being able to build almost anything out of graphic blocks, creating massive worlds and playgrounds. Though it may be a game, Dr Edwards took the approach to Bryn Celli Ddu seriously, and used actual geographical mapping data to recreate the landscape for the Minecraft models. It includes the tomb itself, as it may have appeared in the Bronze Age, and alongside it other burial mounds and pits discovered in the last few years. Rock art recovered from Bryn Celli Ddu is also represented in the game, alongside a model of what a Neolithic home may have looked like nearby. According to Dr Edwards, the hardest thing to build was not the burial mounds or house. ""It was planting the trees,"" he said. Each one had to be individually ""planted"" and grown by Bella and her father as part of the Minecraft world. ""Bella had to show me how to do a lot of things, because she uses it more than me,"" Dr Edwards confessed. In the end, she approved of the final version and said it was ""very realistic"". ""And she knows, because she used to come down to the excavations too,"" her father added. A Neolithic settlement was recreated as part of the digital game project Dr Ffion Reynolds, from Cadw, said it was exactly children such as Bella who would benefit from playing with the Minecraft model. ""We were looking for creative ways of providing people with a digital experience of Bryn Celli Ddu,"" said Dr Reynolds, who would normally be spending the summer months giving guided tours of the excavations to schools from the area. ""This was a way of continuing our relationship with those schools, and offering them a way of 'visiting' the site digitally."" Coronavirus restrictions mean Cadw's sites across Wales have been closed to the public, including Bryn Celli Ddu. It also meant, for the first time in years, those who celebrate the summer solstice were unable to gather at the burial mound to witness the dawn phenomenon there. ""However, it did allow us get access with a special camera crew, and we have been able to capture the sunrise there with 360-degree filming,"" Dr Reynolds added. She said Cadw hoped to make the footage available in the very near future, as well as reopening the site to visitors. Meanwhile, those with access to Minecraft at home or in school can now visit the site digitally - in safety. The Bryn Celli Ddu Minecraft world is free to download for the Minecraft Education version fromHwb - the Welsh Government's teaching resource site,external, and also from theManchester Centre for Public History and Heritage,external. And for those looking for a more serious experience, Dr Andrews and his colleagues are behindan augmented reality app available for Apple devices,external, which can guide visitors around the real site  - once it reopens.

Factory staff 'work while awaiting test results',"Rowan Foods has been linked to 289 cases Employees at a food factory in Wrexham linked to a coronavirus outbreak have been working on site while they wait for their test results, BBC Wales has been told. One worker at Rowan Foods said he worked a ten hour shift between being tested and finding out he had Covid-19. As of Saturday, the site has been linked to 289 cases. In a statement Rowan Foods said the virus is ""not spreading within our premises"". Meanwhile Public Health Wales has apologised for delays in getting test results to employees. Workers at Rowan Foods have previously told the BBC they did not feel safe at the factory and it was""impossible"" to keep to a social distance on site. An employee who tested positive for the virus told the BBC'sPolitics Wales programmethat the company had told workers to ""come into work until you've got your test results"". ""I think it's really unsafe because you don't know. They may have [Covid-19] and they may be spreading it without knowledge."" He added that the company ""have been putting production first over the wellbeing of staff"". Many workers were reluctant to take time off, he said, as they would only be legally entitled to Â£94 a week in statutory sick pay. One worker tested on 22 June was still waiting for a result on 3 July, it was claimed The partner of another employee who was tested on 22 June claimed he was still waiting for his result on 3 July and was continuing to work in the meantime. She said the delay was ""making us nervous"", especially as she has underlying illnesses. ""We don't know if he's got it or not... I don't know if he's going to bring it to the house."" She also claimed that workers were getting abuse from the local community. ""It's not the workers' fault. They have to fear going into work. It's disgusting,"" she said. The company, in response to previous claims it was impossible to keep a social distance at the site, has said measures were put in place in March to protect workers. Rowan Foods, following the latest claims, said its ""primary concern throughout the pandemic has been the health and welfare of our staff and their families"". It added that the virus ""is not spreading within our premises"" and ""no one who has symptoms is allowed on to site"". ""Had our site been responsible for the outbreak and putting our staff at risk, we would have closed,"" the company said. ""Instead we are doing the right thing by our employees"". The company added that ""from 1 June, no one will be financially disadvantaged by doing the responsible thing and isolating where required"". Public Health Wales apologised for the speed of test results Public Health Wales said the organisation was aware that some employees had experienced delays in getting their test results ""and we apologise for this"". ""Those individuals who have tested positive, even if they have not yet received their results, will have been contacted by contact tracers as part of the Test, Trace, Protect process. ""Colleagues at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board will be working over the next 48 hours to contact all individuals at Rowan Foods who have not yet received their results.""

Food factories given coronavirus guidelines,"2 Sisters food factory on Anglesey has suffered an outbreak of coronavirus Meat plants should consider staggered staff starts and gaps between carcasses on production lines to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to new Welsh Government guidelines. They emphasise social distancing and for staff to work and take breaks in small groups. ""Cohorts"" should be formed, particularly if staff live together and travel to work with each other. It said staff should not lose pay if they have to self-isolate. ""Self-isolation will not occur if pay is absent, causing infection to spread,"" the guidelines state. The guidelines have been issued following clusters of coronavirus cases at Welsh food factories - including 2 Sisters on Anglesey, Rowan Foods in Wrexham and Kepak in Merthyr Tydfil. Coronavirus cases at Rowan Foods, Wrexham, rise to 166 Coronavirus: Factory outbreaks 'linked to canteens and car shares' Coronavirus: Anglesey local lockdown 'possibility' for Llangefni factory outbreak They stress coronavirus is ""unlikely"" to be transmitted through food or packaging, and the guidelines are designed to protect plant workers. On Friday, the first minister confirmed 204 cases of coronavirus had been recorded among workers at 2 Sisters, while 166 cases had now been linked to Rowan Foods. Mark Drakeford said cases at Kepak appeared to be different to the other sites, as they were spread over several months. While he said there were 33 cases at that site, Public Health Wales said the verified figure was 29. It said Mr Drakeford was using numbers from the company. Rowan Foods in Wrexham says it has introduced screens and visors to keep staff safe Heather Lewis, of Public Health Wales, said no outbreak had been declared at the site, but investigations were ongoing. ""HSE officers were satisfied that Kepak Merthyr are taking all reasonably practicable measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within the workforce,"" she said. Rowan Foods said it had also been visited by the HSE and that this went ""well"". It said ""no enforceable action"" was taken. ""We have no serious issues which need addressing and we continue to comply with the law,"" a spokesman said. 75 chicken plant staff test positive for Covid-19 Coronavirus outbreak meat factory reopens 200 Covid-19 cases at Welsh meat plant outbreak 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Factory staff 'work while awaiting test results'Workers are also getting abuse from residents over a local Covid-19 outbreak, BBC Wales is told.Wales politics","Rowan Foods has been linked to 289 cases Employees at a food factory in Wrexham linked to a coronavirus outbreak have been working on site while they wait for their test results, BBC Wales has been told. One worker at Rowan Foods said he worked a ten hour shift between being tested and finding out he had Covid-19. As of Saturday, the site has been linked to 289 cases. In a statement Rowan Foods said the virus is ""not spreading within our premises"". Meanwhile Public Health Wales has apologised for delays in getting test results to employees. Workers at Rowan Foods have previously told the BBC they did not feel safe at the factory and it was""impossible"" to keep to a social distance on site. An employee who tested positive for the virus told the BBC'sPolitics Wales programmethat the company had told workers to ""come into work until you've got your test results"". ""I think it's really unsafe because you don't know. They may have [Covid-19] and they may be spreading it without knowledge."" He added that the company ""have been putting production first over the wellbeing of staff"". Many workers were reluctant to take time off, he said, as they would only be legally entitled to Â£94 a week in statutory sick pay. One worker tested on 22 June was still waiting for a result on 3 July, it was claimed The partner of another employee who was tested on 22 June claimed he was still waiting for his result on 3 July and was continuing to work in the meantime. She said the delay was ""making us nervous"", especially as she has underlying illnesses. ""We don't know if he's got it or not... I don't know if he's going to bring it to the house."" She also claimed that workers were getting abuse from the local community. ""It's not the workers' fault. They have to fear going into work. It's disgusting,"" she said. The company, in response to previous claims it was impossible to keep a social distance at the site, has said measures were put in place in March to protect workers. Rowan Foods, following the latest claims, said its ""primary concern throughout the pandemic has been the health and welfare of our staff and their families"". It added that the virus ""is not spreading within our premises"" and ""no one who has symptoms is allowed on to site"". ""Had our site been responsible for the outbreak and putting our staff at risk, we would have closed,"" the company said. ""Instead we are doing the right thing by our employees"". The company added that ""from 1 June, no one will be financially disadvantaged by doing the responsible thing and isolating where required"". Public Health Wales apologised for the speed of test results Public Health Wales said the organisation was aware that some employees had experienced delays in getting their test results ""and we apologise for this"". ""Those individuals who have tested positive, even if they have not yet received their results, will have been contacted by contact tracers as part of the Test, Trace, Protect process. ""Colleagues at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board will be working over the next 48 hours to contact all individuals at Rowan Foods who have not yet received their results.""

"Quarantine rules relaxed for major sporting eventsNew rules mean F1, international football, golf and snooker tournaments can return in England.UK","New quarantine exemptions will allow major sporting events, as well as TV and film productions, to go ahead this summer, the government has said.

NHS boss calls for 'proper reform' to social care,"This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens: ""We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system"" Plans to adequately fund the social care sector need to be in place within a year, the head of NHS England has said. Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC the Covid-19 crisis had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. He said there was a need to ""decisively answer"" how high quality care could be provided long-term. The Department of Health said it would bring forward a plan for reform. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to find a cross-party solution to reduce pressures on the sector and provide long-term funding. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care What are the problems with the social care system? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Sir Simon said the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to give momentum to plans to overhaul how the system works. ""If any good is to come from this, we must use this as a moment to resolve once and for all to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,"" he said. ""The reality is that after at least two decades of talking about it, we do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social care system with a proper set of workforce supports."" He added: ""I would hope by the time we are sitting down this time next year on the 73rd birthday of the NHS that we have actually, as a country, been able to decisively answer the question of how are we going to fund and provide high-quality social care for my parents' generation. ""If you take back the history coming out of the Second World War, the country at that point was on austerity. We had rationing for bread and potatoes. ""The founders of the NHS did not use that as a moment to hesitate, they said, 'let one of the legacies of the war be the creation of the NHS'. ""That's the same legacy we need for long-term care support in social care coming out of coronavirus."" The coronavirus crisis has placed many care homes under additional stress Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he agreed with NHS England chief executive Sir Simon. ""The system needs a huge amount of work - it has been broken for a long time,"" Sir Keir said. ""I think it has been fractured, it's been underfunded, I think the staff have been undervalued and underpaid, and the prime minister needs to take responsibility. ""The Conservative government has been in power for 10 years and therefore they've had time to start doing something about social care - they haven't done it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it had set out a ""comprehensive action plan"" to support social care in England during the pandemic. ""We know there's a need for a long-term solution for social care and there are complex questions to address,"" they added. ""We will bring forward a plan that puts social care on a sustainable footing to ensure the reforms will last long into the future."" Cap on care costs considered before outbreak Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Adult social care encompasses the support provided by councils to older people and younger adults with disabilities. Unlike health care, social care is not generally provided for free. In England, anyone with assets over Â£23,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs, leading to the prospect of some having to sell their homes to pay for care. Services have also been stretched as a result of years of funding cuts from government and growing demand linked to an ageing population. In Scotland, free personal care is available. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. Political parties have been talking about reforming the sector for the past 20 years. The Conservatives previously brought forward legislation for a cap on care costs, but the plan was scrapped amid concerns about the costs of implementation. However, the idea was again considered by ministers in the current government prior to the coronavirus outbreak. At December's election, the government pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. It has subsequently given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Do you work in a care home?

Trump vows to defeat 'radical left' in 4 July speech,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left"" US President Donald Trump has used an Independence Day address to vow to defeat the ""radical left"" as protests sweep the country. Striking a combative tone, Mr Trump said he would ""fight... to preserve American way of life"", while railing at ""mobs"" targeting historical monuments. Ahead of his speech, Black Lives Matter protesters gathered nearby. Mr Trump's 2020 election rival Joe Biden said everyone deserved ""a full share of the American dream"". The 4 July holiday marks the nation's declaration of independence from Britain in 1776 and is one of the most important days in the national calendar. Historically presidents have used the occasion to deliver speeches extolling the virtues of unity. Last year Mr Trump spoke of the ""extraordinary heritage"" of the country at an event with a militaristic theme that involved Air Force flyovers and tanks parked on display. This year, Mr Trump's address was again followed by a flyover involving various aircraft, including B-52 bombers and F-35 fighter jets. President Trump and First Lady Melania watched military aircraft soar past the White House Speaking from the White House lawn on Saturday, Mr Trump took aim at protesters that he sees as anti-patriotic who have taken to the streets in the wake of the death in police custody in May of African-American George Floyd. ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and the people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing,"" he said. ""We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children."" Statues and monuments of historical figures associated with racism or slavery have been pulled down or removed amid the wave of protests - drawing Mr Trump's ire. ""Their goal is demolition,"" he declared. Elaborating onhis plan to create a ""National Garden of American Heroes""featuring statues of renowned Americans, Mr Trump said the country's rich heritage belonged to citizens of all races. ""The patriots who built our country were not villains,"" he said. ""They were heroes."" After he spoke, protesters in Baltimore, about 40 miles (65km) north of the capital, pulled down a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus - whom Mr Trump had mentioned in his speech - and rolled it into a harbour. Protesters tied ropes to the statue of Columbus before pulling it down Many people in the US celebrate the memory of Columbus, who in textbooks is credited with discovering ""the New World"", the Americas, in the 15th Century. But Native Americans have long objected to honouring Columbus, saying that his expeditions to the Americas led to the colonisation and genocide of their ancestors. Meanwhile, in a videotaped address for 4 July, Mr Trump's Democrat challenger for the presidency in November, Joe Biden, said Americans ""have a chance now to give the marginalised, the demonised, the isolated, the oppressed a full share of American dream"". Mr Biden, who has accused Mr Trump of fuelling racial tensions, said: ""We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country."" Flanked by his wife Melania, President Trump spoke to a crowd at the White House that included US soldiers and frontline medical staff. Despite a nationwide spike in coronavirus cases, Mr Trump touted the country's ""progress"" against the Covid-19 disease. President Trump invited medical staff and soldiers to the 4 July event at the White House Amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic, he said China - where the virus originated - must be ""held fully accountable"". US-China battle over coronavirus Where do statues go when they die? What makes a gathering a âsuperspreaderâ event? Praising America's ""scientific brilliance"", Mr Trump said the US ""will likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year"". The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned in June that scientists may never be able to create an effective vaccine against the coronavirus. ""The estimate is we may have a vaccine within one year,"" the WHO said. ""If accelerated, it could be even less than that, but by a couple of months. That's what scientists are saying."" The US has the world's highest number of coronavirus deaths and infections, and confirmed more than 43,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours on Saturday, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Florida, where the outbreak is especially acute, saw 11,458 new cases. The president made no reference to the nearly 130,000 US deaths linked to the pandemic. He said the US had tested almost 40 million people, adding that 99% of coronavirus cases were ""totally harmless"" - a claim for which he gave no evidence. Many 4 July events were cancelled on public health grounds, with beaches in Florida and California closed, city parades cancelled and firework displays curtailed. Joe Biden tweeted that ""this Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask"". Miami beaches have been closed for the holiday weekend, as have those in Los Angeles Firework displays are a traditional highlight of 4 July, but an estimated 80% of cities and towns have cancelled their shows. New York City usually holds an hour-long extravaganza, but this year it was replaced by five-minute displays through the week, organised by Macy's department store, with a final televised one on Saturday - all at undisclosed locations. Major League Baseball cancelled its 2020 All-Star Game for the first time since World War Two.

Factory staff 'working while awaiting test results',"Rowan Foods has been linked to 289 cases Employees at a food factory in Wrexham linked to a coronavirus outbreak have been working on site while they wait for their test results, BBC Wales has been told. One worker at Rowan Foods said he worked a ten hour shift between being tested and finding out he had Covid-19. As of Saturday, the site has been linked to 289 cases. In a statement Rowan Foods said the virus is ""not spreading within our premises"". Meanwhile Public Health Wales has apologised for delays in getting test results to employees. Workers at Rowan Foods have previously told the BBC they did not feel safe at the factory and it was""impossible"" to keep to a social distance on site. An employee who tested positive for the virus told the BBC'sPolitics Wales programmethat the company had told workers to ""come into work until you've got your test results"". ""I think it's really unsafe because you don't know. They may have [Covid-19] and they may be spreading it without knowledge."" He added that the company ""have been putting production first over the wellbeing of staff"". Many workers were reluctant to take time off, he said, as they would only be legally entitled to Â£94 a week in statutory sick pay. One worker tested on 22 June was still waiting for a result on 3 July, it was claimed The partner of another employee who was tested on 22 June claimed he was still waiting for his result on 3 July and was continuing to work in the meantime. She said the delay was ""making us nervous"", especially as she has underlying illnesses. ""We don't know if he's got it or not... I don't know if he's going to bring it to the house."" She also claimed that workers were getting abuse from the local community. ""It's not the workers' fault. They have to fear going into work. It's disgusting,"" she said. The company, in response to previous claims it was impossible to keep a social distance at the site, has said measures were put in place in March to protect workers. Rowan Foods, following the latest claims, said its ""primary concern throughout the pandemic has been the health and welfare of our staff and their families"". It added that the virus ""is not spreading within our premises"" and ""no one who has symptoms is allowed on to site"". ""Had our site been responsible for the outbreak and putting our staff at risk, we would have closed,"" the company said. ""Instead we are doing the right thing by our employees"". The company added that ""from 1 June, no one will be financially disadvantaged by doing the responsible thing and isolating where required"". Public Health Wales apologised for the speed of test results Public Health Wales said the organisation was aware that some employees had experienced delays in getting their test results ""and we apologise for this"". ""Those individuals who have tested positive, even if they have not yet received their results, will have been contacted by contact tracers as part of the Test, Trace, Protect process. ""Colleagues at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board will be working over the next 48 hours to contact all individuals at Rowan Foods who have not yet received their results.""

New Zealand Rocket Lab mission lost in flight,"The Electron mission was lost late in the ascent from Mahia Peninsula The American launch company that flies its rockets out of New Zealand has lost its latest mission. Rocket Lab said its Electron vehicle failed late in its ascent from Mahia Peninsula on North Island. All satellite payloads are assumed to have been destroyed. These included imaging spacecraft from Canon Electronics of Japan and Planet Labs Inc of California, as well as a technology demonstration platform from a UK start-up called In-Space Missions. Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck apologised to his customers. ""I am incredibly sorry that we failed to deliver our customers' satellites today. Rest assured we will find the issue, correct it and be back on the pad soon,"" he said on Twitter. UK takes Â£400m stake in satellite firm OneWeb Briton to take top weather satellite agency job UK industry loses out in European satellite bids Rocket Lab has made everyone in the space sector sit up since it debuted its Electron vehicle in 2017. It's at the head of a wave of new outfits that want to operate compact rockets to service the emerging market for small satellites. Saturday's lift-off from New Zealand was the Electron's 13th outing to date. All prior launches had been a complete success, bar the very first which failed to reach its intended orbit. Faraday-1 was roughly 10cm x 20cm x 30cm What went wrong this time is unclear. Video footage showed the rocket's second-stage engine operating normally five minutes and 40 seconds into the flight, at an altitude of 192km, and at a speed of 3.8km/s. The video feed then froze. The main payload on board was a satellite from Canon Electronics - part of a series the company is producing to image features on the ground smaller than a metre across. Planet, which operates the largest network of imaging spacecraft in orbit, was trying to loft five of its latest iteration of satellite. Because the San Francisco company produces and launches so many spacecraft, it will more easily bounce back from this failure. But for the In-Space Missions start-up, the Electron's loss is a major disappointment. Its Faraday-1 platform was to be the showcase of the company's new service. Faraday-1 was a kind of ""car pool"" satellite that allowed third parties to fly payloads in orbit without the requirement to fund and build a whole spacecraft themselves. They just needed to rent a compartment in Faraday-1, even if it was just for a standalone instrument or circuit board. Faraday-1 would have provided its on-board community of seven payloads with all the power, communications and operating support they required. Among those taking up this cost-effective solution was Prometheus, a new radio technology from the UK, Portsmouth arm of European aerospace giant Airbus. This equipment was to have conducted a radio-frequency survey, scanning the globe for distress beacons and the activities of military radars, with a view to incorporating this sensing capability into future services. Also present on board was Lacuna Space, who are based at the Harwell science campus in Oxfordshire. It's developing sensitive receivers to pick up faint signals from remote, battery-powered devices. These are being used in the burgeoning field of machine-to-machine communications - part of what's become known as the ""Internet of Things"". In-Space, which is itself based in Bordon, Hampshire, tweeted: ""The In-Space team is absolutely gutted by this news. Two years of hard work from an incredibly committed group of brilliant engineers up in smoke. It really was a very cool little spacecraft."" Future missions are already in production.

Quarantine rules relaxed for major sporting events,"New quarantine exemptions will allow major sporting events, as well as TV and film productions, to go ahead this summer, the government has said. Some sports teams and production crews will not have to quarantine upon arrival in England if they are essential to the event or production. The scheme gives the green light for Formula One, international football, golf and snooker tournaments to return. Ministers said darts, horse racing and other sports are expected to follow. 'Crystal clear' drunk people will not keep distance What can I do now? The government's new quarantine exemptions mean Silverstone will be able to stage races in August, while Champions League and Europa League football, the PGA British Masters Championship and the World Snooker Championships will go ahead. Announcing the scheme, which applies to England only, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""The British summer of sport is back on."" Under the new rules, sports authorities, event organisers and the film and TV industry would need to follow ""stringent protocols"" to become exempt from the 14-day quarantine rule. At the moment, most travellers to the UK must quarantine for two weeks. However, from 10 July, people arriving in England fromdozens of countries deemed ""low risk""will not have to isolate. BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SPORT:What now for the Olympics, F1 and Six Nations? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? Those who earn exemption by following the new rules will have to live and work in controlled ""bubbled"" environments and must be tested for coronavirus regularly. People working in the film industry will be required to remain for 14 days within a bubble that includes only their accommodation and production location. The scheme will apply to individuals coming into England specifically to work on film and television productions which qualify as British under one of the government's cultural tests or official co-production treaties. It comes as the culture secretary is under increasing pressure to provide further support to the performing arts. The government's plan for the return of live theatre and music, announced last week,was dismissed by many in the industry as inadequateamid calls for financial help and a timetable for reopening. Actors' union Equity said that without investment to save jobs and venues, such guidance would be ""meaningless"".

What makes a gathering a âsuperspreaderâ event?,"Some models suggest that just 20% of people - superspreaders - account for 80% of infections Now months into the US coronavirus outbreak, safety precautions have become routine: stand 6ft (2m) apart, wear a mask, and wash your hands. But still, certain 'superspreader' events - birthday parties, bar nights, and even choir practice - seem to be the culprits in an outsized number of Covid-19 infections. So how can one night out, or a single infected person, lead to dozens of cases? We asked Dr Abraar Karan, a physician and public health researcher at Harvard Medical School, to look at three different cases since the US outbreak began to understand how some events can shift from low to high risk, and how to avoid attending a superspreader event yourself. At a superspreading event, the number of cases transmitted will be disproportionately high compared to general transmission, Dr Karan says. And the risk of these superspreading events may balloon in the presence of superspreading people, who pass on their infection more widely either by being in contact with more people or emitting more of the virus. ""I tend to think of it as this: the vast majority of people may not infect any other people, and some people in certain situations infect a lot of people,"" he says. ""One person may infect 10 people, or 15 people or 20 people."" Can you go to a bar and stay safe? Dr Karan says that might be tricky Research is still being done, Dr Karan says, but early results indicate that coronavirus spread is primarily powered by these supercharged events. ""Different models have looked at this and they suggest that 20% of people account for 80% of spread."" And while risk profiles will vary widely between similar events, Dr Karan says there are certain factors that should raise a red flag. ""If you have any of the following in combination: indoors, crowded, closed spaces, without any sort of personal protective equipment like masks, which you're not going to have eating - I think those are all high-risk,"" he says. What happened? Back in March, early in the US outbreak, 61 members of a choir group in Skagit County, Washington, met for their weekly choir practice. One person at the two-and-a-half-hour meeting displayed cold-like symptoms. Days later, after an investigation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 53 Covid-19 cases were identified - 87% of the group that had assembled to sing. Two members of the group later died. What is the k number? Coronavirus superspreaders: Why are they important? Why Texas is seeing a coronavirus surge During the 10 March rehearsal, chairs were arranged in six rows of 20 chairs each, spaced 6-10 inches apart, according to a report by the CDC. Members took their usual rehearsal seats, with some space left over by the roughly 40 people not present that night. Some shared snacks during a 15-minute break, though no member reported physical contact between those present. Why the spread? In this case, the key factor is likely the group's reason for meeting: to sing. When you sing, similar to when you speak loudly or shout, you expel respiratory droplets from you mouth and nose, Dr Karan says. ""When you really are breathing out heavily from your airway you're producing more aerosol, smaller droplets that can hang around in the air,"" he says. In the Skagit County choir, the initial sick member could have expelled these droplets as they rehearsed, which then hovered in the air as members sang and socialised for more than two hours. What happened? On 30 May, the Barbosa family gathered in a group of 25 for a surprise birthday party. The north Texas family told US media that the host was unknowingly infected with Covid-19. By the end of June, family member Chance O'Shel said that eight family members and 10 friends of the family had contracted the virus, including grandparents Frank and Carole Barbosa, who were approaching their 68th anniversary. Amid the virus outbreak, drive-by birthdays like this one will be safer than an indoor gathering Both Frank and Carole Barbosa were later hospitalised, and on 1 July, Frank Barbosa died, family members said. ""They were even more cautious than they were before, but it still lead to my grandma, grandpa and aunt in the hospital,"" Mr O'Shel said of the gathering to local TV station KAVU. Why the spread? To Dr Karan, a birthday party similar to that of the Barbosa family's could have all the ingredients for a superspreading event. ""You can imagine if you're indoors at a birthday party, there's a lot of close contact there,"" he says. ""There's also people maybe lining up to use the restroom"", crowding together in small hallways where social distancing is impossible. As people drink and eat, more problems arise. First, it's unlikely you'll be using a facial covering as you eat - allowing for easier spread. Secondly, if party guests start drinking, rigid social distancing guidance may be more loosely followed, or outright ignored. ""We're asking people to change their behaviours, we're asking people to do things that are not natural to them"", to help curb the spread, Dr Karan says. ""If you introduce things like alcohol, it's more likely that people revert to their normal behaviour, they're less inhibited so they may forget."" And it matters who was initially infected, he explains. When the index case is someone central to the gathering, someone familiar with the guests -  like the host of a party, as was the case at the Barbosa birthday - that added intimacy and contact may contribute to extra infections. What happened? On 8 June, the owners of Harper's Restaurant and Brew Pub - a 10,000 square foot indoor restaurant with a large outdoor deck - opened its doors after weeks of Covid-19 closures. Managers provided training on safe practices, tables were pushed six feet apart and capacity was limited to around half of its typical crowd, allowing for approximately 225 customers. Alcohol and social distancing are probably not a good mix, Dr Karan tells the BBC But as of 2 July, a reported 152 infections in 13 counties across Michigan have been tied to Harper's. Of these cases, 128 reported they were present at the restaurant between 12 June and 20 June, and the remainder are close contacts of those who did. Why the spread? Heading to an indoor bar or restaurant may bring you into some risky territory, Dr Karan explains. Similar to a birthday party, food may be a factor. ""When you have people that are eating, they're not going to be wearing masks, they're going to be chewing and talking, and they're going to be face-to-face, across from one another,"" he says, allowing for droplets to transmit between guests. If loud music is playing, or a crowded venue makes it difficult to hear, loud speaking will also pile on some risk, ""like a party in overdrive"", Dr Karan says. The high temperatures that come with summer will add yet another complication, he says. ""There is some evidence that air conditioners may contribute to spread, potentially blowing droplets along the path of the air conditioner."" Add in the use of public restrooms, several high touch-point areas like doorknobs, and you have ready-made potential for superspread. ""I think taking precautions is important,"" Dr Karan says. ""But at the end of of the day, no matter how many precautions you take, some things are just high-risk, and I think bars are one of those things."" Why Texas is seeing a coronavirus surge.
