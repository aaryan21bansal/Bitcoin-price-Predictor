Chris Mason: New leader will shift political landscape,"He climbed high and fell fast. Boris Johnson will be remembered as a convention-smashing, rule-bending, first name recognition prime minister. A man whose character strengths, in the eyes of many Conservative MPs, were also his weaknesses. Great at campaigning, poor at governing, many backbenchers found themselves reflecting. Standing at the lectern in Downing Street, Boris Johnson was forced to articulate that his imagined future had been crushed. The boy who dreamed of being ""world king"" ejected. A primary colours prime minister provoking colourful reactions to the near end: protesters just beyond the Downing Street gates screaming ""liar"", some of his most loyal MPs comparing his defenestration to the downfall of Lady Thatcher. Boris Johnson is now, he insists, a prime minister emasculated, fulfilling a duty rather than a bucket list of ambitions. His supporters are pointing to convention that departing prime ministers loiter until their replacement rolls up, rather than instantly skedaddle to make way for a caretaker PM. As a spectator to this noise from Westminster, you might ponder: why them and what next? Why them, that tiny collection of MPs, deciding who should govern and lead, so relatively soon after a big election win? Well, in a parliamentary democracy, for better or worse - as opposed to those countries with a presidency - our party leaders, and so our prime ministers, are chosen by their parties, (and affiliated trade unions in the case of the Labour Party) not the rest of us. It means the thinnest sliver of the country will get to decide who replaces Boris Johnson. The electorate will have the chance to endorse or reject the chosen one, but only at the next election. Who could be the next prime minister? What happens next? In pictures: The rise and fall of a prime minister It may not surprise you to discover that Westminster is a postcode which doesn't suffer a deficit of ambition. The wannabes will fight a popularity contest among Tory MPs in the next few weeks, and two of them should be left at the end of that process, Conservative Party members will have the final say. Over the course of the summer, somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people will be charged with selecting the next head of our government on our behalf. It is a safe bet the next prime minister will be a very different character to Boris Johnson. Given the manner and motivations behind his toppling, being seen to ooze integrity and revere truth are qualities all the candidates will aspire to illustrate. But beyond that, there will be an intriguing debate about what it means to a Conservative in 2022. A Conservative in a high tax, high spending era. A Conservative in post-Brexit Britain, where neither main party at Westminster contests the fundamentals of the UK's departure from the EU, but where our relations with our nearest neighbours have not normalised since. When a new leader assumes office, the political landscape will instantly shift. Yes, they will have novelty and freshness, at least for a bit. But no electoral mandate to call their own. And the opposition parties will confront a new opponent. As the Boris Johnson era concludes, so too will there be new turf upon which the arguments of tomorrow will play out.

Baby P's mother released from prison,"Peter Connelly died after months of abuse The mother of Baby P has been released from prison. Tracey Connolly was jailed in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing the death of her son Peter at their home in Tottenham, north London, in 2007. Known initially only as Baby P, 17-month-old Peter Connolly suffered over 50 injuries, including a broken back. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, who had asked the Parole Boardto reconsider its decision to free her, for a second time described Connelly as ""pure evil"". In March, he referred to Connollyin the same wayafter the Parole Board decided she was suitable for release, having rejected bids in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The board heard she was considered to be at ""low risk of committing a further offence"" and that probation officers and prison officials supported the plan. She was first released on licence in 2013, but was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions. Tracey Connolly was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions Peter received 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over the final eight months of his life. A series of reviews found there had been opportunities for officials to save the toddler's life, if they had acted properly on the warning signs. His mother's boyfriend, Steven Barker and his brother, Jason Owen, were also jailed over Peter's death. The boss of Haringey Council's children's serviceswas awarded a Â£680,000 payoutfor unfair dismissal after arguingshe had been ""unfairly scapegoated"". Baby P's mother denied parole for third time Baby Peter: Trio who caused his death,external Timeline of Baby P case A Parole Board spokesman said in a statement: ""Following the reconsideration application from the secretary of state, a judge has ruled that the decision made by independent Parole Board members to release was not irrational, as stated in the reconsideration application, and the original decision is upheld."" Connelly will be subject to restrictions in terms of where she goes and who she contacts. She has more than 20 licence conditions. They include living at a specified address - initially a bail hostel - as well as being supervised by probation, wearing an electronic tag, adhering to a curfew and having to disclose her relationships.

Police apology after 'officers share suicide images',"This video can not be played The father said he remains ""physically sick"" about how his son's death was treated Two NI police officers have been investigated for more than three years over allegations they manipulated a person who died by suicide's body and shared photos and a video online. One of the officers has been suspended with full pay while the Police Ombudsman investigates. It is part of a wider investigation encompassing 11 separate but related incidents spanning several years. Several arrests have been made, the police ombudsman said. Warning: Graphic content If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story,help and support can be found at BBC Action Line. ""There are multiple suspects, including police officers and civilians, in Northern Ireland as well as in England,"" Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson added. The investigation is looking at a range of possible offences including misconduct, harassment and the suspected supply of drugs. Ms Anderson said the allegations around the two Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers were harrowing. At a Northern Ireland Policing Board meeting on Thursday, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne apologised to the family, adding that he ""just cannot imagine how harrowing this might be"". The victim's sister told BBC NI Spotlight that her brother's genitalia had been exposed in one of the photographs. ""No family should have had to endure the pain and suffering that has been caused by these images,"" Ms Anderson said. The family of the man who died by suicide from Belfast has spoken anonymously to BBC NI's Spotlight team about the alleged actions of the two officers, who were at the scene after their loved one's body was discovered in 2017. They said the allegations have worsened their trauma, while the family's lawyer compared the case to that of the two Met Police constables jailed fortaking and sharing photographs of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry. The man's father said he was ""physically sick to this day"" over the allegations. ""Those police officers were in the house while I was there - asked me to leave the room - and I done everything they asked me to at the time. ""And all that keeps coming back to me is why did I leave the room, because that must have been when they done it, when they took the photographs."" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told the policing board that suspension was a ""neutral act in employment"" and that the PSNI had to abide by the law. He added that they are ""sometimes caught on a rock and a hard place in trying to get that right"". The father was first informed of the allegations by Police Ombudsman investigators 18 months after his son died. ""They informed me that two police officers had been questioned regarding my son and photographs that might have been taken of my son,"" he told BBC Spotlight. He said the family was told ""it was a very serious affair and we weren't to discuss it"". The full details of what was alleged to have happened at the scene were drip-fed to the family over a number of meetings. The man's sister told Spotlight the two officers allegedly moved the body around the room in certain poses for pictures and for a video. The family also heard they added to pictures ""an exclamation bubble coming out of my brother's mouth making fun of the way that he was"". The sister added that, during one meeting, the ombudsman and a Scotland Yard officer told her that her brother's genitals had been exposed in one of the photographs. The same officer also allegedly photoshopped a speech bubble onto one of the photographs of the body and shared it on social media. She also said she believed the word ""taig"", a derogatory term for Catholics, was among the language used in the speech bubble. The sister added that she could not comprehend why anyone would be so cruel as to mock someone who had died by suicide. The chief constable said: ""There is no place not just for behaviour like this but for the added insult if you like of sectarian comments which would almost make your stomach churn if the issues in terms weren't bad enough."" In the five years since the suicide, no charges have been brought against the two police officers but a file has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). The family's lawyer PÃ¡draig Ã Muirigh said the five-year wait for justice was unacceptable. He pointed to the case of Metropolitan Police officers Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis who were jailed for two years after they photographed the bodies of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, and shared the images on WhatsApp. ""I appreciate some investigations are more complex than others but we're five years on,"" said Mr Ã Muirigh. ""We've had a similar case across the water in similar circumstances and that case has moved on."" The PSNI said it expected ""the highest standards of professionalism and integrity"" from its officers and staff He added: ""There will be huge public interest in this case and I think the family and the wider public has a right to know why someone has been suspended so long on full pay."" Northern Ireland's Police Ombudsman said it was ""vitally important that every aspect of this case is fully and thoroughly investigated"". Ms Anderson said the incident was part of a ""much broader and more complex case encompassing investigations into 11 separate and related incidents spanning several years"". ""Many of these matters became apparent between 2017 and 2020, either through new complaints or as a result of enquiries by my investigators. The most recent relevant complaint was received in 2020."" She added that: The potential offences under investigation include computer misuse, data protection breaches, misconduct in a public office, harassment, the suspected supply of illegal drugs, and the suspected theft, possession and supply of prescription drugs There are multiple suspects, including police officers and civilians, in Northern Ireland and England The investigation has included a number of arrests and searches, with more than 30 hours of interviews conducted and more than 60 electronic devices seized The ombudsman's investigation is now complete, with a file sent to the PPS ""After the criminal aspects have been concluded, I will consider recommendations to the chief constable in terms of disciplinary action,"" Ms Anderson said. ""All of those impacted by these incidents can be assured that we have given this case the priority and meticulous attention that it deserves, and we will continue to do so.""Â Â BBC Spotlight has contacted the solicitor representing the police officer suspended on full pay for comment. PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton confirmed an officer had been suspended while the investigation was ongoing. ""We expect the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all of our police officers and staff in accordance with the standards contained in the Police Service of Northern Ireland's code of ethics,"" he said. ""Breaches of the law and the code will be thoroughly investigated and robustly dealt with in accordance with the procedures laid out in our conduct regulations. ""I would encourage anyone who suspects a member of our service of abusing their position, in any manner, to report it to us, or to the ombudsman's office. ""You can be assured that the matter will be investigated thoroughly."" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton confirmed an officer had been suspended The man's sister said she had lost all confidence and trust in the PSNI because of the way the case has been handled. ""I couldn't even lift the phone and dial 999 now if I was in an emergency. I wouldn't want them near me or my family because they can't be trusted."" These latest revelations about alleged police misconduct followa BBC Spotlight investigation, Police, WhatsApp & Whistleblowers(currently on BBC iPlayer), which brought forward allegations made by two PSNI whistleblowers. They alleged serious misconduct and neglect by some officers in one of the largest police districts in Northern Ireland. Listen to Mandy's interview with the familyon BBC Sounds here.

"PM 'thinks' he reported oligarch meeting, MPs told","Alexander Lebedev in Moscow in 2019 Boris Johnson ""thinks"" he reported a meeting with Russian oligarch and ex-KGB officer Alexander Lebedev, a Foreign Office minister has said. Vicki Ford initially told MPs that in 2018 when he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson reported the meeting, where no officials were present, ""as required"". Minutes later, she corrected herself, saying the PM ""says that he thinks he mentioned this meeting to officials"". MPs are investigating Mr Johnson's award of a peerage to Mr Lebedev's son. Controversy has surrounded the peerage given to Evgeny Lebedev in 2020 since it was alleged - by Tortoise Media and the Sunday Times - that it was granted despite an assessment that it posed a national security risk. The Sunday Times said the security services' assessment of the peerage was withdrawn after a personal intervention by Mr Johnson, who is a long-time friend of Lord Lebedev. It is now the subject of an investigation by the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. Boris Johnson met Russian oligarch without aides PM was warned of Lebedev concerns, says Cummings Iâm not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer says Lord Lebedev, the owner of the London Evening Standard and a shareholder in the Independent, has denied he is posing a security risk to the UK. The prime minister confirmed the meeting with Alexander Lebedev, who bought the Evening Standard with his son in 2009 but later stepped down from the company, at the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday. He said: ""I certainly have met the gentleman in question, who used to be the proprietor of the London Evening Standard when I was mayor of London. ""On the occasion you are mentioning, if that was when I was foreign secretary, then yes."" On Thursday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper posed an urgent question in the Commons about the national security implications of the meeting in Italy, without security or officials present, at ""the height of the Salisbury poisoning crisis"" in April 2018. Ms Ford said the prime minister had said he met Alexander Lebedev ""on a very few occasions"" and added that she understood he had ""confirmed that he had met Mr Lebedev without officials present. And that he had subsequently reported those meetings to officials as required"". Boris Johnson is a long-time friend of Alexander Lebedev's son, Evgeny, pictured together here in 2009 Challenged by Labour's Chris Bryant that Mr Johnson had not said anything about notifying officials, Ms Ford said it was her understanding that he had reported the meeting. A few minutes later, she said: ""I have just been passed a note: apparently, the prime minister says that he thinks he mentioned this meeting to officials. I am reporting what I have been told."" The shadow home secretary said Alexander Lebedev was named and sanctioned by Canada as one of 14 people who directly enabled Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, but said the UK has not sanctioned him. Mr Putin and many of his closest aides were KGB officers, working for the Soviet Union's security services during the Cold War, like Mr Lebedev. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments Ms Cooper said: ""The charges against the prime minister are about not just a lack of integrity but a complete disregard for basic national security and the patriotic interests of the country."" She questioned whether the Foreign Office, Home Office and security services knew about the meeting in advance and whether a record of the meeting was made afterwards, as well as referring to rumours that Mr Johnson was too drunk to remember it in detail. The record of members' interests says Mr Johnson accepted hospitality for him and a guest, but travelled home alone, she said. ""Who was that guest? Did that put him in a compromising position?"" Labour foreign affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, Lord Collins of Highbury, called for Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to investigate, saying it was not enough for the prime minister to write to the liaison committee as he had promised on Wednesday.

Nadal withdraws from Wimbledon semi-final,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Rafael Nadal withdraws from the competition because of an abdominal injury Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from his Wimbledon semi-final against Nick Kyrgios with an abdominal injury. The 36-year-old Spanish second seed received treatment during his quarter-final against Taylor Fritz on Wednesday but pushed through the pain to win in five sets. ""I have tried a lot of times in my career to keep going but it is obvious the injury will get worse,"" he said. Kyrgios will play Novak Djokovic or Cameron Norrie in Sunday's final. Nadal confirmed he has a tear in his abdominal muscle which means he would not be able to be competitive over two matches. The 22-time Grand Slam champion had practised at Wimbledon away from the media earlier on Thursday but then called a news conference. ""Throughout the whole day I have been thinking about the decision to make,"" Nadal told reporters. ""I think it doesn't make sense to play. I feel very sad to say that."" Nadal had strapping on his abdomen during his fourth-round match but was in visible pain from the injury against Fritz. He took a medical timeout during the match and ignored calls from his father and sister to quit before somehow rallying to win. The two-time Wimbledon champion had been on course for a calendar Grand Slam, having won the Australian and French Opens already this year.  Nadal had been a doubt for Wimbledon because of a chronic foot condition which he had to manage during his run to a record-extending 14th French Open title last month. He had performed well at the All England Club but was visibly struggling during the match against Fritz. His serve was noticeably affected by the injury and he said on Thursday that he could not serve ""at a normal speed"". ""I can't imagine myself winning two matches and for respect to myself in some way I don't want to go out and not be competitive enough,"" Nadal said. ""A couple of weeks ago I saw my career very different because of the foot injury. ""The most important thing is happiness more than any titles. I can't risk that match and stay two or three months out of the competition. ""I am very sad and it is a very tough one."" Kyrgios wished Nadal well in a social media post, adding: ""We all hope to see you healthy soon."" Djokovic one of tougher tasks in tennis - Norrie Norrie should take risks against Djokovic - Henman How Norrie became a Wimbledon semi-finalist From unrecognised to centre stage - Norrie's rise This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Rafael Nadal come back to beat Taylor Fritz and reach the semi-finals Nadal has had a stunning year so far, despite playing much of it in pain from various injuries. He began the year by rallying from two sets down to beat Daniil Medvedev and lift the Australian Open title. He won his first 20 matches of the year before losing the Indian Wells final to Fritz, where he was hampered by a rib injury. Nadal then won the French Open with no feeling in his left foot as it was anesthetised because of chronic pain. He suffers from Mueller-Weiss syndrome - a rare degenerative condition that affects bones in the feet - and shortly after his Paris triumph he had a treatment that places heat on the nerves to numb pain. Nadal said it was the right decision to finish his match against Fritz, adding he was not a person to have regrets over decisions he makes. ""I had this feeling in the abdomen for the past week,"" he said. ""It will be three or four weeks, which is normal for these kind of injuries. ""I hope this will allow me to do my normal calendar, the calendar which I have in mind."" The US Open, which begins on 29 August, is the next Grand Slam tournament. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller It means the calendar Grand Slam is not to be for Nadal, but it was always unlikely. It appears on reflection he has decided there is no way he could be truly competitive in a semi-final against Nick Kyrgios. The US Open is seven weeks away. When you're 36 years of age, these injuries are likely to crop up more. Even though it is going to be a crushing disappointment to the Centre Court ticket holders, if he is not able to play to at least 90% of his ability, then he would probably feel there is very little point in taking to the court. Two-time Grand Slam winnerTracy Austinon BBC TV: ""You can tell how sad he is - he loves to compete, he's 36 years old and boy, has he had a tough year. After the foot injury at Roland Garros and the injections, it's hard to believe he won a major with a numb foot. ""He comes here and most of us thought he would retire yesterday in the second or third set. The guy just wants to compete, the will, the effort. But he said 'I need to have respect for myself, I don't want to go out there if I can't compete or serve well'."" Former British number oneJohn Lloydon BBC TV: ""When he said about not being able to play two matches he knows that even if by some miracle he had got through Nick Kyrgios there's no way he can get through two matches. ""If he can't play at 100% there's no way he's going to do it. You can see in his face how devastated he is - he's got to get well, move on and get healthy and that's the most important thing."" AnAll England Clubspokesperson: ""We wish to offer our sympathies to Rafa Nadal on his withdrawal. We appreciate how hard he has worked to be fit to compete, and wish him well in his recovery. ""We now look forward to an exciting semi-final tomorrow and finals weekend ahead, and to seeing Rafa back at Wimbledon next year."" Allow Instagram content?

"Man murdered after honeytrap set-up, court hears","Three men burst into Vishal Gohel's flat after he was promised a sexual liaison with three women, court hears A man was murdered in his own home after being set up by three women in a ""honeytrap"", a court heard. Vishal Gohel, 44, was found dead with gaffer tape on his face at his flat in High Street, Bushey, Hertfordshire, in January. The jury at St Albans Crown Court was told he had been promised a sexual liaison with the women before three men burst into the property. Three men and three women deny murder and manslaughter. They also deny conspiracy to rob on or before 23 January. The male defendants are: Tevin Leslie, 21, of Hurst Street, Brixton, London, Sakeen Gordon, 20, of Uxbridge Road, Ealing, Brandon Browne, 21, of Laburnham Road, Rochester, Kent. The female defendants are: Tiana Edwards Hancock, 18, of Fresh Wharf Road, Barking, Yarley Georgia Bruce-Annan, 20, of Harts Lane, Barking, and Faith Hoppie, 21, of Blake Avenue, Barking. Mr Gohel was found dead at his flat by his neighbour, the court heard Prosecutor Charlotte Newell QC said: ""The female defendants created a honeytrap. ""They promised him a sexual liaison that never happened. ""It allowed them to give entry to the three male defendants so they could burst in and take Vishal Gohel unawares and steal property from him."" The prosecutor said a post-mortem examination showed Mr Gohel suffered severe blows to his head with internal bruising to his scalp, eyes and jaw and brain damage. She said efforts had been made to clean up the flat and an iPhone and an iWatch had been taken. The trial continues.

Jail for woman who claimed murder was an accident,"A woman who fatally wounded a man but claimed she did not mean to kill him has been jailed for at least 16 years. Stephanie Bowie stabbed 21-year-old Darren Russell twice in the chest outside a restaurant in Erskine, Renfrewshire, on New Year's Day 2021. She denied murder, saying she ""accidentally"" wounded the victim when she brought out the knife to scare him. Jurors found her guilty of murder after atrial at the High Court in Glasgow.. Jailing her for life at the High Court in Stirling, the judge said she would serve a minimum of 16 years before she was eligible to apply for parole. Lord Weir said she had she had committed a ""deplorable act of lethal violence"". The trial, last month, heard that Bowie, 29, had stormed to the scene after her brother Mark had been in a minor row with Mr Russell. The two men - and others - had earlier been in the grounds of nearby Barsail Primary School where they got into an argument. Bowie took a taxi from Paisley to Erskine after learning of the row, having grabbed a knife before getting into the cab. She turned up at the school and immediately threatened to kill Mr Russell. The victim's best friend Craig Smith said they all eventually ended up on a path near the Grill in the Park Bar and Restaurant in Erskine. Mr Smith, 23, said: ""I did not know why she was going for my friend. ""I was trying to get Mark to calm down his sister. Me and Mark had a kind of discussion...as I turned, he (Mr Russell) just fell to the deck and she has come skipping past, all happy."" As the Bowies ran off, Mr Smith helped his friend back to the home he shared with his parents nearby, but he later died. Stephanie Bowie admitted she had killed Mr Russell but claimed she had not meant it, despite the blows being deep into the victim's body. She claimed while Mr Russell was standing over her, she ""panicked"" and brought out the knife hidden up her sleeve. Bowie said she got rid of the knife and her blood-stained jacket. She also altered her hairstyle to try to avoid being caught. A jury found her guilty of murder, possession of a bladed article and an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. After the verdict, the court was told Bowie had a number of previous convictions including for threatening behaviour and breaching bail. The senior investigating officer in the case,  Ch Insp Christopher Nisbet,  said Bowie was now facing the consequences of her actions. ""I hope this sentence sends a clear message that violence and the carrying of weapons is completely unacceptable,"" he said. He added: ""We hope that this conviction brings at least a degree of closure for his relatives and friends. ""We know it has a devastating and significant impact on individuals, families and communities. ""We will continue to work closely with partners and remain determined to bring perpetrators to justice.""

In pictures: The rise and fall of a prime minister,"Boris Johnson has resigned as leader of the Conservative Party, less than three years after leading them to election victory. He will stay on as prime minister in a caretaker capacity until his replacement is elected. Here we chart his rise and fall in pictures. Boris Johnson was born on 19 June 1964, in New York, and his family moved many times during his childhood. He went to Eton College. He went on to University of Oxford, where was president of the Oxford Union. It's also where he met his first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen. They divorced in 1993. His first career was as a journalist. He worked for the Daily Telegraph, and eventually became editor of the Spectator magazine. A flamboyant character, he appeared on the BBC's Have I Got News for You programme, and was pictured being taught to dance by television presenter Ulrika Jonsson. He had always nursed political ambitions, and in 2001 he was elected as the Conservative MP for Henley. His style was often unconventional. In 2003, he took to the River Thames in a coracle, in aid of Save The Children. Known for throwing himself into whatever was before him, he was pictured rugby-tackling German midfielder Maurizio Gaudino during a charity football match at the Madejski Stadium in Reading. By 2008, he was the Conservative candidate for mayor of London. He won by a comfortable margin and is pictured here being congratulated by then Conservative Party leader David Cameron on the night of his election victory. By then he was married to Marina Wheeler, a barrister. They had four children and divorced in 2020. London's successful bid to host the Olympics in 2012 provided more photo opportunities. As did a trade visit to Japan, where he knocked over a 10-year-old while playing touch rugby. A keen cyclist, his time as mayor also saw the introduction of a public bicycle hire scheme and cycle superhighways in London. Mr Johnson returned to national politics - winning a seat in Parliament in the 2015 general election under the leadership of Prime Minister David Cameron - but also continued as mayor of London until 2016. He was thrust into the limelight in the 2016 EU referendum, when he and Michael Gove campaigned for the UK to leave the European Union. The Vote Leave campaign won the referendum. Mr Cameron stood down as prime minister the next day, but Mr Johnson confounded expectations when he announced he would not stand to succeed him. Theresa May became prime minister and appointed Mr Johnson to the post of foreign secretary. As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson travelled widely, and is seen here on a trip to Myanmar in 2017. The following year he resigned from the cabinet in protest at Mrs May's Brexit deal. After months of political deadlock over how the UK would leave the EU, Mrs May was forced to stand down. Mr Johnson threw his hat in the ring to replace her as prime minister. He beat Jeremy Hunt by 92,153 votes to 46,656 to be elected the new Conservative leader, and was asked to form a government by the Queen. After Mr Johnson found himself unable to make progress on Brexit, he called another general election. During the campaign, he said the UK would fully exit the EU by December 2020. His gamble paid off as he was returned to power with a much-increased majority. Mr Johnson was back in 10 Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds. By January 2020, the UK had left the EU but it, like the rest of the world, faced a growing challenge as coronavirus started to spread following an initial outbreak in China. The virus led to extreme measures, with people told to stay at home and practise social distancing. Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak joined in national applause to show appreciation for NHS workers. Mr Johnson himself caught the virus and had to self-isolate, though still led the country from his home. But after 10 days, his symptoms had deteriorated and he was taken to hospital, spending some time in intensive care. Three weeks later he was back at work, praising the ""sheer grit and guts"" of the British public. Weeks later, Mr Johnson and his fiancÃ©e Ms Symonds announced the birth of a son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. The name Nicholas was a tribute to the two doctors who treated Mr Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. At the end of October, Mr Johnson announced a second lockdown would begin in England to prevent a ""medical and moral disaster"" for the NHS. He said he hoped taking immediate action would mean families could get together for Christmas. There was some good news in December, as the biggest vaccination programme in the country's history began. On a visit to a London hospital to see some of the first people getting the jab, Mr Johnson said getting vaccinated was ""good for you and good for the whole country"". In a secretly planned wedding at Westminster Cathedral, Mr Johnson married Ms Symonds in May 2021. The death of the MP Sir David Amess, 69, who was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, shocked the country. Mr Johnson told how several members of his cabinet broke down in tears when they learned of the death. In December 2021, Mrs Johnson gave birth to their second child, a girl called Romy. Here the couple and the baby are seen on a video call at Chequers. In January 2022, Mr Johnson and his government faced mounting pressure over several events that are alleged to have been held during lockdowns. In June, he faced a confidence vote in his leadership - winning by 211 votes to 148, in a secret ballot of Conservative MPs. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mr Johnson offered military equipment to help the country defend its territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the prime minister after he announced his resignation, during which Kyiv officials says the Ukrainian leader expressed his ""sadness"" upon hearing the news. Having been dogged by controversy, including the fine for breaking his own lockdown laws and his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, Mr Johnson announced his resignation on 7 July, following a flood of government resignations.

PM reshuffles cabinet until new leader takes over,"Conservative MP James Cleverly is among those given cabinet roles Boris Johnson has filled vacant posts in his cabinet, after a wave of resignations left roles empty and shattered the PM's authority. Mr Johnson has quit as Tory leader and these ministers will remain in place until a successor is elected. Greg Clark has been named new levelling up secretary, and James Cleverly as education secretary. And Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, as Wales secretary, in the swift reshuffle. Mr Buckland said the new cabinet would ensure the ""day-to-day operation"" of the government, with Mr Johnson staying on as ""caretaker"" PM. Mr Johnson has pledgednot to make major policy decisionsbefore his successor is chosen, with a contest expected to conclude by September. Follow updates live as Boris Johnson resigns as Tory leader Shailesh Vara becomes Northern Ireland secretary, Kit Malthouse has been appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Andrew Stephenson as minister without portfolio. Mr Johnson has also moved to fill the raft of more junior positions left by the avalanche of resignations that triggered his departure. Among these Will Quince, whoresigned as an education ministerover being given ""inaccurate briefings"" about the Chris Pincher affair, returns to his old position. And Johnny Mercer, who resigned as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans in Northern Ireland, has returned to government as a Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for veterans. Edward Timpson becomes the new solicitor general, with Paul Scully and Marcus Jones becoming ministers at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. However, the BBC understands, government whips are having discussions about how to get current legislation through Parliament with so few junior ministers. In his resignation speech, Mr Johnson said he had appointed a new a cabinet to serve until a successor is elected to replace him as Tory leader and prime minister. But opposition parties and some Tory MPs have urged Mr Johnson to go now to avoid government paralysis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson must not be allowed to ""cling on"" in No 10 once he has resigned, and he threatened to use a confidence motion in Parliament to oust him. Former prime minister Sir John Major said it was ""unwise and may be unsustainable"" for Mr Johnson to remain in office until a new Conservative Party leader is elected. Sir John suggested Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab could serve as acting prime minister until a new leader is elected. Or, he said, Tory MPs could elect the new leader who would become prime minister, with party members then asked to endorse the decision. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments The newly appointed levelling up secretary said he would do his best to ""provide stability"". Mr Clark, who replaceda sacked Michael Gove, tweeted: ""We have a duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government in the weeks ahead."" Other cabinet ministers will remain in post, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The appointments follow a dramatic 48 hours in which dozens of ministers - including former chancellor Rishi Sunak - resigned and plunged Mr Johnson's leadership into crisis. Mr Sunak's replacement as chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was later among the ministers urging the PM to quit. Mr Johnson resisted the calls until Thursday morning, when it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his MPs and that the government could no longer function. Less than three years ago, Mr Johnson won an historic landslide victory in a general election - but he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws. The revolt this week was triggered by revelations about the prime minister's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher. Now Mr Johnson has stood down, a party leadership contest has been triggered and the eventual winner will become the next prime minister. Sir Graham - the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs - is expected to set out the timetable to nominate Mr Johnson's replacement next week. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country will vote for the winner. Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a former joint secretary of the 1922 Committee, told the BBC the process to whittle down the list of candidates to two could be done before MPs break for summer recess on 21 July. Attorney General Suella Braverman and former Brexit minister Steve Baker have both indicated they will run for the leadership, with more senior Tories expected to throw their hats into the ring in the coming days. Ms Truss and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who are both popular with Tory members - have been tipped as potential frontrunners.

"UK debt on unsustainable path, watchdog says","UK debt is on an ""unsustainable path"" unless spending is tightened and taxes are raised, the government's independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said soaring energy prices and pressures from an ageing population risked tipping the UK into a recession. Moving away from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones could also hit tax revenues, the OBR said. It forecast debt levels could more than treble in 50 years' time. High inflation is driving up interest payments. In May they hit Â£7.6bn, the highest level for that month on record and a Â£3.1bn jump from a year earlier. Inflation pushes UK interest costs to May record What is GDP and how does it affect me? People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise In its fiscal risks and sustainability report, the OBR said the government had already spent as much this year, 1.25% of GDP, to help households cope with the cost-of-living crisis as it did supporting the economy through the 2008 financial crisis. The OBR said bringing debt back to 75% of GDP, the level at which it stabilised in the government's pre-pandemic March 2020 Budget, ""would need taxes to rise, spending to fall, or a combination of both"". ""The pressures of an ageing population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term,"" the OBR said. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars from 2030. Fuel duties are currently a big source of tax revenue. The Office for Budget Responsibility has for the first time combined its assessment of the sustainability of the government's finances with risks from wars, trade tensions, cyber attacks and the net zero transition. The overall picture is a sobering one for whoever takes over in Downing Street - a clear indication that tax rises will be required. Growth is assumed to be smaller, as the economy is less productive. Long-standing demographic challenges that will raise spending and old age dependency, have become worse, says the OBR, leading to government spending being concentrated on the NHS, social care and pensions payments and other areas of spending being squeezed. At the same time some sources of tax revenue, such as fuel duty, are on course to disappear entirely. The OBR also model the risk of today's energy shock persisting, a major cyber attack, and the need for a significant rise in defence spending to deal with new tensions around the world. The result would be ballooning government debts. While the portals of political power are focused very much on the short term, the OBR report is a warning of very many future risks, currently gaining little attention. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. In May 2022, it was Â£2.36 trillion. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 95.8% ofgross domestic product (GDP). The OBR said the Ukraine war, soaring energy prices and long-term pressure on the nation's finances ""add up to a challenging outlook for this and future governments as they steer the public finances through inevitable future shocks"". ""Many threats remain, with rising inflation potentially tipping the economy into recession, continued uncertainty about our future trading relationship with the EU, a resurgence in Covid cases, a changing global climate, and rising interest rates all continuing to hang over the fiscal outlook,"" it said. Households are currently being hit by higher fuel, food and energy costs. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 9.1%. It has led to many people cutting back on spending, especially on food and car journeys,according to a BBC-commissioned survey. It has also fuelled fears that the UK could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods -after the economy shrank in March and April. But the OBR said the current energy price woes may not be as bad as that seen in the 1970s. ""While the oil crises of the 1970s saw global energy prices rise by a similar magnitude as we have seen in the wake of the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are reasons to believe that the overall impact on inflation, output, and unemployment will be less severe and less persistent this time around,"" it added.

Tunisian third seed Jabeur became the first Arab player to reach a Grand Slam singles final with a 6-2 3-6 6-1 win over Tatjana Maria. Rybakina then became the first singles player from Kazakhstan to reach a major final with a 6-3 6-3 dismantling of former champion Simona Halep. The two will meet on Saturday. Jabeur has become a favourite at Wimbledon, and she and good friend Maria thrilled the crowd, before sharing a long and loving embrace at the net as Jabeur secured victory. Maria gave birth to her second child Cecilia only last year, and has defied the odds in a remarkable run to the Wimbledon semi-finals. Ranked second in the world, Jabeur is the first African woman to reach a major final since South Africa's Sandra Reynolds at Wimbledon in 1960.

""I think it's going to be a great match [against Ons Jabeur]; she's a great player, very tricky player - it's not going to be easy to play against her drop shots and volleys,"" Rybakina said. ""I think it will be a great match - I think I already did the work so it's time to enjoy it out on court."" Born in Russia, she has represented Kazakhstan since 2018 after they offered her more financial support and will now bid to become the country's first player to win a major singles trophy. Russian players werebanned by Wimbledon from competing this yearafter the country's invasion of Ukraine. Asked about her Russian background, the Moscow-born player said: ""I've been playing for Kazakhstan for a long time. I'm really happy representing Kazakhstan. They believed in me.

Known as the 'Minister of Happiness' in her country, Jabeur is a popular figure in Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa as she continues to be a trailblazer. ""I'm a proud Tunisian woman here today and I know in Tunisia they are going crazy right now,"" she said. ""I try to inspire as much as I can and I want to see more Arab and African players on the tour."" On the basis of their rankings, Jabeur was the overwhelming favourite against Maria - and that eventually was borne out in a compelling contest. Both players have a similar style, keen to use their slice and play with variety, and it made for an entertaining match. After an edgy start by both players, Jabeur's extra quality shone through in the first set. Immediately Maria's serve came under pressure in an eight-minute opening game, the German eventually holding after seeing off two break points. However, she was unable to withstand more pressure in her next service game and Jabeur moved into a lead she would not relinquish in the opening set. The third seed appeared to be cruising towards a routine win when she earned two more break points in the second game of the second set. But Maria saved those and it sparked a switch of momentum. Perhaps it should not have been surprising, considering Maria had fought back from a set down in three of her previous five matches - including her quarter-final win over fellow German Jule Niemeier. Maria decisively broke in the fourth game and, after failing to break again for the set in the eighth, served it out to the delight of the 15,000 fans who were desperate for the action to be prolonged. Ominously for Maria, Jabeur's level returned at the start of the decider. Jabeur broke for a 2-0 lead with a forehand passing winner, and from there she coasted to a victory which she said would leave her fellow Tunisians ""celebrating like crazy"" back home. ""On the court we knew both that we will go out and do our best, and after we knew that we still were going to be friends,"" Maria said. ""She's an amazing person. I'm really happy for her and I hope she can win it.""

As the only player left with any Grand Slam final experience, Halep was the heavy favourite at a venue where she has won 12 straight matches. However, she was overpowered from the off by Rybakina, who used her big serve and equally giant groundstrokes to wrongfoot Halep. The Romanian faced at least one break point in each of her first five service games, let down by a first-serve rate of 53% and nine double faults. Rybakina showed no sign of nerves, bringing up three set points in the first with an 118mph ace, before converting on a long Halep forehand. Her momentum continued in the second set, with Halep saving a break point in her first service game before coughing up back-to-back double faults to leave her in serious trouble. Halep managed to get the break back and did it to love, stringing together three points for the first time in the match, but another double fault in the next game handed the lead back to Rybakina. From then, Halep's shoulders dropped, and Rybakina needed no further encouragement, again racing through her service games to put Halep under pressure. The frustration was evident when Halep, serving to stay in the match at 5-3, went from 40-15 up to deuce on yet another double fault. She stood for a long time, leaning on her racquet, hand on her thigh as the crowd attempted to urge her on. However, a wonderful return of serve from Rybakina caught the line to stun both Halep and the crowd. ""She deserved to win today with the way I played,"" Halep said. ""Somehow I think I gave her the perfect ball to do her game.""

"Baby P's mother released from prisonDominic Raab previously condemned the decision, saying the Parole Board needs an ""overhaul"".London","Peter Connelly died after months of abuse The mother of Baby P has been released from prison. Tracey Connolly was jailed in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing the death of her son Peter at their home in Tottenham, north London, in 2007. Known initially only as Baby P, 17-month-old Peter Connolly suffered over 50 injuries, including a broken back. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, who had asked the Parole Boardto reconsider its decision to free her, for a second time described Connelly as ""pure evil"". In March, he referred to Connollyin the same wayafter the Parole Board decided she was suitable for release, having rejected bids in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The board heard she was considered to be at ""low risk of committing a further offence"" and that probation officers and prison officials supported the plan. She was first released on licence in 2013, but was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions. Tracey Connolly was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions Peter received 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over the final eight months of his life.

They include living at a specified address - initially a bail hostel - as well as being supervised by probation, wearing an electronic tag, adhering to a curfew and having to disclose her relationships.

HSBC banker quits after 'nut job' climate speech,"A senior HSBC executive who accused central bankers and officials of exaggerating the financial risks of climate change has resigned. Stuart Kirk, the bank's global head of responsible investing, was reportedly suspended in May after he said in a speech: ""There's always some nut job telling me about the end of the world."" He said on Thursday his comments had made his position ""unsustainable"". ""A cancel culture destroys wealth and progress,"" he addedin a LinkedIn post.,external Mr Kirk's role, which is based in London, involved considering the impact of investments on environmental, social and governance issues. Big banks fund new oil despite net zero pledges HSBC suspends banker over 'nut job' climate speech In his resignation statement, he said he had ""only ever tried to do the best for my clients and readers"" in a ""27-year unblemished record in finance, journalism and consulting"". ""Ironically given my job title, I have concluded that the bank's behaviour towards me since my speech at a Financial Times conference in May has made my position, well, unsustainable,"" he said. ""Funny old world."" HSBC came under pressure to investigate Mr Kirk after he gave the presentation entitled ""Why investors need not worry about climate risk"" at a conference. In the address he made light of the risks of major floods and said that he had to spend his time ""looking at something that's going to happen in 20 or 30 years"". During the 15-minute address, Mr Kirk said climate change was ""not a financial risk that we need to worry about"". ""Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are always wrong,"" a slide showed as part of the presentation said. Later in the presentation, he said: ""Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that's a really nice place."" Mr Kirk said on Thursday that investing was ""hard"" and ""so is saving our planet"". ""Opinions on both differ. But humanity's best chance of success is open and honest debate. If companies believe in diversity and speaking up, they need to walk the talk. A cancel culture destroys wealth and progress,"" he added. ""There is no place for virtue signalling in finance."" Mr Kirk also announced he had been gathering a ""crack group of like-minded individuals"" to deliver ""what is arguably the greatest sustainable investment idea ever conceived"". ""I will continue to prod with a sharp stick the nonsense, hypocrisy, sloppy logic and group-think inside the mainstream bubble of sustainable finance,"" he said. HSBC declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Following Mr Kirk's speech, the bank's group chief executive Noel Quinn said he did not agree ""at all"" with his remarks, adding ""they are inconsistent with HSBC's strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management"".

PM reshuffles cabinet until new leader takes overGreg Clark and James Cleverly among those given roles as Boris Johnson replaces ministers who quit.UK PoliticsComments,"Conservative MP James Cleverly is among those given cabinet roles Boris Johnson has filled vacant posts in his cabinet, after a wave of resignations left roles empty and shattered the PM's authority. Mr Johnson has quit as Tory leader and these ministers will remain in place until a successor is elected. Greg Clark has been named new levelling up secretary, and James Cleverly as education secretary. And Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, as Wales secretary, in the swift reshuffle. Mr Buckland said the new cabinet would ensure the ""day-to-day operation"" of the government, with Mr Johnson staying on as ""caretaker"" PM. Mr Johnson has pledgednot to make major policy decisionsbefore his successor is chosen, with a contest expected to conclude by September. Follow updates live as Boris Johnson resigns as Tory leader Shailesh Vara becomes Northern Ireland secretary, Kit Malthouse has been appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Andrew Stephenson as minister without portfolio. Mr Johnson has also moved to fill the raft of more junior positions left by the avalanche of resignations that triggered his departure. Among these Will Quince, whoresigned as an education ministerover being given ""inaccurate briefings"" about the Chris Pincher affair, returns to his old position. And Johnny Mercer, who resigned as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans in Northern Ireland, has returned to government as a Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for veterans. Edward Timpson becomes the new solicitor general, with Paul Scully and Marcus Jones becoming ministers at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. However, the BBC understands, government whips are having discussions about how to get current legislation through Parliament with so few junior ministers. In his resignation speech, Mr Johnson said he had appointed a new a cabinet to serve until a successor is elected to replace him as Tory leader and prime minister. But opposition parties and some Tory MPs have urged Mr Johnson to go now to avoid government paralysis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson must not be allowed to ""cling on"" in No 10 once he has resigned, and he threatened to use a confidence motion in Parliament to oust him. Former prime minister Sir John Major said it was ""unwise and may be unsustainable"" for Mr Johnson to remain in office until a new Conservative Party leader is elected. Sir John suggested Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab could serve as acting prime minister until a new leader is elected. Or, he said, Tory MPs could elect the new leader who would become prime minister, with party members then asked to endorse the decision. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments The newly appointed levelling up secretary said he would do his best to ""provide stability"". Mr Clark, who replaceda sacked Michael Gove, tweeted: ""We have a duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government in the weeks ahead."" Other cabinet ministers will remain in post, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The appointments follow a dramatic 48 hours in which dozens of ministers - including former chancellor Rishi Sunak - resigned and plunged Mr Johnson's leadership into crisis. Mr Sunak's replacement as chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was later among the ministers urging the PM to quit. Mr Johnson resisted the calls until Thursday morning, when it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his MPs and that the government could no longer function. Less than three years ago, Mr Johnson won an historic landslide victory in a general election - but he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws. The revolt this week was triggered by revelations about the prime minister's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher. Now Mr Johnson has stood down, a party leadership contest has been triggered and the eventual winner will become the next prime minister. Sir Graham - the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs - is expected to set out the timetable to nominate Mr Johnson's replacement next week. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country will vote for the winner. Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a former joint secretary of the 1922 Committee, told the BBC the process to whittle down the list of candidates to two could be done before MPs break for summer recess on 21 July. Attorney General Suella Braverman and former Brexit minister Steve Baker have both indicated they will run for the leadership, with more senior Tories expected to throw their hats into the ring in the coming days. Ms Truss and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who are both popular with Tory members - have been tipped as potential frontrunners.

Bridge disaster trial prompts hopes for new Italy,"Egle Possetti lost several members of her family and hopes for justice from the Genoa trial Four years after Genoa's Ponte Morandi motorway bridge collapsed killing 43 people, a long-awaited trial has begun involving key figures responsible for looking after the structure. Fifty-nine people face a variety of charges including manslaughter and safety failures. Families of those who died say they are not just hoping for justice. ""A different Italy can come out of this trial,"" said Egle Possetti, head of the committee for victims of the disaster. ""It's the tip of an iceberg because it's not just the Morandi bridge that had problems but the country's entire infrastructure that has to be controlled in a proper manner,"" she told Ansa news agency. The bridge, on the A10 motorway through Genoa, linked northern Italy to France. A 200m (656ft) section came down during a storm on 14 August 2018 sending dozens of vehicles plunging 45m to the dry riverbed below. The disaster has been blamed on cables, encased in concrete in a bridge pillar, which became corroded by sea air. Many of the 59 on trial worked for Italian motorway firm Autostrade per Italia (Aspi) and Spea engineering company, which was responsible for looking after the bridge. Most of them are accused of knowing the bridge could collapse but failing to act and all the defendants deny the charges against them. The charges range from multiple manslaughter to wilfully removing safety features in the workplace and harming transport safety. The collapse of a bridge and the desperate search for bodies are still vivid memories for those who witnessed the deadly disaster in torrential rain four years ago. I was in Genoa visiting my parents, driving to the city centre, when the traffic suddenly became paralysed and a large cloud of smoke rose into the air. I soon realised something was wrong when I saw scooters rushing back on the wrong side of the road. I got out of my car and when the smoke cleared I saw that the majestic bridge that once linked the French and Italian Rivieras and that I had passed under thousands of times was no longer there. It had crumbled within seconds. Dozens of vehicles were crossing the Morandi bridge when it collapsed A girl whose car was hit by chunks of concrete told me it had come down like sand. Cars fell from the bridge while a truck underneath it was destroyed - its driver escaping with his face covered in blood. A shiny new bridge was built in record time. But Genoa and its people are still angry and grieving and watching this trial very closely. Outside the court on Thursday, survivor Gianluca Ardini said he felt compelled to come to the trial to be close to the victims' families. He was left stranded for hours in his van 20m above the ground before he was rescued with severe injuries. His colleague was killed. ""What happened is a disgrace - the leaders of Aspi knew how badly that damned bridge had been looked after, but they didn't intervene so they could make more money."" Former Aspi chief executive Giovanni Castellucci is among the best known of those on trial. His lawyer said it was important to establish the truth behind the bridge collapse, and the trial would find out that a construction defect was responsible for the disaster. Although a number of executives and staff from Aspi and Spea are defendants, the companies themselves have already agreed an out-of-court settlement with prosecutors. The motorway company itself has been renationalised since the bridge collapsed. Its current chief executive, Roberto Tomasi, is on a prosecution list of 178 witnesses. Ms Possetti, who lost her sister, brother-in-law and two nephews in the collapse, told reporters outside the court that it was a difficult day but a very important one. ""Today we are beginning a long and tiring journey that will bring truth and justice to our families."" A marquee was set up outside the court for anyone who wants to watch the trial unfold. After Thursday's initial hearing, chaired by three judges, the case was adjourned until September and will continue until July next year. The old Morandi bridge has since been replaced by a new structure designed by Genoa-born architect Renzo Piano.

History-making Jabeur reaches Wimbledon final,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Best shots of Jabeur as she reaches Wimbledon final in style Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. History makers Ons Jabeur and Elena Rybakina will meet in the Wimbledon final after the pair claimed impressive victories in the last four. Tunisian third seed Jabeur became the first Arab player to reach a Grand Slam singles final with a 6-2 3-6 6-1 win over Tatjana Maria. Rybakina then became the first singles player from Kazakhstan to reach a major final with a 6-3 6-3 dismantling of former champion Simona Halep. The two will meet on Saturday. Jabeur has become a favourite at Wimbledon, and she and good friend Maria thrilled the crowd, before sharing a long and loving embrace at the net as Jabeur secured victory. Maria gave birth to her second child Cecilia only last year, and has defied the odds in a remarkable run to the Wimbledon semi-finals. Ranked second in the world, Jabeur is the first African woman to reach a major final since South Africa's Sandra Reynolds at Wimbledon in 1960. ""It is a dream come true after years and years of work and sacrifice,"" said Jabeur. ""I'm really happy it is paying off and now there is one more match to come."" Live text, TV and radio coverage of the Wimbledon women's singles semi-finals 'I could see myself as a tennis mum like Tatjana' - Ons Jabeur column She and world number 23 Rybakina, who is the fourth-lowest ranked player to reach the Wimbledon final since 1984, will meet on Centre Court in a match-up of two first-time Grand Slam finalists. While Rybakina's progression has gone under the radar, she outmuscled former world number one Halep with relative ease. ""I think it's going to be a great match [against Ons Jabeur]; she's a great player, very tricky player - it's not going to be easy to play against her drop shots and volleys,"" Rybakina said. ""I think it will be a great match - I think I already did the work so it's time to enjoy it out on court."" Born in Russia, she has represented Kazakhstan since 2018 after they offered her more financial support and will now bid to become the country's first player to win a major singles trophy. Russian players werebanned by Wimbledon from competing this yearafter the country's invasion of Ukraine. Asked about her Russian background, the Moscow-born player said: ""I've been playing for Kazakhstan for a long time. I'm really happy representing Kazakhstan. They believed in me. ""There is no more question about how I feel."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Jabeur's 'impossible' 360-degree spin shot Jabeur's story is one of an inspirational late bloomer who lacked patience in her younger days before finding the right mentality to complement her talent. That has enabled her to win WTA tournaments, rise up the rankings and regularly break down barriers. Known as the 'Minister of Happiness' in her country, Jabeur is a popular figure in Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa as she continues to be a trailblazer. ""I'm a proud Tunisian woman here today and I know in Tunisia they are going crazy right now,"" she said. ""I try to inspire as much as I can and I want to see more Arab and African players on the tour."" On the basis of their rankings, Jabeur was the overwhelming favourite against Maria - and that eventually was borne out in a compelling contest. Both players have a similar style, keen to use their slice and play with variety, and it made for an entertaining match. After an edgy start by both players, Jabeur's extra quality shone through in the first set. Immediately Maria's serve came under pressure in an eight-minute opening game, the German eventually holding after seeing off two break points. However, she was unable to withstand more pressure in her next service game and Jabeur moved into a lead she would not relinquish in the opening set. The third seed appeared to be cruising towards a routine win when she earned two more break points in the second game of the second set. But Maria saved those and it sparked a switch of momentum. Perhaps it should not have been surprising, considering Maria had fought back from a set down in three of her previous five matches - including her quarter-final win over fellow German Jule Niemeier. Maria decisively broke in the fourth game and, after failing to break again for the set in the eighth, served it out to the delight of the 15,000 fans who were desperate for the action to be prolonged. Ominously for Maria, Jabeur's level returned at the start of the decider. Jabeur broke for a 2-0 lead with a forehand passing winner, and from there she coasted to a victory which she said would leave her fellow Tunisians ""celebrating like crazy"" back home. ""On the court we knew both that we will go out and do our best, and after we knew that we still were going to be friends,"" Maria said. ""She's an amazing person. I'm really happy for her and I hope she can win it.""

As the only player left with any Grand Slam final experience, Halep was the heavy favourite at a venue where she has won 12 straight matches. However, she was overpowered from the off by Rybakina, who used her big serve and equally giant groundstrokes to wrongfoot Halep. The Romanian faced at least one break point in each of her first five service games, let down by a first-serve rate of 53% and nine double faults. Rybakina showed no sign of nerves, bringing up three set points in the first with an 118mph ace, before converting on a long Halep forehand. Her momentum continued in the second set, with Halep saving a break point in her first service game before coughing up back-to-back double faults to leave her in serious trouble. Halep managed to get the break back and did it to love, stringing together three points for the first time in the match, but another double fault in the next game handed the lead back to Rybakina. From then, Halep's shoulders dropped, and Rybakina needed no further encouragement, again racing through her service games to put Halep under pressure. The frustration was evident when Halep, serving to stay in the match at 5-3, went from 40-15 up to deuce on yet another double fault. She stood for a long time, leaning on her racquet, hand on her thigh as the crowd attempted to urge her on. However, a wonderful return of serve from Rybakina caught the line to stun both Halep and the crowd. ""She deserved to win today with the way I played,"" Halep said. ""Somehow I think I gave her the perfect ball to do her game.""

PM's resignation speech in full,"This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson announces resignation as Conservative leader Boris Johnson stepped out of No 10 to the sound of applause from some political supporters, Downing St colleagues and his wife. Here is his resignation speech in full: ""Good afternoon everybody. ""It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore a new prime minister. ""And I've agreed with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of our backbench MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week. ""And I've today appointed a Cabinet to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place. ""So I want to say to the millions of people who voted for us in 2019, many of them voting Conservative for the first time, thank you for that incredible mandate, the biggest Conservative majority since 1987, the biggest share of the vote since 1979. ""And the reason I have fought so hard in the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person was not just because I wanted to do so, but because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you to continue to do what we promised in 2019. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments ""And of course, I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this government, from getting Brexit done to settling our relations with the Continent for over half a century, reclaiming the power for this country to make its own laws in Parliament, getting us all through the pandemic, delivering the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe, the fastest exit from lockdown, and in the last few months, leading the West in standing up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine. ""And let me say now, to the people of Ukraine, that I know that we in the UK will continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes. ""And at the same time in this country, we've been pushing forward a vast programme of investment in infrastructure and skills and technology - the biggest for a century. Because if I have one insight into human beings, it is that genius and talent and enthusiasm and imagination are evenly distributed throughout the population. ""But opportunity is not, and that's why we must keep levelling up, keep unleashing the potential of every part of the United Kingdom. And if we can do that, in this country, we will be the most prosperous in Europe. ""And in the last few days, I tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much and when we have such a vast mandate and when we're actually only a handful of points behind in the polls, even in mid-term, after quite a few months of pretty relentless sledging and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally. ""And I regret not to have been successful in those arguments and of course it's painful not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself. ""But as we've seen at Westminster, the herd instinct is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves. Boris Johnson made his speech in front of the cameras... ""And my friends in politics, no-one is remotely indispensable and our brilliant and Darwinian system will produce another leader, equally committed to taking this country forward through tough times. ""Not just helping families to get through it, but changing and improving the way we do things, cutting burdens on businesses and families and yes, cutting taxes, because that is the way to generate the growth and the income we need to pay for great public services. ""And to that new leader, I say whoever he or she may be, I say I will give you as much support as I can. And to you, the British public. ""I know that there will be many people who are relieved and perhaps quite a few who will also be disappointed. And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world. ""But them's the breaks. ...and his wife, baby daughter and other supporters in the crowd ""I want to thank Carrie and our children, and all the members of my family who have had to put up with so much for so long. ""I want to thank the peerless British civil service for all the help and support that you have given our police, our emergency services and, of course, our fantastic NHS, who at (a) critical moment, helped to extend my own period in office, as well as our armed services and our agencies that are so admired around the world. ""And our indefatigable Conservative Party members and supporters whose selfless campaigning makes our democracy possible. I want to thank the wonderful staff here at Chequers - here at Number 10, and of course at Chequers. And our fantastic prop force detectives, the one group by the way, who never leak. ""Above all, I want to thank you, the British public, for the immense privilege that you have given me and I want you to know that from now on until the new prime minister is in place, your interests will be served and the government of the country will be carried on. ""Being prime minister is an education in itself. I have travelled to every part of the United Kingdom and, in addition to the beauty of our natural world, I have found so many people possessed of such boundless British originality and so willing to tackle old problems in new ways that I know that even if things can sometimes seem dark now, our future together is golden. ""Thank you all very much. Thank you.""

Officers 'shared images of suicide victim's body',"This video can not be played The father said he remains ""physically sick"" about how his son's death was treated Two NI police officers have been investigated for more than three years over allegations they manipulated a person who died by suicide's body and shared photos and a video online. One of the officers has been suspended with full pay while the Police Ombudsman investigates. It is part of a wider investigation encompassing 11 separate but related incidents spanning several years. Several arrests have been made, the police ombudsman said. Warning: Graphic content If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story,help and support can be found at BBC Action Line. ""There are multiple suspects, including police officers and civilians, in Northern Ireland as well as in England,"" Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson added. The investigation is looking at a range of possible offences including misconduct, harassment and the suspected supply of drugs. Ms Anderson said the allegations around the two Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers were harrowing. At a Northern Ireland Policing Board meeting on Thursday, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne apologised to the family, adding that he ""just cannot imagine how harrowing this might be"". The victim's sister told BBC NI Spotlight that her brother's genitalia had been exposed in one of the photographs. ""No family should have had to endure the pain and suffering that has been caused by these images,"" Ms Anderson said. The family of the man who died by suicide from Belfast has spoken anonymously to BBC NI's Spotlight team about the alleged actions of the two officers, who were at the scene after their loved one's body was discovered in 2017. They said the allegations have worsened their trauma, while the family's lawyer compared the case to that of the two Met Police constables jailed fortaking and sharing photographs of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry. The man's father said he was ""physically sick to this day"" over the allegations. ""Those police officers were in the house while I was there - asked me to leave the room - and I done everything they asked me to at the time. ""And all that keeps coming back to me is why did I leave the room, because that must have been when they done it, when they took the photographs."" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told the policing board that suspension was a ""neutral act in employment"" and that the PSNI had to abide by the law. He added that they are ""sometimes caught on a rock and a hard place in trying to get that right"". The father was first informed of the allegations by Police Ombudsman investigators 18 months after his son died. ""They informed me that two police officers had been questioned regarding my son and photographs that might have been taken of my son,"" he told BBC Spotlight. He said the family was told ""it was a very serious affair and we weren't to discuss it"". The full details of what was alleged to have happened at the scene were drip-fed to the family over a number of meetings. The man's sister told Spotlight the two officers allegedly moved the body around the room in certain poses for pictures and for a video. The family also heard they added to pictures ""an exclamation bubble coming out of my brother's mouth making fun of the way that he was"". The sister added that, during one meeting, the ombudsman and a Scotland Yard officer told her that her brother's genitals had been exposed in one of the photographs. The same officer also allegedly photoshopped a speech bubble onto one of the photographs of the body and shared it on social media. She also said she believed the word ""taig"", a derogatory term for Catholics, was among the language used in the speech bubble. The sister added that she could not comprehend why anyone would be so cruel as to mock someone who had died by suicide. The chief constable said: ""There is no place not just for behaviour like this but for the added insult if you like of sectarian comments which would almost make your stomach churn if the issues in terms weren't bad enough."" In the five years since the suicide, no charges have been brought against the two police officers but a file has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). The family's lawyer PÃ¡draig Ã Muirigh said the five-year wait for justice was unacceptable. He pointed to the case of Metropolitan Police officers Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis who were jailed for two years after they photographed the bodies of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, and shared the images on WhatsApp. ""I appreciate some investigations are more complex than others but we're five years on,"" said Mr Ã Muirigh. ""We've had a similar case across the water in similar circumstances and that case has moved on."" The PSNI said it expected ""the highest standards of professionalism and integrity"" from its officers and staff He added: ""There will be huge public interest in this case and I think the family and the wider public has a right to know why someone has been suspended so long on full pay."" Northern Ireland's Police Ombudsman said it was ""vitally important that every aspect of this case is fully and thoroughly investigated"". Ms Anderson said the incident was part of a ""much broader and more complex case encompassing investigations into 11 separate and related incidents spanning several years"". ""Many of these matters became apparent between 2017 and 2020, either through new complaints or as a result of enquiries by my investigators. The most recent relevant complaint was received in 2020."" She added that: The potential offences under investigation include computer misuse, data protection breaches, misconduct in a public office, harassment, the suspected supply of illegal drugs, and the suspected theft, possession and supply of prescription drugs There are multiple suspects, including police officers and civilians, in Northern Ireland and England The investigation has included a number of arrests and searches, with more than 30 hours of interviews conducted and more than 60 electronic devices seized The ombudsman's investigation is now complete, with a file sent to the PPS ""After the criminal aspects have been concluded, I will consider recommendations to the chief constable in terms of disciplinary action,"" Ms Anderson said. ""All of those impacted by these incidents can be assured that we have given this case the priority and meticulous attention that it deserves, and we will continue to do so.""Â Â BBC Spotlight has contacted the solicitor representing the police officer suspended on full pay for comment. PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton confirmed an officer had been suspended while the investigation was ongoing. ""We expect the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all of our police officers and staff in accordance with the standards contained in the Police Service of Northern Ireland's code of ethics,"" he said. ""Breaches of the law and the code will be thoroughly investigated and robustly dealt with in accordance with the procedures laid out in our conduct regulations. ""I would encourage anyone who suspects a member of our service of abusing their position, in any manner, to report it to us, or to the ombudsman's office. ""You can be assured that the matter will be investigated thoroughly."" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton confirmed an officer had been suspended The man's sister said she had lost all confidence and trust in the PSNI because of the way the case has been handled. ""I couldn't even lift the phone and dial 999 now if I was in an emergency. I wouldn't want them near me or my family because they can't be trusted."" These latest revelations about alleged police misconduct followa BBC Spotlight investigation, Police, WhatsApp & Whistleblowers(currently on BBC iPlayer), which brought forward allegations made by two PSNI whistleblowers. They alleged serious misconduct and neglect by some officers in one of the largest police districts in Northern Ireland. Listen to Mandy's interview with the familyon BBC Sounds here.

Senator faces trial over UK organ-harvesting plotIke Ekweremadu is said to have arranged the transport of a young man to the UK for organ-harvesting.London,"Ike Ekweremadu has been a senator in Nigeria since 2003 A prominent Nigerian senator and his wife who are accused of plotting to harvest a man's kidney in the UK will face trial at the Old Bailey. Ike Ekweremadu, 60, and Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, 55, are alleged to have transported a 21-year-old man from Nigeria to London. Prosecutors allege the couple planned to have his kidney removed so it could be given to their daughter. The Ekweremadus will next appear at the Old Bailey on 4 August. The alleged victim is said to have refused to consent to the procedure after undergoing tests at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. It is alleged the Ekweremadus treated him as a slave before he escaped and went to Staines police station, Surrey. The couple were arrested at Heathrow Airport on 21 June after arriving on a flight from Turkey. They both appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier on Thursday following previous hearings at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court last month. Mr Ekweremadu is charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, while his wife is charged with arranging or facilitating travel of another person with a view to exploitation. The couple were not asked to enter pleas, but the court heard they have indicated not guilty pleas. They deny there was a criminal conspiracy, and will say no exploitation occurred, it was said. Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram remanded them in custody ahead of their next appearance at the Old Bailey. He lifted a reporting restriction on the complainant, who was previously described as a child. Due to the nature of the charge, the complainant still has anonymity despite the fact he is over 18.

House prices defy expectations to hit record,"House prices hit a fresh record in June, according to Halifax, despite expectations the rising cost of living in the UK would dampen demand. The mortgage lender said the average house price reached Â£294,845 in June after rising by 1.8% - the steepest monthly increase since 2007. Halifax said a lack of available homes for sale was lifting prices as well as a shift towards people buying larger, detached homes. But it expects price growth will slow. Halifax said that the housing market had, so far, been largely insulated from the rising cost of living. ""This is partly because, right now, the rise in the cost of living is being felt most by people on lower incomes, who are typically less active in buying and selling houses. ""In contrast, higher earners are likely to be able to use extra funds saved during the pandemic,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. House prices rose by 13% in the year to June, which Halifax said was the highest rate since late 2004. It said demand for bigger, detached houses had lifted prices for these properties by 13.9% over the past year compared to a 7.6% increase for flats. Halifax expects, however, that the ""increased pressure on household budgets from inflation and higher interest rates should weigh more heavily on the housing market, given the impact this has on affordability"" ""So while it may come later than previously anticipated, a slowing of house price growth should still be expected in the months ahead,"" said Mr Galley. The Bank of England has announced a series of interest rate rises in recent months in an attempt to stem soaring inflation, lifting mortgage rates for some borrowers. Northern Ireland saw the largest rise in house prices, with an increase of 15.2% in the year to June to take the average to Â£187,833. Wales also recorded sharp growth of 14.3% to Â£219,281. The average house price in Scotland also hit a new record, rising 9.9% over the year to Â£201,549, ""breaking through Â£200,000 for the first time in history"" said Halifax.

"Ukraine investigating 21,000 alleged war crimes","Ukraine says it has uncovered multiple mass graves in Bucha and other towns near Kyiv that were briefly seized by Russian troops Ukraine says it is investigating more than 21,000 war crimes and crimes of aggression allegedly committed by Russia since the start of its invasion. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told the BBC she was receiving reports of between 200 to 300 war crimes a day. She admitted that many trials would be held in absentia, but stressed that it was ""a question of justice"" to continue with the prosecutions. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. It denies all war crimes allegations. Speaking to the BBC's World Service Outside Source programme, Ms Venediktova warned that Russian soldiers who killed, tortured or raped civilians ""should understand that it's only a question of time when they all will be in court"". She said that although her team was working in regions across Ukraine, it was unable to investigate all cases ""properly and effectively"" because of a lack of access to some people and areas. This was an apparent reference to Ukraine's territories occupied by Russian troops. In May, Ms Venediktova said that about 600 suspects had already been identified and 80 prosecutions had begun. The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, wassentenced to life in prisonfor killing a civilian in May. Ukraine says it has uncovered multiple mass graves in Bucha, Borodyanka and other towns near the capital Kyiv that were briefly seized by Russian troops. The International Criminal Court has described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"", dispatching its largest team of detectives ever to the country to assist in multiple investigations. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. The man who came back from the dead Ukraine's prosecutors wrestle with a new role: war crimes investigators An execution-style killing on a street in Bucha On the ground, Ukraine's military said Russian troops were preparing for an offensive in the eastern Donetsk region, shelling several towns. Russia captured nearly all of the neighbouring Luhansk region over the weekend, part of its attempts to seize the wider Donbas area. In its update, Ukraine's military said its forces were under intense pressure but had so far held off Russian forces. Residents of Slovyansk, a key city in Ukrainian hands, were earlier urged to evacuate further west- a day after a deadly Russian attack on a local market. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said ""artillery from our Western partners had started working very powerfully, so the losses of the occupiers will only increase"".

Senator faces trial over UK organ-harvesting plot,"Ike Ekweremadu has been a senator in Nigeria since 2003 A prominent Nigerian senator and his wife who are accused of plotting to harvest a man's kidney in the UK will face trial at the Old Bailey. Ike Ekweremadu, 60, and Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, 55, are alleged to have transported a 21-year-old man from Nigeria to London. Prosecutors allege the couple planned to have his kidney removed so it could be given to their daughter. The Ekweremadus will next appear at the Old Bailey on 4 August. The alleged victim is said to have refused to consent to the procedure after undergoing tests at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. It is alleged the Ekweremadus treated him as a slave before he escaped and went to Staines police station, Surrey. The couple were arrested at Heathrow Airport on 21 June after arriving on a flight from Turkey. They both appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier on Thursday following previous hearings at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court last month. Mr Ekweremadu is charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, while his wife is charged with arranging or facilitating travel of another person with a view to exploitation. The couple were not asked to enter pleas, but the court heard they have indicated not guilty pleas. They deny there was a criminal conspiracy, and will say no exploitation occurred, it was said. Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram remanded them in custody ahead of their next appearance at the Old Bailey. He lifted a reporting restriction on the complainant, who was previously described as a child. Due to the nature of the charge, the complainant still has anonymity despite the fact he is over 18.

"UK debt on unsustainable path, watchdog saysSoaring energy prices and an ageing population risk putting more pressure on the economy, a report warns.Business","UK debt is on an ""unsustainable path"" unless spending is tightened and taxes are raised, the government's independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said soaring energy prices and pressures from an ageing population risked tipping the UK into a recession. Moving away from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones could also hit tax revenues, the OBR said. It forecast debt levels could more than treble in 50 years' time. High inflation is driving up interest payments. In May they hit Â£7.6bn, the highest level for that month on record and a Â£3.1bn jump from a year earlier. Inflation pushes UK interest costs to May record What is GDP and how does it affect me? People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise In its fiscal risks and sustainability report, the OBR said the government had already spent as much this year, 1.25% of GDP, to help households cope with the cost-of-living crisis as it did supporting the economy through the 2008 financial crisis. The OBR said bringing debt back to 75% of GDP, the level at which it stabilised in the government's pre-pandemic March 2020 Budget, ""would need taxes to rise, spending to fall, or a combination of both"". ""The pressures of an ageing population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term,"" the OBR said. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars from 2030. Fuel duties are currently a big source of tax revenue. The Office for Budget Responsibility has for the first time combined its assessment of the sustainability of the government's finances with risks from wars, trade tensions, cyber attacks and the net zero transition. The overall picture is a sobering one for whoever takes over in Downing Street - a clear indication that tax rises will be required. Growth is assumed to be smaller, as the economy is less productive. Long-standing demographic challenges that will raise spending and old age dependency, have become worse, says the OBR, leading to government spending being concentrated on the NHS, social care and pensions payments and other areas of spending being squeezed. At the same time some sources of tax revenue, such as fuel duty, are on course to disappear entirely. The OBR also model the risk of today's energy shock persisting, a major cyber attack, and the need for a significant rise in defence spending to deal with new tensions around the world. The result would be ballooning government debts. While the portals of political power are focused very much on the short term, the OBR report is a warning of very many future risks, currently gaining little attention. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. In May 2022, it was Â£2.36 trillion. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 95.8% ofgross domestic product (GDP). The OBR said the Ukraine war, soaring energy prices and long-term pressure on the nation's finances ""add up to a challenging outlook for this and future governments as they steer the public finances through inevitable future shocks"". ""Many threats remain, with rising inflation potentially tipping the economy into recession, continued uncertainty about our future trading relationship with the EU, a resurgence in Covid cases, a changing global climate, and rising interest rates all continuing to hang over the fiscal outlook,"" it said. Households are currently being hit by higher fuel, food and energy costs. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 9.1%. It has led to many people cutting back on spending, especially on food and car journeys,according to a BBC-commissioned survey. It has also fuelled fears that the UK could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods -after the economy shrank in March and April. But the OBR said the current energy price woes may not be as bad as that seen in the 1970s. ""While the oil crises of the 1970s saw global energy prices rise by a similar magnitude as we have seen in the wake of the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are reasons to believe that the overall impact on inflation, output, and unemployment will be less severe and less persistent this time around,"" it added.

The PM who broke all the rules,"Could this really be the end? Boris Johnson's latest departure from Parliament has a feeling of finality about it. The last time he stood down as an MP, in 2008, it was in triumph. He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street. Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking. His reaction to thePrivileges Committee report,externalis vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to ""Mystic Meg"" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen. Johnson deliberately misled on Partygate, MPs find What perks will Boris Johnson get as an ex-MP? Boris Johnson Partygate report at a glance He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before. And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. He has already earned more than Â£5m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister. He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a Â£3.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat. There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities. But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality. From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be ""world king"", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes. He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. Boris Johnson as host of the BBC show, Have I Got News For You, in 2002 One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission. The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs. He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates. In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: ""Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. ""I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else."" Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: ""Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,"" At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron. Brimming with ambition: Boris Johnson was president of the Oxford Union in 1986 After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings. As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire. Things did not go smoothly. He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard. He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city. He survived ""Operation Scouse Grovel"", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt. Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered. He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way. He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre. Boris and Carrie Johnson got married in May 2020 In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021. It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician. His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party. His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. Comic cheerleader: Boris Johnson suspended on a zip wire in a stunt to promote the 2012 London Olympics In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals. Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a ""career psychopath"". When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary. He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into ""the status of a colony"". When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job. He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May. In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019. After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to ""Get Brexit Done"", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide. Boris Johnson during the 2016 Brexit campaign in front of a Leave EU bus controversially covered with the words ""We send the EU Â£350 million a week"" The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall. His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted ""it could have gone either way"". As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic. He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world. But his political problems were mounting up. In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street. Dominic Cummings leaving Downing Street, November 2020 Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen. Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules. Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose. The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working. Boris Johnson and has been a staunch supporter of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street. A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to ""get on with the job"" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality. He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership. He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party. He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards. But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict. Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills. But the road back looks like a long and steep one. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM appoints new cabinet ahead of resignation,"Conservative MP James Cleverly is among those given cabinet roles Boris Johnson has filled vacant posts in his cabinet, after a wave of resignations left roles empty and shattered the PM's authority. Mr Johnson has quit as Tory leader and these ministers will remain in place until a successor is elected. Greg Clark has been named new levelling up secretary, and James Cleverly as education secretary. And Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, as Wales secretary, in the swift reshuffle. Mr Buckland said the new cabinet would ensure the ""day-to-day operation"" of the government, with Mr Johnson staying on as ""caretaker"" PM. Mr Johnson has pledgednot to make major policy decisionsbefore his successor is chosen, with a contest expected to conclude by September. Follow updates live as Boris Johnson resigns as Tory leader Shailesh Vara becomes Northern Ireland secretary, Kit Malthouse has been appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Andrew Stephenson as minister without portfolio. Mr Johnson has also moved to fill the raft of more junior positions left by the avalanche of resignations that triggered his departure. Among these Will Quince, whoresigned as an education ministerover being given ""inaccurate briefings"" about the Chris Pincher affair, returns to his old position. And Johnny Mercer, who resigned as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans in Northern Ireland, has returned to government as a Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for veterans. Edward Timpson becomes the new solicitor general, with Paul Scully and Marcus Jones becoming ministers at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. However, the BBC understands, government whips are having discussions about how to get current legislation through Parliament with so few junior ministers. In his resignation speech, Mr Johnson said he had appointed a new a cabinet to serve until a successor is elected to replace him as Tory leader and prime minister. But opposition parties and some Tory MPs have urged Mr Johnson to go now to avoid government paralysis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson must not be allowed to ""cling on"" in No 10 once he has resigned, and he threatened to use a confidence motion in Parliament to oust him. Former prime minister Sir John Major said it was ""unwise and may be unsustainable"" for Mr Johnson to remain in office until a new Conservative Party leader is elected. Sir John suggested Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab could serve as acting prime minister until a new leader is elected. Or, he said, Tory MPs could elect the new leader who would become prime minister, with party members then asked to endorse the decision. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments The newly appointed levelling up secretary said he would do his best to ""provide stability"". Mr Clark, who replaceda sacked Michael Gove, tweeted: ""We have a duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government in the weeks ahead."" Other cabinet ministers will remain in post, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The appointments follow a dramatic 48 hours in which dozens of ministers - including former chancellor Rishi Sunak - resigned and plunged Mr Johnson's leadership into crisis. Mr Sunak's replacement as chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was later among the ministers urging the PM to quit. Mr Johnson resisted the calls until Thursday morning, when it became clear that he had lost the confidence of his MPs and that the government could no longer function. Less than three years ago, Mr Johnson won an historic landslide victory in a general election - but he has been dogged by controversy in recent months, including a fine for breaking his own lockdown laws. The revolt this week was triggered by revelations about the prime minister's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher. Now Mr Johnson has stood down, a party leadership contest has been triggered and the eventual winner will become the next prime minister. Sir Graham - the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs - is expected to set out the timetable to nominate Mr Johnson's replacement next week. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country will vote for the winner. Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a former joint secretary of the 1922 Committee, told the BBC the process to whittle down the list of candidates to two could be done before MPs break for summer recess on 21 July. Attorney General Suella Braverman and former Brexit minister Steve Baker have both indicated they will run for the leadership, with more senior Tories expected to throw their hats into the ring in the coming days. Ms Truss and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who are both popular with Tory members - have been tipped as potential frontrunners.

"Make downblousing criminal offence, say law chiefs","Law chiefs want the act of taking photos down a woman's top without consent, or ""downblousing"", to be made illegal in England and Wales. New proposals also aim to protect victims of intimate image abuse and revenge porn by changing current laws. The Law Commission, which reviews and updates legislation, is also calling for a ban on sharing pornographic deepfakes without consent. The government said it would carefully consider the recommendations. At the moment in England and Wales, acts such as upskirting or voyeurism are criminalised, but the recommendations would extend this further. Northern Irish Justice Minister Naomi Long, who strengthened the law in this area in Northern Ireland, told the BBC: ""New offences have been created for upskirting, downblousing and cyber-flashing where those convicted will be liable to a maximum of two years' imprisonment. ""I believe these new provisions will offer greater protection in Northern Ireland and that it will have a real, tangible and positive effect for victims,"" she said. In Scotland, upskirting has been banned since 2010, with the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009, which outlaws sexual crimes, amended to include upskirting in a widened definition of voyeurism. Prosecutions of the crime in Scotland have remained low since it was brought into scope, with an average of three upskirting prosecutions a year between 2011 and 2018. Numerous victims of intimate image abuse have described how distressing the experience has been. Emily Hunt, who was filmed naked in a hotel room while she was unconscious in 2015,spent five years campaigningfor her perpetrator to be brought to justice. ""It completely derailed my life,"" she said. Prosecutors told Ms Hunt that what the man did was not illegal, until the law was clarified by the Court of Appeal. ""They told me it was not against the law to video someone naked if you were in the same room as them. I started campaigning, trying to let politicians know that they need up-to-date laws. ""The current 'patchwork' of criminal offences has not kept pace with how technology is evolving."" Sophisticated technology means there are more pornographic deepfakes out there too; videos manipulated so that the original face is replaced with somebody else's. There is also tech that can let users ""nudify"" pictures. Gaps in the law mean perpetrators can evade prosecution for actions that cause severe distress and long-term harm to those targeted. Victims should also receive anonymity for life, the commission said. Folami Prehaye became a victim of revenge pornwhen her former partner Thomas Samuel posted explicit pictures of her online. He shared the images with her friends, family and strangers, and was given a six-month suspended sentence for harassment and distributing indecent images. Like Emily, Folami has now become a campaigner for change, and founded the group Victims of Image Crime. ""As someone who has first-hand experience, I felt it important for any new suggested changes to take on board the voices of those who have fought for justice,"" she told the BBC. ""My hope is that the Law Commission has covered 'threats to share', anonymity for all experiencers and the need for them not to prove intent."" The key proposals are: It would be an offence for someone to intentionally take or share an intimate image of a person without their consent This new base offence would apply regardless of the perpetrator's motivation and could lead to a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment If someone takes or shares an intimate image without consent to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, alarm or distress, threatens to share an intimate image, or installs hidden equipment, they could receive a sentence of two to three years' imprisonment Prof Clare McGlynn, from Durham University, said the Law Commission's proposals are a welcome step - especially making the taking or sharing of an intimate image without consent a base offence. ""The breach of privacy and breach of consent is the core wrong, so it's right to focus on that,"" she said, Reforms would make it easier to prosecute for a wider range of behaviours, with tougher sentences handed out for the most serious abuse. This video can not be played Georgie has been campaigning to change the law around intimate image abuse But Prof McGlynn adds that the proposed recommendations are ""long overdue"". ""We really do need prompt action because the government and politicians could have taken steps years ago and saved thousands of young people from being harmed by intimate image abuse. ""And that's what we need to remember - every day that we're not introducing these new laws, people, especially young women, are being harmed, and some of these harms are life-threatening."" Prof Penney Lewis, the law commissioner for criminal law, said: ""Sharing intimate images of a person without their consent can be incredibly distressing and harmful for victims, with the experience often scarring them for life. ""Current laws on taking or sharing sexual or nude images of someone without their consent are inconsistent, based on a narrow set of motivations and do not go far enough to cover disturbing and abusive new behaviours born in the smartphone era."" However, Kate Isaacs, founder of Not Your Porn - which aims to hold the porn industry accountable for the distribution and commercialisation of non-consensual material - said: ""The thing that concerns me the most is it doesn't look like there's anything in terms of profiting from [image-based sexual abuse] or platform responsibility here, which is really worrying. ""Addressing the installation of equipment such as a hidden camera is all very well and good, but I've worked on a number of cases with women who have been secretly recorded without their consent and then that footage has been uploaded to a platform that has allowed someone to profit from that content."" A government spokesman said: ""Nearly 1,000 abusers have been convicted since we outlawed 'revenge porn'. ""With the Online Safety Bill, we will force internet firms to protect people better from a range of image-based abuse - including deepfakes. ""But we asked the Commission to explore whether the law could be strengthened further to keep the public safer. ""We will carefully consider its recommendations and respond in due course.""

Crisis-hit Sri Lanka asks Putin for help to buy fuelThe country says it is close to running out of petrol amid its worst economic crisis since 1948.Business,"Sri Lankan police during a protest in Colombo on Wednesday Sri Lanka's president says he has asked Russia's Vladimir Putin to help his cash-strapped nation import fuel, as it faces its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he ""had a very productive"" discussion with Mr Putin. It comes after Sri Lanka's energy minister warned at the weekend that the country may soon run out of petrol. On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo to protest against the government. ""I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel,"" Mr Rajapaksa tweeted in reference to his conversation with the Russian leader. Mr Rajapaksa also said he had ""humbly made a request"" for flights between Moscow and Colombo to resume, after the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot suspended services last month. ""We unanimously agreed that strengthening bilateral relations in sectors such as tourism, trade and culture was paramount in reinforcing the friendship our two nations share,"" he added.

The country has already purchased oil from Russia in recent months to help bolster fuel supplies during the crisis, and the government has signalled that it is willing to buy more from the energy-rich country. Attempts by Mr Rajapaksa to resolve Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, including securing financial support from India and China, have so far failed to end weeks of shortages of fuel, power, food and other essential items. On Sunday,energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the country only had enough petrol left for less than a dayunder regular demand. Last week, authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve its dwindling fuel stocks. UK reinstates warning against travel to Sri Lanka What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? On Thursday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised its key interest rates by one percentage point to tackle the soaring cost of living in the country. The lending rate was raised to 15.5%, while the deposit rate was increased to 14.5%, the highest in 21 years. It comes as annual inflation hit a record high of 54.6% in June as the cost of food rose by more than 80%. Hundreds of protesters had a day earlier on Wednesday gathered near the parliament building in Colombo as they launched what they called the ""final push"" to remove Mr Rajapaksa's government. This week,the UK reinstated advice against all but essential travel to Sri Lankabecause of civil unrest in the country. The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter ""demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice"". Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate one's travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said. Anbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia Editor, BBC News Sri Lanka desperately needs the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin for both fuel and tourists, which are both vital to rescuing the country's economy. The island nation has virtually run out of fuel, crippling businesses and public transport. It is struggling to get oil shipments from its usual suppliers in the Gulf or elsewhere due to a lack of foreign currency as well as banking and logistical difficulties. Western nations have imposed restrictions on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is clearly willing to take the risk of triggering displeasure in Western capitals. To add to Colombo's woes, Aeroflot suspended Moscow-Colombo passenger flight services last month after a Sri Lankan court briefly detained one of its planes following a commercial dispute over payment. Russians accounted for almost a fifth of total tourist arrivals in the months before the war started in Ukraine. Even if the flights resume, it may not be easy to attract Russian tourists as they could find it difficult to pay for things while they are on holiday. Several Russian banks have been disconnected from using the SWIFT international payment system and Visa and Master credit cards have suspended Russian operations in response to Moscow's war on Ukraine. Sri Lanka has seen its foreign exchange reserves shrink due to economic mismanagement and the impact of the pandemic. As a result it has struggled to pay for imports of essential goods, including fuel, food and medicine. In May, it defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history after a 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (Â£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired. The country is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a Â£3bn bailout. Sri Lanka's government has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

The country has already purchased oil from Russia in recent months to help bolster fuel supplies during the crisis, and the government has signalled that it is willing to buy more from the energy-rich country. Attempts by Mr Rajapaksa to resolve Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, including securing financial support from India and China, have so far failed to end weeks of shortages of fuel, power, food and other essential items. On Sunday,energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the country only had enough petrol left for less than a dayunder regular demand. Last week, authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve its dwindling fuel stocks. UK reinstates warning against travel to Sri Lanka What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? On Thursday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised its key interest rates by one percentage point to tackle the soaring cost of living in the country. The lending rate was raised to 15.5%, while the deposit rate was increased to 14.5%, the highest in 21 years. It comes as annual inflation hit a record high of 54.6% in June as the cost of food rose by more than 80%. Hundreds of protesters had a day earlier on Wednesday gathered near the parliament building in Colombo as they launched what they called the ""final push"" to remove Mr Rajapaksa's government. This week,the UK reinstated advice against all but essential travel to Sri Lankabecause of civil unrest in the country. The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter ""demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice"". Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate one's travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said. Anbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia Editor, BBC News Sri Lanka desperately needs the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin for both fuel and tourists, which are both vital to rescuing the country's economy. The island nation has virtually run out of fuel, crippling businesses and public transport. It is struggling to get oil shipments from its usual suppliers in the Gulf or elsewhere due to a lack of foreign currency as well as banking and logistical difficulties. Western nations have imposed restrictions on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is clearly willing to take the risk of triggering displeasure in Western capitals. To add to Colombo's woes, Aeroflot suspended Moscow-Colombo passenger flight services last month after a Sri Lankan court briefly detained one of its planes following a commercial dispute over payment. Russians accounted for almost a fifth of total tourist arrivals in the months before the war started in Ukraine. Even if the flights resume, it may not be easy to attract Russian tourists as they could find it difficult to pay for things while they are on holiday. Several Russian banks have been disconnected from using the SWIFT international payment system and Visa and Master credit cards have suspended Russian operations in response to Moscow's war on Ukraine. Sri Lanka has seen its foreign exchange reserves shrink due to economic mismanagement and the impact of the pandemic. As a result it has struggled to pay for imports of essential goods, including fuel, food and medicine. In May, it defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history after a 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (Â£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired. The country is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a Â£3bn bailout. Sri Lanka's government has said it needs $5bn this year in support from the international community, including the IMF. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

Call for higher welfare farming for Parma ham pigsAn investigation finds supermarkets sell imported ham produced under conditions banned in the UK.Science & Environment,"Animal welfare campaigners want all crates banned from pig farming Animal welfare campaigners say it is time supermarkets stopped selling premium ham produced by EU farmers still using methods banned in the UK. Compassion in World Farming said most Parma ham on UK shelves is farmed using crates that confine pregnant sows. Called ""sow stalls"", the crates have been banned in the UK since 1999 but their limited use in the EU is legal. Trade body the British Retail Consortium said UK stores led the way in requiring high welfare standards. But it added that it was ""more challenging with speciality hams where the UK has a small share of a highly-regulated product and the focus is on production methods."" Of the UK's top three supermarkets, Sainsbury's said that while sow stalls were used, all its suppliers have to meet ""strict welfare standards"" and their use was limited to a maximum of 28 days. Asda said pigs used in the supply of Parma ham were farmed according to EU welfare legislation. Tesco has yet to respond to the BBC but its welfare policy states that sow stalls are not permitted in its pork supply chain. Meanwhile one retailer, Waitrose, vowed to end the use of sow stalls in any of its pork production, saying: ""Animal welfare is key to our brand. We have led the way for pig welfare in the UK and now we want to ensure that sow stalls have no place in our supply chain by 2025"". Compassion in World Farming (CiWF) said it would like to see all retailers, producers and food companies commit to doing away with all confinement crates used in pig farming. That also includes farrowing crates, which are used to confine sows during and after birth to stop them crushing their piglets and are legal both in the UK and EU. Farrowing crates are used to prevent sows from crushing their piglets. Sarah Moyes, CiWF's senior campaigns manager, said: ""People who pay a premium for products like Parma ham are likely to be shocked to discover that these 'high-end' products are from systems that keep animals in such cruel cages. ""Our investigation reveals that their farms are no better than standard farms - the animals still spend a significant part of their lives in cages."" The European Commission has said it intends to ban all caged farming systems,external, including the use of farrowing crates and sow stalls, possibly implementing new legislation by 2027. A partial ban on individual sow stalls was introduced in the EU in 2013 but they can still be used for the first four weeks in a sow's four-month pregnancy. It is argued that using stalls allows for better individual feeding, protection from aggressive behaviour by other pigs and easier access for veterinary attention. But welfare campaigners say they leave sows little room to move and unable to perform natural and motivated behaviours, such as foraging or interacting socially with other pigs. The UK government, which banned sow stalls in 1999, is also consideringphasing out farrowing crates,external. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Our aim is ultimately for farrowing crates to no longer be necessary, and we continue to work towards this objective."" The National Pig Association estimates 60% of UK sows are kept on indoor pig units and the majority of them give birth and suckle their piglets in farrowing crates. The NPA opposes a ban on farrowing crates,externaland said the 1999 sow stall ban resulted in half the UK pig industry being lost  - only for it to be replaced by EU pork produced using the stalls.

Stranded motorway kitten on road to recoverySmudge the kitten was rescued from the middle of the M18 motorway near Doncaster on Saturday.Sheffield & South Yorkshire,"Anna Leather, who is caring for Smudge, says the kitten has recovered from the motorway rescue A kitten which was rescued from the central reservation of a motorway is said to have made a good recovery from its ordeal. The four-week-old black feline, now called Smudge, was spotted between junctions six and seven on the M18 northbound near Doncaster on Saturday. Motorway traffic was brought to a standstill while a National Highways officer rescued the young cat. Anna Leather, who is caring for her, says she improved after a ""good bath"". It is thought Smudge had been dumped by the side of the motorway and narrowly escaped being run over as traffic thundered past. Traffic officer Gavin Buffam, who rescued the cat, said: ""The first time I tried to scoop her up she decided she didn't like me and wanted to take my finger off. ""I got a good hiss and nearly a good scratch, so I thought I'd leave her be and retreated back to the hard shoulder."" Concerned drivers on the M18 called emergency services after driving past the stranded kitten Colleague Andy Binns, who put a rolling road block in place to allow a second rescue attempt, said: ""If it's living and breathing we deal with everything the same, whether it's ducklings, badgers, foxes, we treat every animal the same - life is precious."" Ms Leather said: ""She looked absolutely awful, full of muck and the parts of debris in her coat were like sandpaper and greasy.

Crisis-hit Sri Lanka asks Putin for help to buy fuel,"Sri Lankan police during a protest in Colombo on Wednesday Sri Lanka's president says he has asked Russia's Vladimir Putin to help his cash-strapped nation import fuel, as it faces its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he ""had a very productive"" discussion with Mr Putin. It comes after Sri Lanka's energy minister warned at the weekend that the country may soon run out of petrol. On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital Colombo to protest against the government. ""I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel,"" Mr Rajapaksa tweeted in reference to his conversation with the Russian leader. Mr Rajapaksa also said he had ""humbly made a request"" for flights between Moscow and Colombo to resume, after the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot suspended services last month. ""We unanimously agreed that strengthening bilateral relations in sectors such as tourism, trade and culture was paramount in reinforcing the friendship our two nations share,"" he added.

It is thought Smudge had been dumped by the side of the motorway and narrowly escaped being run over as traffic thundered past. Traffic officer Gavin Buffam, who rescued the cat, said: ""The first time I tried to scoop her up she decided she didn't like me and wanted to take my finger off. ""I got a good hiss and nearly a good scratch, so I thought I'd leave her be and retreated back to the hard shoulder."" Concerned drivers on the M18 called emergency services after driving past the stranded kitten Colleague Andy Binns, who put a rolling road block in place to allow a second rescue attempt, said: ""If it's living and breathing we deal with everything the same, whether it's ducklings, badgers, foxes, we treat every animal the same - life is precious."" Ms Leather said: ""She looked absolutely awful, full of muck and the parts of debris in her coat were like sandpaper and greasy. ""We gave her a good bath, a good feed and now she can't stop feeding, she's like a pot-bellied pig."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Long Covid midwife's anger over new no-pay rule,"Sarah, with daughter Kyra, feels angry with her treatment A midwife with long Covid has said she feels ""abandoned and angry"". New NHS sickness absence rules mean Sarah Sutton, 44, from Swansea, will not be paid after 1 November unless she is able to return to work. She contracted the virus in 2020 while working as a community midwife at Neath Port Talbot Hospital. The Welsh government said NHS Wales and trade unions agreed the new Covid sickness absence rules, which began on 1 July. Two years after she contracted the virus, Sarah can only walk very short distances with the help of a stick. She also finds it hard to catch her breath and becomes easily fatigued, so the mother-of-four relies on her partner and eldest daughters to care for her. 'My shame over 18-month work absence' Long Covid: What are the symptoms? New NHS Wales Covid absence rules mean she will only receive half pay from this month and nothing  from November. Hospitals can use their discretion to extend sick pay to full pay ""particularly to facilitate a phased return to work"", but Sarah said her present state of health meant she was unlikely to be able to return to what she described as her ""dream job"" in the near future. ""I can't see me being back at work in November and that's going to mean zero pay and there's nothing I can do about it,"" she said. Sarah on holiday before the pandemic and contracting Covid She said ""abandoned"" was the best word to describe her situation, adding: ""We went and did a job. This was before the first lockdown, we didn't have PPE, that's when people were stealing thermometers and hand gels and everything from hospitals. ""We didn't have masks and the focus was all on handwashing and we now know it's airborne, so I'm angry. ""I was doing my job, I was looking after people, I was doing what the NHS does, it cares and then I got ill."" Sarah said she could understand why employers might not want to take on a long Covid sufferer. ""I can't do a job, I'll need a nap after this [interview]. There's not going to be many employers who'll say 'that's OK, go and have a nap whenever you like'. ""I can't focus on things for long enough, I can't focus on a computer screen for long enough. What can I do, who will reasonably employ me? I wouldn't if I was an employer. I'm not useful in any way."" Sarah spent ""thousands of pounds"" on private consultations with a specialist cardiologist in Cardiff and treatments including oxygen therapy and acupuncture in a desperate effort to get well, to no avail. Sarah continues to struggle with the lasting effects of Covid as the world recovers from the pandemic Sarah graduated with first class honours in midwifery in 2019. But in March 2020, just four months into her job as a community midwife, she came home from a shift at Neath Port Talbot Hospital and began experiencing symptoms of fatigue which then turned to difficulty breathing. Her partner was so concerned he called paramedics and she was taken into hospital. She has not worked since. It has been estimated that 96,000 people in Wales are still reporting symptoms of ""long Covid"" - around 3.15%. This is the same estimate as the previous month, which was the highest reported since figures were collated by the Office for National Statistics. In thelatest figures, out on Thursday,,externalan increasing number of people - 41,000 in Wales - were still reporting symptoms more than a year since having Covid. Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported (56%) followed by shortness of breath (31%), loss of smell (22%), and muscle ache (21%). For some people, Long Covid symptoms can include extreme fatigue, joint pain and a high temperature Across the UK, prevalence was greatest in the 35 to 69 age group, in women and in people living in deprived areas. The estimate for Wales is higher than in other UK nations and all English regions apart from the north west, north east and Yorkshire and Humber. In aseparate report last week,external, scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimated that up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid. In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the impact on the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from Â£21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to Â£5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than Â£4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. Until this month Sarah was on full pay, in line with Welsh government Covid sickness absence arrangements. ""My life has been brought to a halt, I can't make any plans. My littlest son Seth is 10, he'll say 'can we do something at the weekend?' and I'll say maybe."" After graduating Sarah started her ""dream job"", but things quickly changed Looking at photographs taken before she contracted Covid, Sarah was a happy, healthy mother and partner who enjoyed the outdoors and went to the gym at least three times a week. But two years of illness have taken their toll. Sarah said long Covid leaves her so tired and breathless that even taking Seth to a party last weekend was ""impossible"". The venue was up a flight of stairs and there was no lift. Also, she could not take him on a tour of his new secondary school, and instead one of the other parents took him around the building while she waited alone in the school hall. Sarah now struggles to get around without help The virus has not only taken her strength, but her ability to be the parent she wants to be, and has even destroyed her memory and concentration. The family is now looking for other ways to keep their heads above water financially. ""Especially with things the way they are, with the cost of living, it's scary,"" Sarah said. Sarah was looking forward to a long career as a midwife after graduating She said she would go ""above and beyond"" when working, like everyone else in the NHS, adding: ""But it feels like no-one is fighting for me apart from me and I haven't got the energy... especially when you're running on empty even before you get out of bed."" The BBC approached Sarah's employer, Swansea Bay University Health Board, and was referred to the Welsh government. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""NHS Wales and trade unions agreed the arrangements for Covid sickness absence from 1 July to support the transition back to existing national terms and conditions for all absences. ""Organisations can look at individual circumstances on a case-by-case basis and apply different pay arrangements.""

House prices defy expectations to hit new record,"House prices hit a fresh record in June, according to Halifax, despite expectations the rising cost of living in the UK would dampen demand. The mortgage lender said the average house price reached Â£294,845 in June after rising by 1.8% - the steepest monthly increase since 2007. Halifax said a lack of available homes for sale was lifting prices as well as a shift towards people buying larger, detached homes. But it expects price growth will slow. Halifax said that the housing market had, so far, been largely insulated from the rising cost of living. ""This is partly because, right now, the rise in the cost of living is being felt most by people on lower incomes, who are typically less active in buying and selling houses. ""In contrast, higher earners are likely to be able to use extra funds saved during the pandemic,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. House prices rose by 13% in the year to June, which Halifax said was the highest rate since late 2004. It said demand for bigger, detached houses had lifted prices for these properties by 13.9% over the past year compared to a 7.6% increase for flats. Halifax expects, however, that the ""increased pressure on household budgets from inflation and higher interest rates should weigh more heavily on the housing market, given the impact this has on affordability"" ""So while it may come later than previously anticipated, a slowing of house price growth should still be expected in the months ahead,"" said Mr Galley. The Bank of England has announced a series of interest rate rises in recent months in an attempt to stem soaring inflation, lifting mortgage rates for some borrowers. Northern Ireland saw the largest rise in house prices, with an increase of 15.2% in the year to June to take the average to Â£187,833. Wales also recorded sharp growth of 14.3% to Â£219,281. The average house price in Scotland also hit a new record, rising 9.9% over the year to Â£201,549, ""breaking through Â£200,000 for the first time in history"" said Halifax.

LiveLivePM clings on as Lewis latest cabinet minister to resign6 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has quit as Conservative leader, saying it is ""clearly now the will"" of Tory MPs that there should be a new leader He pledges to stay on as PM until a successor is chosen - but a growing number of Tory MPs say he has to leave No 10 now Johnson assured cabinet this afternoon he would only act as a caretaker PM while remaining in position, new Welsh Secretary Robert Buckland says But ex-PM Sir John Major says Johnson should go now for the good of the country Labour also says Johnson must leave office, saying they could try to bring a no confidence vote in Parliament Downing Street announces 12 new ministers, filling some of the posts left vacant by the recent wave of resignations Foreign Secretary Liz Truss - a possible leadership contender who has remained silent for days - says her party needs to keep governing until a new leader is found Edited by Nathan Williams We're pausing our live coverage shortly, after a rather eventful day. Here's a round-up of what happened:  Today's coverage was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Emily McGarvey, Marita Maloney, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Aoife Walsh, Adam Durbin and Catherine Evans. As you're probably aware by now, Boris Johnson has resigned as Conservative leader and will step down as prime minister when a replacement is found. But how does that happen? In theory the prime minister could resign immediately and a caretaker could take over - but while there are calls for this from Tory MPs, opposition parties and Conservative Party grandees like former PM John Major - there is currently no indication this will happen. He could also be ousted by a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but this would rely on Tory MPs supporting an opposition motion and voting against their own government - an unlikely scenario. So the most probable course of events to find a new PM is an internal leadership election replaces Johnson as the top Tory. It's been suggested that process could last until October, although it could be much shorter with the replacement of Theresa May as leader only taking two months. Conservative Party leadership votes are split into two sections. In the first phase MPs whittle down a list of colleagues who put their names forward in a series of votes until two final candidates remain. These two final MPs are then put to the party membership to pick who will be the next leader. Read our analysis of how the next few weeks and months could play out - as well as the ins and outs of internal Tory politics -here. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Is the European Union rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's
downfall? Yes but also no. When asked by journalists on Thursday if any extra bottles of champagne
had been ordered in response to news of his resignation, an EU spokesman drily
responded: ""We have a very limited consumption of alcoholic beverages in
the (European) Commission."" This, a presumed dig at Johnson, who recently admitted there was ""a
problem with alcohol"" in UK political circles. He was also accused of tolerating and attending boozy gatherings at
Downing Street during the strict Covid lockdown. All over the European press, Johnson is not beloved in the EU. 'Borexit' screamed Germany's biggest tabloid, Bild on Thursday. It also
chose to write an English headline: ""Bye Bye Boris"". But most EU diplomats I've been chatting to regard the
mass resignations of Conservative ministers around Boris Johnson as
self-serving attempts to save their career rather than signs of disagreement
with his policies, Brexit-related or otherwise. ""This Johnson resignation just means more uncertainty
for us Europeans. More UK inward-looking obsession with its own domestic
dramas, rather than looking outwards towards partners abroad,"" grumbled
one particularly fed-up EU diplomat. Read more We've put together a compilation of the picturescapturing the rise and fall of Boris Johnson- from his days as an Eton schoolboy, his time as London mayor, to the events of his two and a half years as Prime Minister. Here are five iconic shots of his career: Celebrating his successful campaign to be London mayor in 2008 with future PM David Cameron Johnson famously got stuck on a zipwire waving two Union flags during celebrations of the London 2012 Olympics He was a figurehead for the successful Leave campaign during 2016 EU referendum, when he and Michael Gove campaigned for the UK to end its membership Johnson's winning 2019 general election campaign was centred around his pledge to ""get Brexit done"". He was confronted early on in his premiership by the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to his calling the first lockdown in March 2020 He's announced he's standing to be the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. But what do we know about Tom Tugendhat? Here are a few facts about the Tonbridge and Malling MP.  Boris Johnsonhas stood down as Conservative leader, but will continue to serve as PM until the party chooses his successor. When is the next general election due? UK general elections - where all 650 MPs are elected to the House of Commons - have to be held no more than five years apart. Unless an earlier one is called, the next election isn't due until January 2025. Would a new PM need to hold an early election? Now that Johnson has resigned, the Conservative Party will need to choose a new leader. The winner of that contest will become the next PM. The new PM would not be obliged to call an early election - but could do so if they wished. When Gordon Brown took over from Labour prime minister Tony Blair in 2007, for example, he did not hold an early election. How is an early election called? If a PM wants an early election they need to make a ""request"" to the Queen to dissolve Parliament - the official term for closing Parliament in order to hold an election. Read more about the process here Chair
of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat has launched his bid to
become the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. In
an article in the Telegraph newspaper, he says he would bring a ""clean
start"". He writes that he wants to build a ""broad coalition of
colleagues"" to ""bring new energy and ideas to government"" and
""bridge the Brexit divide"". Setting
out his stall, he writes that ""taxes, bluntly, are too high.""
Specifically: ""We should immediately reverse the recent National Insurance
hike and let hard-working people, and employers, keep more of their money. Fuel
tax must come down. And un-conservative tariffs, that push up prices for
consumers, should be dropped."" He
talks about the cost of living as an ""national security issue"" and
says there should be more police on the streets to tackle crime. Kim Pringle believes the current political situation is ""ridiculous"" We've been hearing from people around the country in the wake of Boris Johnson's resignation announcement. InCheltenham, where MP Alex Chalk resigned as solicitor general yesterday, voters have been sharing their views on a seismic day for UK politics. Kim Pringlesays she is ""disgusted"" with politics in Britain, the government and the cabinet. ""They have no
scruples, they have no morals and they have no integrity. And the lies, that
have come since Boris went on his campaign. Itâs just astounding,"" she says. Nichola Vaughan says the government doesn't fully take account of voters' intentions Nichola Vaughan, a self-confessed ""floating voter"", says ""everybody needs to take a deep breath"". She adds: ""I think that people in government need to realise that a lot of people in this county are not London centric, not government centric. We base our views and our votes on the people in our local area...sometimes Iâm Lib Dem, sometimes Iâm Conservative.â  Daksha Mistry says someone needs to take over who can ""command respect"" Also reacting from Cheltenham isDaksha Mistry, who says the country needs a leader with ""credibility"" who can garner respect. âWe were avid supporters of the Conservatives, and heâs [Johnson] pretty much just embarrassed us lately,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, one Tory MP - who quit dramatically from a government post yesterday - told me ministerial posts could prove a challenge to fill. But, they added, some might accept positions if only to ""put the country first"" and keep government functioning. Certainly a few of tonight's appointments have turned heads. Will Quince has returned as an education minister. Remember he quit after being wheeled out to defend Downing Street's handling of the Chris Pincher sexual misconduct allegations - later saying he was ""given assurances"" the prime minister had no knowledge of former allegations against Mr Pincher, which turned out to be incorrect. Johnny Mercer's appointment as a veterans minister has also caused chatter in Westminster circles. In April last year he resigned from this post - saying he was ""forced"" to over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. He gave a series of hostile interviews at the time - saying the government had ""abandoned people"" in a way he couldn't reconcile. Clearly he's been able to reconcile that now.

These new pictures released by No 10 give us an insight into the moments after the prime minister resigned. Prime Minister Boris Johnson walks back through the No 10 door after delivering his statement Here he is hugging his wife Carrie and their children With his son Wilfred And chairing a cabinet meeting after his resignation speech An MP who said he had ""no choice"" but to resign yesterday -  after ""inaccurate briefings"" about the Chris Pincher affair - is back in the education department a day later. Rewinding back to Monday, Colchester MPWill Quince defended Boris Johnson, saying the PM ""was not aware"" of allegations made against Pincher. It was a line that unravelled, prompting Quince's departure. Tonight Quince is ona list of new appointments,working for the same prime minister.  Veteran Conservative Lord Michael Heseltine says Boris Johnson should leave office straight away. The former deputy prime minister says there is a ""lack of trust"" in Johnson. ""Leaving him in a position where he can use the power of the premiership to suit his own causes and his own interests is a very dangerous thing to doâ, he tells the BBC. ""It will merely perpetuate the uncertainty,"" he adds. The Conservative veteran says rules should be adopted to speed up the process of choosing a new prime minister  and Johnsonâs deputy, Dominic Raab, should be put in place in the meantime. It comes after, as we reported earlier, former Prime Minister Sir John Major said it was""unwise"" for Boris Johnson to remain in officewhile his successor is chosen.

Critics of the PM accused him being ""economical with the truth"", while supporters said it was a ""real shame"" to see him leave office. Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice says recent polling indicates the events of the last 48 hours have negatively impacted the public's willingness to vote for the Conservative Party. He tells the BBC that one poll taken on Thursday after the raft of ministerial resignations put Tory support at 31%, which Curtice says is ""as bad as it was at the height of the Partygate scandal"". However, the University of Strathclyde academic cautions it is still ""early days"" to know what the public think. But it's certainly, on that first indication, not done [Tory polling] any good and underlines the potential problem that faces whoever becomes the next Conservative leader.""

News of Boris Johnson's resignation is big news globally, and BBC correspondents have been gathering reactions where they are. Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter: To many Democrats like President Joe Biden, Johnson and Donald Trump are political peas in a pod, with similar views on trade and immigration and similarly iconoclastic political instincts. By their logic, anything that is bad for Johnson bodes ill for Trump and his Republican allies. And anything that hurts Trump is good for the Democrats. Biden may want to take pause, however, as Johnson's undoing could have less in common with Trump's political disposition than with his own.""  Katya Adler, Europe editor: Few in mainland Europe will shed a tear when Johnson goes. Politicians blame him for blustering his way through Brexit. They accuse him of failing to be honest with the British people about its true implications. Wholesale rejection of Johnson's bill currently making its way through parliament, to unilaterally re-write the international post-Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland, has managed to unite the normally bickering EU institutions: the Commission, Parliament and Council.""  Karishma Vaswani, Asia presenter: This is big news in places like Australia, India, Malaysia and in Singapore - countries that have had historical links to the UK and inherited their parliamentary system as part of being previous colonies. More than one commentator has asked the question: what kind of signal is the UK sending about the state of democracy to the rest of the world, when even after a number of his colleagues have asked for him to step down - ostensibly for the good of the country - the leader initially refused to go?""  Pumza Filhlani, southern Africa reporter: For those keenly following British politics on the continent, a common thread is emerging from early reaction to news of Boris Johnson's resignation as party leader and prime minister in a few months' time: one of envy. Those who've taken to social media have lamented how uncommon it is in many African countries for a leader to step down from power or even for his party to force him to leave over a lack of performance.""  Read our correspondents' analysisherein full. Downing Street has just released a list of ministers it has appointed after the slew of resignations in the past few days: It's been an eventful day with Boris Johnson saying he will step down as prime minister. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here are the main developments from the past few hours: Adam ShawReporting from Uxbridge Maqsud Gillani was one Uxbridge voter who voiced sympathy for his MP Voters in Boris Johnsonâs constituency ofUxbridge and South Ruisliphave largely backed his decision to resign as Conservative Party leader, as some argued it was time for him to step down as their MP too. Sheila Gibb, who says she's never supported Johnson, suggests he won't âbe able to show his faceâ in west London anymore. âHeâll be totally shamefaced, Iâm sure heâll resign as an MP. Thatâs what he should do as well, but heâs got no integrity."" Mark Lewis Fellow Uxbridge residentMark Lewis,who compares Johnson to âan ostrich burying his head in the sandâ, agrees his time as an MP could be up. âHe doesnât care about this area, he never has. The only reason he became an MP is so he could become prime minister. He just happened to pick here."" RodneyandDorothy Shuttlesay they are âpleasedâ to see Johnson quit, arguing his tenure was dotted with issues that had upset the public. Dorothy and Rodney Shuttle âItâs about time, heâs been caught out once too often. He should have stepped down a while back. Now itâs all about whoâs going to replace him because thereâs not much out there,"" Dorothy says. While most people say it was the right decision for Johnson to stand down, some Uxbridge locals have sympathy for the situation he found himself in. Maqsud Gillanisaid: âHe did OK for a long time and made some good calls. I think we did well during Covid and with the vaccine programme as that was very tough for him."" Another resident,Dolores, who did not want to give her surname, says Johnson ""did a good job"" as PM and that he will ""keep fighting for Uxbridge"". Joseph CassidyBBC Political Research Unit Following the wave of resignations over the last two days, there are 28 junior minister vacancies - but why does this matter? Junior ministers get a lot less attention than their cabinet bosses, but their work is vital to the normal functioning of government. What they do can vary from department to department, but put simply they often handle a lot of the less glamorous responsibilities - what one former minister described to the Institute for Government as""the routine stuff, the nuts and bolts"",external. This could include dealing with correspondence, replying to questions from MPs and making sure bills get passed through Parliament smoothly. For example, theOnline Safety Bill- which introduces wide-reaching reforms of how the internet is regulated - returns to Parliament next week, but the minister responsible for it, Chris Philp, has resigned and is yet to be replaced.

Audit finds council failings in land sale deals,"The report found ""significant failings"" in two land deals in which council chief David Jackson was involved An extraordinary audit of controversial land deals by Causeway Coast and Glens Council has found a ""culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land deals done"". Theaudit was ordered in November 2020. It came after it emerged the council granted a right of way in Portstewart to a hotel developer for Â£1 in March 2016. The council said it would consider the report and meet to discuss it in August. The report,externalfound the council ""failed to demonstrate"" that it obtained the best price for the ratepayer in the transacting of land sales and rights of way. Local government auditor Colette Kane said the behaviour of some council officers had ""fallen short of the standards expected in a public body"". Full Audit Office report into Causeway Coast and Glens Council,external The report also found council chief executive David Jackson was ""directly involved"" in two particular land deals in which ""a number of significant failings were evident"", including the Portstewart case. The review of this transaction found there was no professional valuation carried out prior to the granting of the right of way. The sale of land to a charity seeking to progress a hotel development at Castleroe Road, Coleraine, in 2015 for Â£5,000 also featured in the report. The report found, in both cases, there was a failure to demonstrate best price was obtained and that ""inadequate information"" was presented by senior council officers to councillors to enable them to make informed decisions. The local government auditor said, in her view, both land transactions were not ""properly authorised"" and that ""there is a case for finding they had not been granted lawfully"". The report said the extent of the detailed involvement of the chief executive in a number of cases was ""unusual"". The report found that a culture of ""bypassing best practice and guidance"" to get land deals done existed at the council ""I have identified evidence that adherence to legislation and best practice in land and property matters was not part of the culture of the council,"" said Ms Kane. ""There was evidence that senior officers were advocating actions that were contrary to best practice. ""This leads me to conclude that a culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land 'deals done' which set the wrong tone from the top of the organisation. ""In some cases legal advice was ignored and, on one occasion, inaccurate and unreliable information was provided to the local government auditor."" The report detailed how the right of way at Portstewart was granted to a hotel developer to allow site access for a proposed hotel development. Ms Kane said senior council officers' responses repeatedly referred to the economic benefit to the borough ""as justification for the decisions taken"". However, she added she ""did not consider that these responses sufficiently excuse the divergence from good practice and guidance"". The local government auditor found the behaviour of senior council officers was ""serious and concerning"" and recommended council should ""take appropriate action"" including referring them to the relevant professional bodies. On the finding that the conduct of some council officers had fallen ""well short of expected standards"", the report said ""there were indicators of wilful misconduct"" which were considered carefully. However, it concluded ""the threshold has not been adequately reached for any officer"". The local government auditor said the Portstewart case demonstrated ""little regard for getting the best price for the council and ratepayers"" and that the potential for marriage value/other special value to the purchaser ""does not appear to have been taken into account"". The report also highlighted a perceived conflict of interest relating to the council chief executive David Jackson in the Coleraine case. Ms Kane said the purchaser of the land nominated the chief executive for the Freedom of the City of London, which he was awarded in August 2016. This came after initial contact with him regarding the sale but before sealing the transaction. When asked whether this had been brought to councillors' attention prior to the acceptance of the award, the report said the council responded that ""although several members were present when the chief executive initially declined the award and deferred to elected members, subsequently the mayor and group leaders were verbally briefed"". Ms Kane said this example along with another perceived conflict of interest relating to the valuation process in the Coleraine sale ""could have, and should have, been avoided"". ""They served to further undermine the integrity of the transaction being negotiated and the wider integrity of public services, creating a lack of public trust,"" she added. In October 2020,BBC News NI reported the council's chief executive was ""ultimately responsible""for granting right of way over public land in Portstewart for Â£1. The North Antrim assembly member Jim Allister, who first brought the Â£1 land transaction to the attention of the Audit Office in 2017, said he welcomed the ""robust findings"". Jim Allister said the land deals showed a ""cavalier disregard for the ratepayers' interests"" Mr Allister became aware the council had granted the right of way for Â£1, whenhe successfully judicially reviewed the council's decision to grant planning permission for the hotel complexin Portstewart. He described the findings as ""truly shocking"" and ""well beyond the tolerance level where the chief executive and other senior officers can cling to office"". ""The Â£1 land deal to assemble a site for a hotel developer illustrates the cavalier disregard for the ratepayers' interests and the lamentable failure of oversight by compliant councillors. ""I welcome the auditor's belief that the disregard for legal process renders the granting of this easement unlawful. The council must now address this challenge."" The report makes a number of other recommendations which include: The Department of Communities ""should carry out a detailed consideration of its responsibilities... in light of the significant failings identified by this audit and take the required appropriate action and use its powers to intervene if necessary"" An independent review of the council's governance arrangements, overseen by the Department for Communities The provision of enhanced training to elected members, to facilitate their understanding of the level of challenge and scrutiny needed when holding council officers to account A spokesperson for the council said: ""Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council acknowledges the publication of the extraordinary audit report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Time will be required to fully assess the content and recommendations, and for council to consider the next steps. ""Work on this report began in late 2020, and throughout that time council cooperated fully with the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Council has already made changes to its land and property procedures and intends to comply with its obligations to ratepayers and stakeholders. ""The council will meet to discuss the report, its recommendations and further action to be taken, at the next full council meeting on Tuesday 2 August 2022."" In a statement, the DUP said the conduct of some senior council officers ""fell well short"" of the standards expected and that public confidence ""has been eroded"". Sinn FÃ©in councillor Leanne Peacock said the findings were ""deeply shocking and disgraceful"" and urged action for the report's recommendations to be implemented. The SDLP's Margaret Anne McKillop said there had been a ""lack of accountability"" at the council while the UUP said the council must ensure ""recommendations made are dealt with in an appropriate way"". Independent councillor Angela Mulholland said a ""special council meeting should be called sooner rather than later to deal with the findings"".

Stranded motorway kitten makes good recovery,"Anna Leather, who is caring for Smudge, says the kitten has recovered from the motorway rescue A kitten which was rescued from the central reservation of a motorway is said to have made a good recovery from its ordeal. The four-week-old black feline, now called Smudge, was spotted between junctions six and seven on the M18 northbound near Doncaster on Saturday. Motorway traffic was brought to a standstill while a National Highways officer rescued the young cat. Anna Leather, who is caring for her, says she improved after a ""good bath"". It is thought Smudge had been dumped by the side of the motorway and narrowly escaped being run over as traffic thundered past. Traffic officer Gavin Buffam, who rescued the cat, said: ""The first time I tried to scoop her up she decided she didn't like me and wanted to take my finger off. ""I got a good hiss and nearly a good scratch, so I thought I'd leave her be and retreated back to the hard shoulder."" Concerned drivers on the M18 called emergency services after driving past the stranded kitten Colleague Andy Binns, who put a rolling road block in place to allow a second rescue attempt, said: ""If it's living and breathing we deal with everything the same, whether it's ducklings, badgers, foxes, we treat every animal the same - life is precious."" Ms Leather said: ""She looked absolutely awful, full of muck and the parts of debris in her coat were like sandpaper and greasy. ""We gave her a good bath, a good feed and now she can't stop feeding, she's like a pot-bellied pig."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Here's a round-up of what happened:  Today's coverage was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Emily McGarvey, Marita Maloney, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Aoife Walsh, Adam Durbin and Catherine Evans. As you're probably aware by now, Boris Johnson has resigned as Conservative leader and will step down as prime minister when a replacement is found. But how does that happen? In theory the prime minister could resign immediately and a caretaker could take over - but while there are calls for this from Tory MPs, opposition parties and Conservative Party grandees like former PM John Major - there is currently no indication this will happen. He could also be ousted by a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but this would rely on Tory MPs supporting an opposition motion and voting against their own government - an unlikely scenario. So the most probable course of events to find a new PM is an internal leadership election replaces Johnson as the top Tory. It's been suggested that process could last until October, although it could be much shorter with the replacement of Theresa May as leader only taking two months. Conservative Party leadership votes are split into two sections. In the first phase MPs whittle down a list of colleagues who put their names forward in a series of votes until two final candidates remain. These two final MPs are then put to the party membership to pick who will be the next leader. Read our analysis of how the next few weeks and months could play out - as well as the ins and outs of internal Tory politics -here. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Is the European Union rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's
downfall? Yes but also no. When asked by journalists on Thursday if any extra bottles of champagne
had been ordered in response to news of his resignation, an EU spokesman drily
responded: ""We have a very limited consumption of alcoholic beverages in
the (European) Commission."" This, a presumed dig at Johnson, who recently admitted there was ""a
problem with alcohol"" in UK political circles. He was also accused of tolerating and attending boozy gatherings at
Downing Street during the strict Covid lockdown. All over the European press, Johnson is not beloved in the EU. 'Borexit' screamed Germany's biggest tabloid, Bild on Thursday. It also
chose to write an English headline: ""Bye Bye Boris"". But most EU diplomats I've been chatting to regard the
mass resignations of Conservative ministers around Boris Johnson as
self-serving attempts to save their career rather than signs of disagreement
with his policies, Brexit-related or otherwise. ""This Johnson resignation just means more uncertainty
for us Europeans. More UK inward-looking obsession with its own domestic
dramas, rather than looking outwards towards partners abroad,"" grumbled
one particularly fed-up EU diplomat. Read more We've put together a compilation of the picturescapturing the rise and fall of Boris Johnson- from his days as an Eton schoolboy, his time as London mayor, to the events of his two and a half years as Prime Minister. Here are five iconic shots of his career: Celebrating his successful campaign to be London mayor in 2008 with future PM David Cameron Johnson famously got stuck on a zipwire waving two Union flags during celebrations of the London 2012 Olympics He was a figurehead for the successful Leave campaign during 2016 EU referendum, when he and Michael Gove campaigned for the UK to end its membership Johnson's winning 2019 general election campaign was centred around his pledge to ""get Brexit done"". He was confronted early on in his premiership by the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to his calling the first lockdown in March 2020 He's announced he's standing to be the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. But what do we know about Tom Tugendhat? Here are a few facts about the Tonbridge and Malling MP.  Boris Johnsonhas stood down as Conservative leader, but will continue to serve as PM until the party chooses his successor. When is the next general election due? UK general elections - where all 650 MPs are elected to the House of Commons - have to be held no more than five years apart. Unless an earlier one is called, the next election isn't due until January 2025. Would a new PM need to hold an early election? Now that Johnson has resigned, the Conservative Party will need to choose a new leader. The winner of that contest will become the next PM. The new PM would not be obliged to call an early election - but could do so if they wished. When Gordon Brown took over from Labour prime minister Tony Blair in 2007, for example, he did not hold an early election. How is an early election called? If a PM wants an early election they need to make a ""request"" to the Queen to dissolve Parliament - the official term for closing Parliament in order to hold an election. Read more about the process here Chair
of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat has launched his bid to
become the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. In
an article in the Telegraph newspaper, he says he would bring a ""clean
start"". He writes that he wants to build a ""broad coalition of
colleagues"" to ""bring new energy and ideas to government"" and
""bridge the Brexit divide"". Setting
out his stall, he writes that ""taxes, bluntly, are too high.""
Specifically: ""We should immediately reverse the recent National Insurance
hike and let hard-working people, and employers, keep more of their money. Fuel
tax must come down. And un-conservative tariffs, that push up prices for
consumers, should be dropped."" He
talks about the cost of living as an ""national security issue"" and
says there should be more police on the streets to tackle crime. Kim Pringle believes the current political situation is ""ridiculous"" We've been hearing from people around the country in the wake of Boris Johnson's resignation announcement. InCheltenham, where MP Alex Chalk resigned as solicitor general yesterday, voters have been sharing their views on a seismic day for UK politics. Kim Pringlesays she is ""disgusted"" with politics in Britain, the government and the cabinet. ""They have no
scruples, they have no morals and they have no integrity. And the lies, that
have come since Boris went on his campaign. Itâs just astounding,"" she says. Nichola Vaughan says the government doesn't fully take account of voters' intentions Nichola Vaughan, a self-confessed ""floating voter"", says ""everybody needs to take a deep breath"". She adds: ""I think that people in government need to realise that a lot of people in this county are not London centric, not government centric. We base our views and our votes on the people in our local area...sometimes Iâm Lib Dem, sometimes Iâm Conservative.â  Daksha Mistry says someone needs to take over who can ""command respect"" Also reacting from Cheltenham isDaksha Mistry, who says the country needs a leader with ""credibility"" who can garner respect. âWe were avid supporters of the Conservatives, and heâs [Johnson] pretty much just embarrassed us lately,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, one Tory MP - who quit dramatically from a government post yesterday - told me ministerial posts could prove a challenge to fill. But, they added, some might accept positions if only to ""put the country first"" and keep government functioning. Certainly a few of tonight's appointments have turned heads. Will Quince has returned as an education minister. Remember he quit after being wheeled out to defend Downing Street's handling of the Chris Pincher sexual misconduct allegations - later saying he was ""given assurances"" the prime minister had no knowledge of former allegations against Mr Pincher, which turned out to be incorrect. Johnny Mercer's appointment as a veterans minister has also caused chatter in Westminster circles. In April last year he resigned from this post - saying he was ""forced"" to over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. He gave a series of hostile interviews at the time - saying the government had ""abandoned people"" in a way he couldn't reconcile. Clearly he's been able to reconcile that now.

Downing Street has just released a list of ministers it has appointed after the slew of resignations in the past few days: It's been an eventful day with Boris Johnson saying he will step down as prime minister. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here are the main developments from the past few hours: Adam ShawReporting from Uxbridge Maqsud Gillani was one Uxbridge voter who voiced sympathy for his MP Voters in Boris Johnsonâs constituency ofUxbridge and South Ruisliphave largely backed his decision to resign as Conservative Party leader, as some argued it was time for him to step down as their MP too. Sheila Gibb, who says she's never supported Johnson, suggests he won't âbe able to show his faceâ in west London anymore. âHeâll be totally shamefaced, Iâm sure heâll resign as an MP. Thatâs what he should do as well, but heâs got no integrity."" Mark Lewis Fellow Uxbridge residentMark Lewis,who compares Johnson to âan ostrich burying his head in the sandâ, agrees his time as an MP could be up. âHe doesnât care about this area, he never has. The only reason he became an MP is so he could become prime minister. He just happened to pick here."" RodneyandDorothy Shuttlesay they are âpleasedâ to see Johnson quit, arguing his tenure was dotted with issues that had upset the public. Dorothy and Rodney Shuttle âItâs about time, heâs been caught out once too often. He should have stepped down a while back. Now itâs all about whoâs going to replace him because thereâs not much out there,"" Dorothy says. While most people say it was the right decision for Johnson to stand down, some Uxbridge locals have sympathy for the situation he found himself in. Maqsud Gillanisaid: âHe did OK for a long time and made some good calls. I think we did well during Covid and with the vaccine programme as that was very tough for him."" Another resident,Dolores, who did not want to give her surname, says Johnson ""did a good job"" as PM and that he will ""keep fighting for Uxbridge"". Joseph CassidyBBC Political Research Unit Following the wave of resignations over the last two days, there are 28 junior minister vacancies - but why does this matter? Junior ministers get a lot less attention than their cabinet bosses, but their work is vital to the normal functioning of government. What they do can vary from department to department, but put simply they often handle a lot of the less glamorous responsibilities - what one former minister described to the Institute for Government as""the routine stuff, the nuts and bolts"",external. This could include dealing with correspondence, replying to questions from MPs and making sure bills get passed through Parliament smoothly. For example, theOnline Safety Bill- which introduces wide-reaching reforms of how the internet is regulated - returns to Parliament next week, but the minister responsible for it, Chris Philp, has resigned and is yet to be replaced.

Bank of England vows to bring down inflationThe bank's chief economist says its focus is getting prices down and making life affordable again.Business,"The Bank of England has hinted at further interest rate rises as it vows to bring inflation back down to 2%. The central bank's focus was getting prices down and making life more affordable again, its chief economist Huw Pill said in a speech on Wednesday. In May, UK inflation hit9.1%, its highest level in 40 years.And interest rates are at a13-year record high of 1.25%. Mr Pill said he was open to voting for an interest rate rise above 0.25%. This is the same figure the Bank of England decided on for the last five interest rate increases in a row. Mr Pill said his statement showed he was willing to adopt a faster pace of tightening but also emphasised that it was dependent on what the economic data showed. He stressed that ""much remains to be resolved before we vote on our August policy decision"". ""How I vote on that occasion will be determined by the data that we see and my interpretation of it,"" he said. Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor at the bank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would act ""forcefully"" to make sure higher inflation does not become ""the new normal"". What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 one year and Â£1.09 the next year, then that's an annual inflation rate of 9%. The UK's rate of inflation is being driven up as the prices of fuel, energy and food soar in part due to the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. In June, the Bank of England warned inflation could reach 11% One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow less and spend less. Higher interest rates also motivate people to save more. The Bank of England chief economist's warning of ""difficult times for many people"" is meant to reiterate the commitment the Bank has to get inflation down in the coming months. Huw Pill's speech seems to back up forecasts in the City that the Bank will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next month. While we have heard repeatedly that the Bank and the government seek to avoid the emergence of a self-fulfilling spiral of rising prices and wages, perhaps the most interesting part of the speech concerned companies.

LiveLivePM clings to job as cabinet pressure ramps up4 minutes ago4 minutes ago What's the latest?What's the latest?25 minutes ago Welcome to our live coverageWelcome to our live coverageLive PM clings to job as cabinet pressure ramps up  4 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has quit as Conservative leader, saying it is ""clearly now the will"" of Tory MPs that there should be a new leader He pledges to stay on as PM until a successor is chosen - but a growing number of Tory MPs say he has to leave No 10 now Johnson assured cabinet this afternoon he would only act as a caretaker PM while remaining in position, new Welsh Secretary Robert Buckland says But ex-PM Sir John Major says Johnson should go now for the good of the country Labour also says Johnson must leave office, saying they could try to bring a no confidence vote in Parliament Downing Street announces 12 new ministers, filling some of the posts left vacant by the recent wave of resignations Foreign Secretary Liz Truss - a possible leadership contender who has remained silent for days - says her party needs to keep governing until a new leader is found Edited by Nathan Williams We're pausing our live coverage shortly, after a rather eventful day. Here's a round-up of what happened:  Today's coverage was brought to you by: Nathan Williams, Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Emily McGarvey, Marita Maloney, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Aoife Walsh, Adam Durbin and Catherine Evans. As you're probably aware by now, Boris Johnson has resigned as Conservative leader and will step down as prime minister when a replacement is found. But how does that happen? In theory the prime minister could resign immediately and a caretaker could take over - but while there are calls for this from Tory MPs, opposition parties and Conservative Party grandees like former PM John Major - there is currently no indication this will happen. He could also be ousted by a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but this would rely on Tory MPs supporting an opposition motion and voting against their own government - an unlikely scenario. So the most probable course of events to find a new PM is an internal leadership election replaces Johnson as the top Tory. It's been suggested that process could last until October, although it could be much shorter with the replacement of Theresa May as leader only taking two months. Conservative Party leadership votes are split into two sections. In the first phase MPs whittle down a list of colleagues who put their names forward in a series of votes until two final candidates remain. These two final MPs are then put to the party membership to pick who will be the next leader. Read our analysis of how the next few weeks and months could play out - as well as the ins and outs of internal Tory politics -here. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Is the European Union rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's
downfall? Yes but also no. When asked by journalists on Thursday if any extra bottles of champagne
had been ordered in response to news of his resignation, an EU spokesman drily
responded: ""We have a very limited consumption of alcoholic beverages in
the (European) Commission."" This, a presumed dig at Johnson, who recently admitted there was ""a
problem with alcohol"" in UK political circles. He was also accused of tolerating and attending boozy gatherings at
Downing Street during the strict Covid lockdown. All over the European press, Johnson is not beloved in the EU. 'Borexit' screamed Germany's biggest tabloid, Bild on Thursday. It also
chose to write an English headline: ""Bye Bye Boris"". But most EU diplomats I've been chatting to regard the
mass resignations of Conservative ministers around Boris Johnson as
self-serving attempts to save their career rather than signs of disagreement
with his policies, Brexit-related or otherwise. ""This Johnson resignation just means more uncertainty
for us Europeans. More UK inward-looking obsession with its own domestic
dramas, rather than looking outwards towards partners abroad,"" grumbled
one particularly fed-up EU diplomat. Read more We've put together a compilation of the picturescapturing the rise and fall of Boris Johnson- from his days as an Eton schoolboy, his time as London mayor, to the events of his two and a half years as Prime Minister. Here are five iconic shots of his career: Celebrating his successful campaign to be London mayor in 2008 with future PM David Cameron Johnson famously got stuck on a zipwire waving two Union flags during celebrations of the London 2012 Olympics He was a figurehead for the successful Leave campaign during 2016 EU referendum, when he and Michael Gove campaigned for the UK to end its membership Johnson's winning 2019 general election campaign was centred around his pledge to ""get Brexit done"". He was confronted early on in his premiership by the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to his calling the first lockdown in March 2020 He's announced he's standing to be the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. But what do we know about Tom Tugendhat? Here are a few facts about the Tonbridge and Malling MP.  Boris Johnsonhas stood down as Conservative leader, but will continue to serve as PM until the party chooses his successor. When is the next general election due? UK general elections - where all 650 MPs are elected to the House of Commons - have to be held no more than five years apart. Unless an earlier one is called, the next election isn't due until January 2025. Would a new PM need to hold an early election? Now that Johnson has resigned, the Conservative Party will need to choose a new leader. The winner of that contest will become the next PM. The new PM would not be obliged to call an early election - but could do so if they wished. When Gordon Brown took over from Labour prime minister Tony Blair in 2007, for example, he did not hold an early election. How is an early election called? If a PM wants an early election they need to make a ""request"" to the Queen to dissolve Parliament - the official term for closing Parliament in order to hold an election. Read more about the process here Chair
of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat has launched his bid to
become the next leader of the Conservative Party - and prime minister. In
an article in the Telegraph newspaper, he says he would bring a ""clean
start"". He writes that he wants to build a ""broad coalition of
colleagues"" to ""bring new energy and ideas to government"" and
""bridge the Brexit divide"". Setting
out his stall, he writes that ""taxes, bluntly, are too high.""
Specifically: ""We should immediately reverse the recent National Insurance
hike and let hard-working people, and employers, keep more of their money. Fuel
tax must come down. And un-conservative tariffs, that push up prices for
consumers, should be dropped."" He
talks about the cost of living as an ""national security issue"" and
says there should be more police on the streets to tackle crime. Kim Pringle believes the current political situation is ""ridiculous"" We've been hearing from people around the country in the wake of Boris Johnson's resignation announcement. InCheltenham, where MP Alex Chalk resigned as solicitor general yesterday, voters have been sharing their views on a seismic day for UK politics. Kim Pringlesays she is ""disgusted"" with politics in Britain, the government and the cabinet. ""They have no
scruples, they have no morals and they have no integrity. And the lies, that
have come since Boris went on his campaign. Itâs just astounding,"" she says. Nichola Vaughan says the government doesn't fully take account of voters' intentions Nichola Vaughan, a self-confessed ""floating voter"", says ""everybody needs to take a deep breath"". She adds: ""I think that people in government need to realise that a lot of people in this county are not London centric, not government centric. We base our views and our votes on the people in our local area...sometimes Iâm Lib Dem, sometimes Iâm Conservative.â  Daksha Mistry says someone needs to take over who can ""command respect"" Also reacting from Cheltenham isDaksha Mistry, who says the country needs a leader with ""credibility"" who can garner respect. âWe were avid supporters of the Conservatives, and heâs [Johnson] pretty much just embarrassed us lately,"" she says. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, one Tory MP - who quit dramatically from a government post yesterday - told me ministerial posts could prove a challenge to fill. But, they added, some might accept positions if only to ""put the country first"" and keep government functioning. Certainly a few of tonight's appointments have turned heads. Will Quince has returned as an education minister. Remember he quit after being wheeled out to defend Downing Street's handling of the Chris Pincher sexual misconduct allegations - later saying he was ""given assurances"" the prime minister had no knowledge of former allegations against Mr Pincher, which turned out to be incorrect. Johnny Mercer's appointment as a veterans minister has also caused chatter in Westminster circles. In April last year he resigned from this post - saying he was ""forced"" to over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. He gave a series of hostile interviews at the time - saying the government had ""abandoned people"" in a way he couldn't reconcile. Clearly he's been able to reconcile that now.

These new pictures released by No 10 give us an insight into the moments after the prime minister resigned. Prime Minister Boris Johnson walks back through the No 10 door after delivering his statement Here he is hugging his wife Carrie and their children With his son Wilfred And chairing a cabinet meeting after his resignation speech An MP who said he had ""no choice"" but to resign yesterday -  after ""inaccurate briefings"" about the Chris Pincher affair - is back in the education department a day later. Rewinding back to Monday, Colchester MPWill Quince defended Boris Johnson, saying the PM ""was not aware"" of allegations made against Pincher. It was a line that unravelled, prompting Quince's departure. Tonight Quince is ona list of new appointments,working for the same prime minister.  Veteran Conservative Lord Michael Heseltine says Boris Johnson should leave office straight away. The former deputy prime minister says there is a ""lack of trust"" in Johnson. ""Leaving him in a position where he can use the power of the premiership to suit his own causes and his own interests is a very dangerous thing to doâ, he tells the BBC. ""It will merely perpetuate the uncertainty,"" he adds. The Conservative veteran says rules should be adopted to speed up the process of choosing a new prime minister  and Johnsonâs deputy, Dominic Raab, should be put in place in the meantime. It comes after, as we reported earlier, former Prime Minister Sir John Major said it was""unwise"" for Boris Johnson to remain in officewhile his successor is chosen. This video can not be played Boris Johnson resigns as Tory leader: Voters from across England react to the news We've been speaking to voters to gather their views on the frantic events of the last few days. Critics of the PM accused him being ""economical with the truth"", while supporters said it was a ""real shame"" to see him leave office. Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice says recent polling indicates the events of the last 48 hours have negatively impacted the public's willingness to vote for the Conservative Party. He tells the BBC that one poll taken on Thursday after the raft of ministerial resignations put Tory support at 31%, which Curtice says is ""as bad as it was at the height of the Partygate scandal"". However, the University of Strathclyde academic cautions it is still ""early days"" to know what the public think. But it's certainly, on that first indication, not done [Tory polling] any good and underlines the potential problem that faces whoever becomes the next Conservative leader.""  For those who can't get enough of robust debate, BBC Question Time will be live tonight from Barnsley. The panellists looking at the twists and turns of the last few days in Westminster will be: You can watch the showlive on iPlayerfrom 20:00 BST and at 22:55 on BBC One . News of Boris Johnson's resignation is big news globally, and BBC correspondents have been gathering reactions where they are. Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter: To many Democrats like President Joe Biden, Johnson and Donald Trump are political peas in a pod, with similar views on trade and immigration and similarly iconoclastic political instincts. By their logic, anything that is bad for Johnson bodes ill for Trump and his Republican allies. And anything that hurts Trump is good for the Democrats. Biden may want to take pause, however, as Johnson's undoing could have less in common with Trump's political disposition than with his own.""  Katya Adler, Europe editor: Few in mainland Europe will shed a tear when Johnson goes. Politicians blame him for blustering his way through Brexit. They accuse him of failing to be honest with the British people about its true implications. Wholesale rejection of Johnson's bill currently making its way through parliament, to unilaterally re-write the international post-Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland, has managed to unite the normally bickering EU institutions: the Commission, Parliament and Council.""  Karishma Vaswani, Asia presenter: This is big news in places like Australia, India, Malaysia and in Singapore - countries that have had historical links to the UK and inherited their parliamentary system as part of being previous colonies. More than one commentator has asked the question: what kind of signal is the UK sending about the state of democracy to the rest of the world, when even after a number of his colleagues have asked for him to step down - ostensibly for the good of the country - the leader initially refused to go?""  Pumza Filhlani, southern Africa reporter: For those keenly following British politics on the continent, a common thread is emerging from early reaction to news of Boris Johnson's resignation as party leader and prime minister in a few months' time: one of envy. Those who've taken to social media have lamented how uncommon it is in many African countries for a leader to step down from power or even for his party to force him to leave over a lack of performance.""  Read our correspondents' analysisherein full. Downing Street has just released a list of ministers it has appointed after the slew of resignations in the past few days: It's been an eventful day with Boris Johnson saying he will step down as prime minister. If you're just joining us or need a recap, here are the main developments from the past few hours: Adam ShawReporting from Uxbridge Maqsud Gillani was one Uxbridge voter who voiced sympathy for his MP Voters in Boris Johnsonâs constituency ofUxbridge and South Ruisliphave largely backed his decision to resign as Conservative Party leader, as some argued it was time for him to step down as their MP too. Sheila Gibb, who says she's never supported Johnson, suggests he won't âbe able to show his faceâ in west London anymore. âHeâll be totally shamefaced, Iâm sure heâll resign as an MP. Thatâs what he should do as well, but heâs got no integrity."" Mark Lewis Fellow Uxbridge residentMark Lewis,who compares Johnson to âan ostrich burying his head in the sandâ, agrees his time as an MP could be up. âHe doesnât care about this area, he never has. The only reason he became an MP is so he could become prime minister. He just happened to pick here."" RodneyandDorothy Shuttlesay they are âpleasedâ to see Johnson quit, arguing his tenure was dotted with issues that had upset the public. Dorothy and Rodney Shuttle âItâs about time, heâs been caught out once too often. He should have stepped down a while back. Now itâs all about whoâs going to replace him because thereâs not much out there,"" Dorothy says. While most people say it was the right decision for Johnson to stand down, some Uxbridge locals have sympathy for the situation he found himself in. Maqsud Gillanisaid: âHe did OK for a long time and made some good calls. I think we did well during Covid and with the vaccine programme as that was very tough for him."" Another resident,Dolores, who did not want to give her surname, says Johnson ""did a good job"" as PM and that he will ""keep fighting for Uxbridge"". Joseph CassidyBBC Political Research Unit Following the wave of resignations over the last two days, there are 28 junior minister vacancies - but why does this matter? Junior ministers get a lot less attention than their cabinet bosses, but their work is vital to the normal functioning of government. What they do can vary from department to department, but put simply they often handle a lot of the less glamorous responsibilities - what one former minister described to the Institute for Government as""the routine stuff, the nuts and bolts"",external. This could include dealing with correspondence, replying to questions from MPs and making sure bills get passed through Parliament smoothly. For example, theOnline Safety Bill- which introduces wide-reaching reforms of how the internet is regulated - returns to Parliament next week, but the minister responsible for it, Chris Philp, has resigned and is yet to be replaced.

MI5 and FBI heads warn of âimmenseâ threat from ChinaThe UK and US security service heads make an unprecedented joint appearance to warn about China.,"MI5 head Ken McCallum (left) and FBI director Christopher Wray (right) made an unprecedented joint appearance in London The heads of UK and US security services have made an unprecedented joint appearance to warn of the threat from China. FBI director Christopher Wray said China was the ""biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security"" and had interfered in politics, including recent elections. MI5 head Ken McCallum said his service had more than doubled its work against Chinese activity in the last three years and would be doubling it again. MI5 is now running seven times as many investigations related to activities of the Chinese Communist Party compared to 2018, he added. The FBI's Wray warned that if China was to forcibly take Taiwan it would ""represent one of the most horrific business disruptions the world has ever seen"". In response, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said British intelligence was trying to ""hype up the China threat theory"" and he advised the head of MI5 to ""cast away imagined demons"". He said the FBI director had also been ""playing up the China threat to smear and attack China"" revealing a ""Cold War mentality"" and urged him to stop making ""irresponsible"" remarks. The first ever joint public appearance by the two directors came at MI5 headquarters in Thames House, London. McCallum also said the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party was ""game-changing"", while Wray called it ""immense"" and ""breath-taking"". Wray warned the audience - which included chief executives of businesses and senior figures from universities - that the Chinese government was ""set on stealing your technology"" using a range of tools. He said it posed ""an even more serious threat to western businesses than even many sophisticated businesspeople realised"". He cited cases in which people linked to Chinese companies out in rural America had been digging up genetically modified seeds which would have cost them billions of dollars and nearly a decade to develop themselves. He also said China deployed cyber espionage to ""cheat and steal on a massive scale"", with a hacking programme larger than that of every other major country combined. The MI5 head said intelligence about cyber threats had been shared with 37 countries and that in May a sophisticated threat against aerospace had been disrupted. Both men warned that China was drawing lessons from the Russian invasion of Ukraine McCallum also pointed to a series of examples linked to China. These included a British aviation expert who had received an approach online and had been offered an attractive employment opportunity. He travelled to China twice to be ""wined and dined"" before being asked for technical information on military aircraft by a company which was actually a front for Chinese intelligence officers. ""That's where we stepped in,"" said McCallum. He also said one engineering firm had been approached by a Chinese company which led to its technology being taken before the deal was then called off, forcing the company, Smith's Harlow, to go into administration in 2020. And he pointed to the interference alert issued by Parliament in January about the activities of Christine Lee. He said these types of operations aimed to amplify pro-Chinese communist party voices and silence those that questioned its authority. ""It needs to be challenged,"" the MI5 head said. In the US, the FBI director said the Chinese government had directly interfered in a congressional election in New York this spring because they did not want a candidate who was a critic and former protester at Tiananmen Square to be elected. They had done so, he said, by hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory information. When they could not find anything, he said there had been an effort to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker before even suggesting staging a car accident. Wray said China was drawing ""all sorts of lessons"" from the conflict in Ukraine. This included trying to insulate themselves from any future sanctions of the type that have hit Russia. If China did invade Taiwan, the economic disruption would be much greater than that seen this year, he said, with western investments in China becoming ""hostages"" and supply chains disrupted. ""I don't have any reason to think their interest in Taiwan has abated in any fashion,"" the FBI director told journalists after the speech. The MI5 head said new legislation would help to deal with the threat but the UK also needed to become a ""harder target"" by ensuring that all parts of society were more aware of the risks. He said that reform of the visa system had seen over 50 students linked to the Chinese military leaving the UK. ""China has for far too long counted on being everybody's second-highest priority,"" Wray said, adding: ""They are not flying under the radar anymore.""

In his resignation letter, Mr Hart said colleagues had done their utmost to ""turn the ship around"" but he no longer thought that was possible. Mr Johnson has defied calls to resign, as he tries to face down a growing mutiny among his cabinet. In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and handed to the chief whip, Mr Hart insisted he had ""desperately hoped"" not to have to write it but saw ""no other option"". Government resignations: Who has gone, who is staying? Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full He said Mr Johnson would be remembered as a prime minister ""with energy, vision, determination and humour"". ""There was never a dull moment in your government and I will be forever grateful to have been given the chance to be part of it,"" he said. In his letter, he also said he had ""never been a massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best way of forcing change"". Mr Hart is the third cabinet minister to step down afterChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quit within minutes of one anotheron Tuesday. As of Wednesday night, 16 ministers had resigned, along with 20 government aides and five others. Levelling Up Secretary and former leadership rival to Mr Johnson, Michael Gove, wassacked by the prime ministerafter being part of the group of senior Tories urging him to go. Home Secretary Priti Patel, a former close ally, has also joined the group of rebel ministers. Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, called on the prime minister to ""reflect on his position and allow someone else to take on that mantle to deliver the Conservative manifesto"". It follows Mr Johnson's decision to appoint Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip earlier this year,despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him.

Mr Crabb, who confirmed he voted against Mr Johnson in the confidence vote last month, wrote in anarticle for the Pembrokeshire Herald,external: ""Every day I open my email inbox, every Q&A session I hold in the constituency, every time I visit Tesco or Morrisons in Haverfordwest, the feedback I receive is consistent and overwhelming: Boris Johnson should resign.""

Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams and Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies have both quit. Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones, aParliamentary Private Secretary,external(PPS) to theLeader of the House of Commons,externalsaid she would step down on Thursday if Mr Johnson was still in office after he had overseen an ""erosion of trust and decency at the heart of government"".

Government aide quits and calls for PM to resign,"A Conservative Welsh MP has quit her job as a government aide and called for Boris Johnson to step down as prime minister. Ynys MÃ´n MP Virginia Crosbie quit asParliamentary Private Secretary,external(PPS) at the Wales Office, saying Johnson's position had become ""untenable"". Her comments came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quit the cabinet. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said ""it's business as usual"" in the Wales Office. Mr Hart, who faced Welsh Questions in the Commons later, has yet to comment directly on Mr Johnson's leadership following the resignations of Mr Sunak and Mr Javid, both of him said theyno longer had confidence in Mr Johnson. In her resignation letter to Mr Johnson, Ms Crosbie said his ""inaccurate and contradictory"" statements over what he knew about Chris Pincher were the final straw. Virginia Crosbie won the Ynys MÃ´n (Anglesey) seat at the 2019 general election She added it was her belief the country had decided Mr Johnson ""cannot be trusted to tell the truth"". ""This can never be a position to inhabit for anyone in public life, let alone a prime minister,"" she added. Ms Crosbie is the first Welsh Tory MP to publicly call for Boris Johnson's resignation. She said she had given the prime minister the ""benefit of the doubt on many occasions"", but believed ""the situation is becoming worse"".

Earlier, in Welsh questions, Simon Hart was told by the Plaid Cymru MP that ""two cabinet ministers have gone, his PPS [Parliamentary Private Secretary] has gone, it isn't business as usual, is it? When will he [Mr Hart] be going?"" Mr Hart insisted it was ""business as usual in the Wales Office"" and he was ""proud to repeat"" that ""we are getting on with the Levelling Up Fund, the Community Renewal Fund and the Shared Prosperity Fund - investment across every part of Wales"". The Welsh secretary urged her to ""come and join us in the endeavour to improve the lives of people in Wales, rather than using rather cheap political opportunities to do the opposite"". Liz Saville Roberts said the prime minister was the ""best recruiting sergeant for independence"" Mr Johnson was hit byfurther resignations, as he prepared for PMQs. Nadhim Zahawi, who has replaced Mr Sunak as chancellor, urged his colleagues to unite and said Mr Johnson was focused on delivery. Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has said Mr Johnson must ""prove he can deliver on his mandate"" if he is to stay in post. Mr Davies said it was ""disappointing"" the government had ""struggled to deliver"" its agenda recently, and that ""the prime minister must now prove that he can deliver on his [election] mandate"". Mr Javid's and Mr Sunak's resignations came minutes after Mr Johnson sought to draw a line under a row about Mr Pincher, who is facing sexual misconduct allegations. The MP for Tamworth was suspended as a Conservative MP last week over allegations he groped two men at a private members' club in London. He said he wasseeking professional medical supportand had no intention of resigning as an MP. Andrew RT Davies says Mr Johnson needs the UK, his party and Parliament behind him Mr Davies said: ""I've always said it was essential for the prime minister to hold the confidence of our country, party and parliament."" A No 10 source said the new chancellor was ""more dynamic and more aligned"" with Mr Johnson, and described the new health secretary as a ""massive upgrade"". Mr Johnson apologised, on Tuesday evening, for appointing Mr Pincher to a government role after being told about a misconduct complaint against the MP. The prime minister admitted he had been told about the complaint in 2019 - but had made a ""bad mistake"" by not acting on it. Mr Sunak and Mr Javid resigned minutes after the prime minister spoke. This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it But ex-Monmouthshire Conservative council leader Richard John said the prime minister ""really needs to go"". ""Boris has defeated Corbyn, delivered the Covid vaccines and shown global leadership on Ukraine, but in politics honesty and integrity are critical,"" he said. He knowingly appointed, trivialised and defended Mr Pincher, Mr John said. Mr John, who was ousted as council leader in May's local elections, has previously called for the prime minister to quit. Labour Rhondda MP and chairman of the Commons' Committee on Standards and Privileges Chris Bryant, said he was ""looking forward to seeing"" the prime minister ""in the liaison committee tomorrow"". Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak resigned minutes after Boris Johnson's apology Mr Bryant said there were ""massive challenges in the country at the moment with the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine"". ""You need a leader with moral authority and Boris Johnson has none,"" he said. ""I'm delighted that Javid and Sunak have finally discovered this but they're complicit in this - because they've defended him up to the hilt all the way until today."" Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, Jo Stevens, said people should ask why Sunak and Javid had backed the prime minister for so long. Simon Hart said it was ""business as usual"" in the Wales Office She said: ""They knew he was dishonest. ""They knew he lied to and mocked the public's sacrifices during the pandemic, and they were complicit in all the sleaze, scandal and incompetence that is the hallmark of this disgraceful government.

Apple launches Lockdown Mode to block spywareThe new feature will be available in the autumn and comes after its devices were successfully targeted.,"A woman uses her phone outside the offices of NSO Apple has announced a new security feature to protect high-risk users from spyware cyber-attacks. Lockdown Mode will be available in the autumn with the next operating system across all of the company's iPhones, iPads and Macs. The setting blocks certain functions and prevents unknown users from calling. It comes after Apple devices owned by activists, politicians and journalists were infected with spyware. Apple is currently suing Israeli spyware firm NSO Group,accusing it of targeting victims in 150 different countries with its powerful Pegasus spyware. The firm's software could infect both iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. NSO Group says its tools are made to target terrorists and criminals and insists it only supplies Pegasus to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. NSO Group: Israeli spyware company added to US trade blacklist Pegasus spyware seller: Blame our customers, not us, for hacking When the extent of the alleged surveillance was revealed last July, Apple faced criticism from privacy and security experts for not protecting users. It quickly released an emergency software update to all devices to patch up the vulnerability that Pegasus had secretly been using for years. Now the company is releasing Lockdown Mode as a wider security feature it claims can protect devices from all known spyware currently on the market. Lockdown Mode will include the following protections: Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked. Some features, like link previews, are disabled Web browsing: Certain complex web technologies, like just-in-time JavaScript compilation, are disabled unless the user excludes a trusted site Calls: Incoming invitations including FaceTime calls, are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request Wired connections with a computer or accessory are blocked when iPhone is locked At launch, Lockdown Mode will be available to all users in the device settings, but Apple suggests it should only be activated if someone is a risk of what it calls ""mercenary spyware attacks"" - for example a journalist or opposition leader in a repressive regime. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? ""While the vast majority of users will never be victims of highly targeted cyber-attacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are,"" said Ivan KrstiÄ, Apple's head of security engineering and architecture. Apple announced it will double the bounty threshold it pays out to ethical hackers who discover security flaws in Lockdown Mode to $2m (Â£1.7m). The US firm will also donate $10m to a fund helping organisations expose the misuse of spyware. ""The global spyware trade targets human rights defenders, journalists, and dissidents, and facilitates violence, reinforces authoritarianism, and supports political repression,"" said Lori McGlinchey, director, technology and society at the Ford Foundation, which will oversee the grant. In November, US officials placed NSO Group on a trade blacklist, saying the software had ""enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists"". NSO Group is also being sued by WhatsApp, which accuses it of using the messaging service as a vehicle to spread Pegasus.
