Covid mass-testing finds 700 no-symptom cases,"Military personnel have been drafted to help at test sites including at Liverpool FC's stadium A mass Covid-19 testing trial in Liverpool has found 700 people unknowingly had the virus. Public Health England director Dr Susan Hopkins said nearly 100,000 people had been tested over the last 10 days. She stressed that these positive cases would have not been detected otherwise. About 2,000 soldiers have been deployedin the city for the project, which was intended to run for an initial period of 10 to 14 days. Devices which give results within an hour have been used to test people in the city since the scheme began on 6 November. Mass testing will be rolled out to 67 more areas in England Liverpool had among the highest rates of deaths from coronavirus in October, when it became the first area in Englandto face the tightest restrictionsbefore the second national lockdown. Speaking at aDowning Street press briefing, Dr Hopkins said ""we are looking to replicate this across the country"". She said:  ""We are also running evaluations in schools and universities and are planning to test university students prior to going home at Christmas."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace visited a test centre at Exhibition Centre Liverpool on Monday and said the Army would assist with the programme for ""as long as there is a need"". Soldiers at Liverpool's Anfield stadium which has been turned into a test centre Mr Wallace said: ""The rollout's been good, the soldiers have been welcomed, the public have come from all over the city."" Trooper Dan House, 22, said up to 500 tests a day were being carried out at the site where he was based and people had given soldiers tubs of chocolates as a thank you.

Biden: 'People may die' as Trump transition stalls,"This video can not be played Lack of co-operation from Trump administration 'more embarrassing than debilitating' US President-elect Joe Biden has warned that ""people may die"" if his incoming administration continues to be impeded by incumbent Donald Trump. Mr Biden said co-ordination was needed to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. He called President Trump's refusal to acknowledge he lost the election, despite calls to do so from both sides, ""totally irresponsible"". The Trump campaign launched a flurry of legal challenges in the wake of the 3 November vote to contest ballot counts. The president's team is trying to have courts overturn votes in key states on the grounds that many ballots were invalid or improperly counted. So far those efforts have failed and no evidence of significant fraud has emerged. President-elect Biden, a Democrat, has 306 votes in the electoral college, surpassing the 270 threshold needed to win. Yet Mr Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Monday: ""I won the Election!"" How is President Trump challenging the result? Is this Covid wave in US the worst yet? The government agency that launches transition process - the General Services Administration (GSA), headed by a Trump appointee - has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. This leaves them without access to sensitive government briefings that are normally provided to an incoming administration. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Aides to the president-elect have said that Mr Trump's refusal to engage in a transition also means Mr Biden's team has been excluded from planning around a vaccination distribution strategy. Speaking in his home state of Delaware on Monday, Mr Biden said of the stalled transition: ""Does anyone understand this? It's about saving lives, for real, this is not hyperbole."" ""More people may die if we don't co-ordinate,"" he added. Calling nationwide vaccine distribution a ""huge undertaking"", Mr Biden said that if his team had to wait until 20 January - his presidential inauguration - until they could begin work on the distribution programme, they would be behind by ""over a month, month and a half"". Asked if he would encourage state leaders to reinstate stay-at-home orders, the president-elect sidestepped, and instead called on officials to encourage mask-wearing. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien spoke of a ""professional transition"" to the next administration on Monday. His tone was different from that of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke of a ""second Trump administration"" last week, and others who act as though the president will remain. When I asked Judd Deere, a spokesman here at the White House, about Mr O'Brien's remarks and his own role in the transition, Mr Deere shot the idea down: ""There's not a transition at this point."" When I asked about advice he'd give to those who will come after him, he got a bit testy: ""I don't speak in hypotheticals."" His remarks reinforce those of the secretary of state, but clash with those of the national security adviser, an unsurprising development, given that their boss is himself a bundle of contradictions. He has tweeted about a Biden victory one moment and then reversed himself, and his cabinet secretary, adviser and others reflect his zig-zaggy approach. The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday said the Trump campaign would have to pay nearly $8m (Â£6m) for a vote recount in that state - which Mr Biden appears to have won by 20,000 ballots - if it still wanted one. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount How will this endless US election end? Facebook removes racist posts about Kamala Harris But in a consolation for Mr Trump, Georgia officials said they had found nearly 2,600 ballots that had not been counted in a Republican-leaning county on election night. A voting official in the state, Gabriel Sterling, said the ballots were overlooked because of ""a person not executing their job properly"". The isolated discovery was expected to improve Mr Trump's vote count by a net 800 - not by enough to overturn Mr Biden's lead of more than 14,000 ballots. Georgia is conducting a statewide, by-hand recount because of the 0.3% margin separating the rivals. Meanwhile, the official overseeing the recount, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, told CNN on Monday that he had been coming under pressure from a fellow Republican, Trump ally and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, to disqualify legally posted ballots in certain counties. Mr Graham denied the claim, telling Politico the two had merely had a ""very pleasant"" conversations about signature verification processes.

Johnson 'called Scottish devolution a disaster',"Boris Johnson has come under fire for reportedly telling a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs that devolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. Mr Johnson also reportedly described it as predecessor Tony Blair's ""biggest mistake"". The SNP and Labour have both criticised the prime minister. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Johnson has ""always supported devolution"". ""What he does feel strongly, and I would agree, is that devolution in Scotland has facilitated the rise of separatism and nationalism in the form of the SNP, and that that's trying to break apart the United Kingdom,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Anybody, like the prime minister, who loves the UK wants to keep it together thinks that that's a very, very dangerous and disappointing outcome that we need to battle against."" What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Is Scotland moving towards independence? Devolution not a disaster says Senedd Tory leader Mr Johnson was in a Zoom meeting with Tory MPs representing dozens of seats in northern England on Monday when he is said to have made the remarks. The Sun newspaper reported the PM had told the MPs ""devolution has been a disaster north of the border"". This video can not be played Jenrick: Devolution in Scotland causing ""separatism and nationalism"". SNP MP Drew Henry said the prime minister's comments ""underline the contempt that Boris Johnson and the Scottish Tories have for the people of Scotland"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast he said: ""Effectively what they are saying is it's alright for Scotland to have devolution as long as they vote for the Westminster party we want them to."" Devolution is the name for the way powers once held by the government in Westminster have been passed to elected groups in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved powers include health, housing, fire services, some areas of transport and education. However, Scotland has always had its own education system and a separate legal system. The UK government, based in London, has kept many powers, such as defence, foreign policy and most forms of tax. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and in both parts of Ireland in 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement. It led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some parts of England have directly-elected mayors, who also have devolved powers. The mayor of London, for example, is responsible for transport and policing in the capital. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government brought in devolution for Scotland in 1999, including the setting up of a parliament in Edinburgh. A Downing Street source said: ""The PM has always supported devolution, but Tony Blair failed to foresee the rise of separatists in Scotland. ""Devolution is great - but not when it's used by separatists and nationalists to break up the UK."" This comes six months before vital elections right across the UK, important particularly in Scotland, just when the SNP has been starting to warm up its campaign, and just when discussions about how the UK government ought to respond are taking place too. It is one thing - and, of course, legitimate - for political rivals to criticise each other. But to suggest the way that Scotland has been run for more than a decade is a ""disaster"" is quite another. And the worry among Scottish Tories is the implication that Boris Johnson's understanding of the political situation is far from complete. Read Laura's blog in full Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross insisted the prime minister ""believes in devolution"", adding: ""I'm saying very clearly devolution is not the problem."" In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Ross said: ""The problem has been the SNP government's obsession with separating Scotland from rest of the UK. ""My efforts are focused on holding the SNP government to account, because they have failed. ""Any other discussion is a distraction from the key aim that we have to do to improve services right across the country. ""These are all services that the SNP have been in charge of and in control of for thirteen and half years."" This video can not be played Hendry: PM ""caught red handed"" on Scotland comments Elections for the Scottish Parliament take place next May. The SNP is currently the largest party with 61 MSPs and the Conservative Party is the second-largest with 31 - eight seats ahead of Labour. Ms Sturgeon's SNP says a second referendum on independence - following Scotland's vote against it in 2014 - should happen if her party wins. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. In response to Mr Johnson's reported remarks to Tory MPs, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Worth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories say they're not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament - or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers."" The SNP is seeking a mandate for another independence referendum in May's election She added that the ""only way to protect and strengthen"" the Scottish Parliament was through independence for Scotland. But the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, tweeted: ""Devolution has not been a disaster. The SNP's non-stop obsession with another referendum - above jobs, schools and everything else - has been a disaster."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the ""Neanderthal"" reported remarks made by the PM ""expose the underlying thinking and philosophy in Downing Street"". He told BBC News the comments were ""reminiscent of the voices of Thatcherism and Majorism of the 1980s and 1990s, which were steadfastly opposed to devolution"". ""In my view, what Boris Johnson is doing is defying the popular will of the people of Scotland, and I don't think that's a very good place for any prime minister to be in."" Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, who served as Scottish secretary during the coalition government, said Boris Johnson ""is not making it easier to resist the demands for another independence referendum"". He added that the prime minister was a ""bigger threat to the continuation of the United Kingdom than Nicola Sturgeon or Alex Salmond could  ever hope to be"". It has been suggested by some taking part in the MPs' Zoom meeting that Mr Johnson was answering a question that had been put to him about devolution in England.

NHS Covid-19 app suffers 'blue screen' glitch,"Users reported the app getting ""stuck"" at the logo screen when launched The NHS Covid-19 app has stopped working for many iPhone owners, who are unable to get it to launch. Users report being stuck at a blue loading screen with the contact-tracing app's logo - but nothing else happens. The NHS has published a workaround for the problem in its help files, but has not said what caused the problem or when it will be fixed. Apple does not believe the problem is at its end, since it has not seen the issue arise in other countries' apps. Many different nations use the same underlying technology, which is designed by Apple and Google, to notify users if they were recently near to someone who subsequently tested positive for the virus. Some users have deleted and reinstalled the app to fix the fault, but that deletes useful information - this includes a log of venues the user has checked into via QR barcode scans. The NHS's workaround,externalinstead asks users to reset their iPhone's location and privacy settings. It also recommends users have the most up-to-date version of Apple's iOS operating system downloaded and installed. But carrying out the reset,externalprevents all apps on the handset from using the device's location until they are granted permission again. NHS Covid app updated to 'fix' phantom messages Contact-tracing app not sharing data with police Some users have said they fixed the problem by force-quitting the app - which can be done by flicking the frozen screen up and off the display - and then re-launching it. The problem first emerged last week, but complaints became more frequent over the weekend and into Monday. The cause, however, remains unclear. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it was aware of the issue. ""The app is still scanning, even if the screen appears blue,"" it said. ""There are simple steps iPhone users can take to resolve this issue, which are set out on the app's website, and work is underway to identify the cause. ""Users experiencing this issue should make sure their Apple iOS is updated to the latest version of the software.""

Police 'let people down' on night of Arena bomb,"Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan agreed British Transport Police (BTP) had made mistakes A senior officer at British Transport Police has accepted the force let the public down on the night of the Manchester Arena attack. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan has been giving evidence to the public inquiry into the atrocity. He agreed mistakes were made, including having no officers in the foyer where bomber Salman Abedi hid before the blast which killed 22 people. Mr O'Callaghan said the attack had ""happened on [BTP's] watch"". Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more were injured as they left an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. The inquiry previously heard there wereno police officers on patrolwhen 22-year-old Abedi made his journey from Victoria Station to the City Room. BTP had primary responsibility for policing in the arena foyerÂ due to the proximity of Victoria railway station. ""The attack that happened that night happened on our watch,"" Mr O'Callaghan, who was not working for the force at the time, said. ""There is not a day that goes by when BTP doesn't consider that."" He added: ""Did we let the people down? ""It was our responsibility to police that arena and that attack happened when we were policing it, there were police officers planned to be deployed to the site of the attack and they were not there - so in that term, yes."" Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell Mr O'Callaghan agreed if BTP officers had been in the City Room at the end of the show, Abedi could have been challenged before he detonated his bomb. He acknowledged it was ""unacceptable"" two of the officers on duty had taken a two-hour break including a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab, but it would be ""right and proper"" to wait for the inquiry's findings before taking any further action. John Cooper QC, representing some of the bereaved families, said: ""You'll understand the families' concerns when at least one of them has photographs receiving commendations?"" Mr O'Callaghan said that after the bomb went off, the officers went on to perform ""extremely brave actions"". He also denied the threat of terrorism at the arena had been disregarded by BTP at the time, saying: ""The information officers had at the time was up to 100 concerts a year had been going on at the arenaâ¦there was nothing to focus the mind on people planning a policing response that a person-borne IED was plausible at that time."" Since the attack there have been a number of improvements made to police planning for events at the arena, Mr O'Callaghan told the court. This includes specific counter-terrorism briefings for officers, documented risk assessments specific to each event and more multi-agency meetings. The inquiry continues.

Top strength hurricane heads for Central America,"This video can not be played Heavy rains as Hurricane Iota nears land Hurricane Iota has strengthened as it roars towards Central America, less than two weeks after another devastating storm struck the region. With winds of up to 160mph (260km/h), it is now a category five storm - the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Iota made landfall on Nicaragua's remote eastern coast on Monday evening local time. ""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" said the president of neighbouring Honduras, Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez. Iota is the strongest Atlantic hurricane of the year and only the second November hurricane to reach category five - the last was in 1932. Number of named Atlantic storms breaks records Why do storms have names? Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms In a joint press conference, Mr HernÃ¡ndez and Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei said Central America was the worst affected region in the world by climate change, and highlighted the damage caused by Hurricane Eta earlier in the month. Thousands lost their crops when that storm hit, and parts of Central America remain water logged. Before reaching Central America the storm moved past the Colombian island of Providencia in the Caribbean, cutting off electricity. The country's President IvÃ¡n Duque said the island could have been hit badly by the storm and stressed there had been ""very poor"" communication after it struck. The NHC has warned that heavy rainfall from Iota could lead to ""life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding across portions of Central America"". Iota already caused flooding in Cartagena, a popular tourist destination on Colombia's Caribbean coast. This video can not be played Storm Iota heads towards Central America The effect of the rains could be particularly devastating in areas already drenched by Hurricane Eta two weeks ago. Eta left at least 200 people dead. The worst-hit area was Guatemala's central Alta Verapaz region, where mudslides buried dozens of homes in the village of QuejÃ¡, with some 100 people feared dead. At least 50 deaths were reported elsewhere in Guatemala. Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua have evacuated residents living in low-lying areas and near rivers in the Atlantic coastal region which Iota is expected to hit. A resident of Bilwi, a coastal town in Nicaragua, said some locals were refusing to leave their homes for fear of catching coronavirus in shared shelters. ""Some of us prefer to stay and die in our homes. There has never been a repeat hurricane in such a short time, but what can we do against the force of God and nature,"" Silvania Zamora told AFP news agency. ""We are worried, nervous. Psychologically we are not doing well, because losing our things and starting over is not easy. Some of us have old little houses and we risk losing everything,"" she added. In Honduras, the country's second city and its industrial hub, San Pedro Sula, is bracing for major flooding.

Hungary and Poland block EU Covid-recovery fund,"Hungary and Poland have blocked approval of the EU's budget over a clause that ties funding with adherence to the rule of law in the bloc. The package includes â¬750bn (Â£673bn; $888bn) for a Covid recovery fund. Ambassadors of the 27 member states meeting in Brussels were unable to endorse the budget because the two countries vetoed it. Hungary and Poland have been criticised for violating democratic standards enshrined in the EU's founding treaty. The EU is currently investigating both countries for undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations. The clause threatens to cost them billions of euros in EU funding. EU states had already agreed on the â¬1.1tn budget for 2021-2027, and the coronavirus stimulus package after a marathon four-day summit in July. This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel, speaking in July, said the post-virus recovery package was a ""pivotal moment"" The ambassadors had voted through the clause that made access to EU funds conditional on adherence to the rule of law, because it only required a qualified majority, the German EU presidency said. But the budget and the rescue package needed unanimous support and were then blocked by Poland and Hungary. This is a row that's come to a head after simmering for the past four months. It was back in July, when EU leaders first agreed to club together and raise almost â¬2tn to spend over the next seven years, as they try to recover from the financial crisis caused by Covid. At the time, the agreement was hailed as a ""magic moment"" by the EU Council President Charles Michel, who said it was ""unprecedented"", because access to cash would be conditional on countries following the rule of law. But Hungary and Poland haven't viewed the arrangement that way, and both countries have long been at loggerheads with the EU over perceived backsliding of core values. On Monday, they refused to support the plan. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n had sent a note in advance of the meeting, to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, making clear his intention, claiming the rule of law clause ""jeopardises trust"" between member states. Final approval needs unanimity, and now the entire process hangs in the balance, with other member states making it clear they desperately need access to the money come January. ""We cannot support the plan in its present form to tie rule of law criteria to budget decisions,"" said Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Polish judge suspended in row over court shake-up Hungary 'broke EU law' by forcing out university Why fractious EU still believes together is better Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki threatened a veto last week. On Monday, Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the rule of law issue was ""just a pretext"". ""It is really an institutional, political enslavement, a radical limitation of sovereignty,"" he said. But Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, addressing a conference shortly after the budget was blocked, said that ""upholding the principles of the rule of law is an absolute necessity"" because the sums being handed out by the EU to member states were so vast. Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said the rule-of-law clause was an important protection to ensure taxpayer's money is ""spent in a just and effective manner"". He called on EU states ""to work together"" adding: ""We need to refocus and get this agreement done."" German ambassador Michael Clauss, who chaired the meeting, warned that the EU would face ""a serious crisis"" if the financial package was not quickly adopted. ""We have already lost a lot of time in view of the second pandemic wave and the severe economic damage,"" he said. The pandemic has caused economic hardship across Europe, like here in Madrid where people queued for food donations In a tweet, Johannes Hahn, EU-Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said he was ""disappointed"" by the veto. He urged member states to ""assume political responsibility and take the necessary steps to finalise the entire package"". ""This is not about ideologies but about help for our citizens in the worst crisis since World War Two,"" he added. The impasse will be debated by EU European affairs ministers on Tuesday and by EU leaders in a video-conference on Thursday. However, officials say a solution might take longer to find.

Level 4 move could 'ease' Christmas rules for Scots,"This video can not be played FM: More restrictions now may allow easing at Christmas Introducing tougher Covid restrictions in the west of Scotland now could help pave the way to easing the rules over Christmas, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister believed it was ""likely"" but ""not inevitable"" that some areas would be moved into level four. She said infection rates were still ""stubbornly high"" in some areas. And that could lead to ""less flexibility"" for some limited easing of restrictions over the Christmas period - something she was ""very keen to do"". She said the rates of infection also meant that the Scottish government ""do not have as much assurance as we would want"" that hospitals and intensive care facilities would be able to cope over the winter. Teachers asked if they would strike over Covid Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Covid rules: What's law and what's not? Ms Sturgeon said that moving to level four restrictions ""for a limited period in some areas"" would address both of those concerns. She explained: ""Where we have stubbornly high prevalence, if we want to protect our NHS and if we want to get to a point at Christmas where we might be able to have a bit of easing of restrictions, albeit that will be very careful, then we need to get that prevalence down more right now."" Questioned at her daily briefing, she said: ""I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here - because there is lots of consideration and discussions, not least across the four nations of the UK right now - before we get to a settled point before Christmas. ""But if you are asking me my priority for Christmas it is to allow families some ability to get together. ""That should be the priority, and if we do go to level four for any areas tomorrow then part of it, not the whole reason, is to try to get prevalence down to the point where we think we can have some limited easing around that."" Ms Sturgeon said the council areas in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the possible exception of Inverclyde, were causing the most concern, along with North and South Lanarkshire. Level four may well be coming for the west of Scotland. All the government indicators suggest it should be, but the reluctance until now can perhaps be explained by more than just economic consequences. The effects of loneliness and isolation on people's mental health are already at alarming levels, doctors tell me. Closing cafes where people who live on their own at least have a chance to meet someone will exacerbate that. It will likely put even more pressure onto GPs, with community support services unable to operate in the same way. And then for shielders. The governments strategic framework says that level four would see the chief medical officer write an automatic two week fit note for those in the shielding category. That could affect staffing in the NHS or in schools and other vital services. Later, she added: ""I think it is likely that we will see some areas go to level four this week. ""But is it inevitable? Until we have taken that final decision, no of course it's not."" The next decision about restriction levels will be made on Tuesday, with any changes taking effect from Friday. In level four bars and restaurants, non-essential shops, gyms and indoor sports facilities would close - but schools would remain open. Prof Linda Bauld, an expert in public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she thought it was ""highly likely"" that large parts of central Scotland would be placed in level four. She said the rolling average of cases per 100,00 people was about 143 in Scotland. ""For Greater Glasgow and Clyde it is up to 247. That is very high - and Lanarkshire is just below that at 241. ""So action clearly does need to be taken,"" she said. The latest figures show that a further 717 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, and six more deaths have been recorded. Ms Sturgeon added that an era was ""firmly on the horizon"" where better therapies, vaccines, testing and treatments would be available. ""The end is not quite with us, but we can see hope on the horizon now that we couldn't see just a few weeks ago,"" she added. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Grenfell insulation firm behaved 'dishonestly',"A former employee from the company which made the combustible insulation used on Grenfell Tower in west London has admitted behaving unethically. Jonathan Roper of Celotex told a public inquiry that the work he did to get the insulation approved for use on high rise buildings was ""dishonest"". He added that he felt ""incredibly uncomfortable"" with what he was being asked to do at the time. Celotex says following disciplinary processes, staff have left the company. Thefirst phase of the Grenfell inquiryconcluded that cladding put on during the refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. It is now examining how the tower block blaze could have happened in the first place. Four possible reasons for the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell recommendations 'will be implemented' Who were the victims? Mr Roper, a former product manager at Celotex, told the inquiry on Monday that the way in which the company presented the results of its fire test was misleading. He said that Celotex should have considered not selling its products for use on high-rise buildings. In 2013, while being asked to research how Celotex insulation could be approved for use on buildings over 18m, Mr Roper had written to colleagues asking if they should take the view that the materials ""realistically should not be used behind most cladding panels, because in the event of a fire it would burn"". He told the inquiry that the responses he received from colleagues made it clear that Celotex was determined to launch the insulation - known as Rs5000 - onto the market regardless of how it could pass fire tests. Mr Roper accepted that the discussion within the company was whether Celotex complied with the building regulations or bent the rules to make more money. After a first test failure in January 2014, a second system passed in May 2014, but Celotex failed to disclose additional non-combustible elements which it added to prevent this system from failing, the inquiry heard. On Monday, the inquiry heard Celotex added a 6mm fire-resisting magnesium oxide board to a cladding test rig made up of 12mm fibre cement panels for the second test. The inquiry heard 8mm fibre cement panels were added over the magnesium oxide to ""conceal"" its presence, making the whole system almost flush - but for the 2mm difference. Mr Roper agreed with the inquiry's chief lawyer Richard Millett QC that the decision to use ""a thinner layer was to make it less noticeable there was something else behind it"", which would aid to ""see off any prospect of anyone asking questions"" about its make-up. The inquiry's chief lawyer Richard Millett QC asked: ""Did that not strike you at the time as dishonest?"" Mr Roper said: ""Yes it did. I went along with a lot of actions at Celotex that, looking back on reflection, were completely unethical and that I probably didn't potentially consider the impact of at the time. ""I was 22 or 23, first job, I thought this was standard practice, albeit it did sit very uncomfortably with me."" Mr Roper said his superiors ordered the removal of any mention in marketing literature of the magnesium oxide. He agreed that was ""misleading and intended to mislead"". Mr Millett asked: ""Did you realise at the time that if this was how the test was to be described to the market it would be a fraud on the market?"" Mr Roper said: ""Yes I did. ""I felt incredibly uncomfortable with it. I felt incredibly uncomfortable with what I was asked to do."" Mr Roper said there was no-one in the firm he could tell about his concerns. Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast Grenfell insulation 'never passed fire test' In its opening statement for the second phase of the inquiry, Celotex said: ""In the course of investigations carried out by Celotex after the Grenfell Tower fire, certain issues emerged concerning the testing, certification and marketing of Celotex's products... These matters involved unacceptable conduct on the part of a number of employees."" The inquiry has previously heard Celotex saw Grenfell as a ""flagship"" for its product and cynically exploited the ""smoke of confusion"" which surrounded building regulations at the time. Celotex, part of the French multinational Saint-Gobain group, has maintained it promoted Rs5000's use on buildings taller than 18m only on a ""rainscreen cladding system with the specific components"", used when it passed the fire safety test.

Alcohol ban comes into force on ScotRail networkPeople are no longer allowed to drink alcohol on trains or at stations as part of measures to stem Covid.ScotlandComments,"The rail operator said the measure would help to maintain the physical distancing required when travelling A ban on the consumption of alcohol on trains and at stations in Scotland has come into effect. ScotRail said the temporary policy had been put in place to support public health measures and keep people safe during the Covid pandemic. The rail operator said the new measures would help to maintain the physical distancing required while travelling. British Transport Police has been asked to assist railway staff to ensure the new guidelines are being followed. ScotRail said the restriction would be reviewed continuously as government guidelines changed and it was not intended to be permanent. It comes amid warnings that parts of the central belt face being placed under thehighest level of Covid restrictions to stem the rate of infection. Councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire andStirling health board areashave been told it is possible they may need to move from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. The consumption of alcohol had previously been banned on ScotRail services between 21:00 and 10:00. However, that has now been extended to all journeys. David Lister, ScotRail sustainability and safety assurance director, said the operator had been encouraged by compliance with safety measures so far, including the use of face coverings on trains, which he said stood at about 90%. He said that people would be ""politely"" encouraged to comply with the new alcohol measures and that on-train and station staff would have body cameras to record breaches. He added: ""If they don't comply we will be contacting the British Transport Police to deal with the matter."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Glitch sees French radio station kill off A-listPublic radio station RFI says a ""technical problem"" meant the obituaries were published prematurely.","The Queen, who is very much alive, was on the list published by mistake A French radio station has apologised after publishing the obituaries of several prominent - and alive - people, including the Queen. Others on the list that went live prematurely on the website of Radio France Internationale included Clint Eastwood, Pele and Brigitte Bardot. A ""technical problem"" led to the publication, RFI said. ""We offer our apologies to the people concerned and to you who follow and trust us,"" the broadcaster added. Broadcasters and media outlets often prepare obituary material in order to be able to publish it promptly when a death is announced. The problem occurred when RFI was moving its website to a different content management system, according to its statement. It said ""around a hundred"" draft stories were published in error - not just to its own site but to partner sites including Google and Yahoo. French businessman Bernie Tapie, 77, who was on the list of people who had their death notice published by RFI, has had his obituary published on at least two other occasions by other news outlets. Others who made the cut on this occasion included Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former US President Jimmy Carter and Cuba's Raul Castro. None of them are currently dead. RFI has said it is ""mobilising to rectify this major bug"".

'Weeks' before Covid Christmas rules agreedMinisters are in talks over rules to be in place over the festive period across the UK.Wales politicsComments,"This video can not be played We cannot go back to normal, says health minister It could be ""weeks"" before there is an announcement on the Covid rules around Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. Welsh ministers and other UK administrations are in talks over a set of agreed rules for the festive period. Vaughan Gething said whatever happened, the period would ""not be like normal"". ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" he told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" Students going home should travel by 9 December Not all students in Wales will get Covid tests Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic There had been calls for a single approach from the different UK administrations about Christmas so families who live in different areas can deal with a single set of rules. Vaughan Gething said this Christmas would ""not be like normal"" Mr Gething said discussions were ongoing about what will be in place for travel, ""and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact"". ""But it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks"", he added. He noted thatother faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. Meanwhile Mr Gething said the rate of cases in Wales was continuing to fall, one week after Wales' firebreak lockdown. Cases in Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen the highest case rate of any local authority in the UK, have more than halved, he said. ""On Friday, I said we were starting to see some very early positive signs that cases of coronavirus are beginning to fall. This downward trend is continuing."" The seven-day incidence rate for Wales is now at about 160 cases per 100,000 people - a reduction of 70 from this time last week, he said. He also said people needed to be aware of the differences between coronavirus and seasonal flu, with the former having a higher mortality rate and a greater proportion of sufferers becoming seriously ill. After the news ofanother potentially effective vaccine, Mr Gething said he ""doesn't plan"" to make Covid vaccines mandatory. He said he had never tried to mandate any vaccine, and would not want to do so with Covid. ""I'm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine , then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their community"" he added. This video can not be played Shoppers are back in Cardiff after lockdown ends On Sunday, Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said it was a""worry"" to see queues of people outside shopsat the weekend. Mr Gething said there had been ""pent-up demand"" after the firebreak, with retailers operating limits on numbers in their stores. While he had seen pictures of people socially-distancing, ""I have seen some images that are more concerning where people have forgotten about social distancing and are returning to a more normal way of behaving. ""Now, if that continues we really will face difficult choices, and we're likely to see the trend that we've already seen with reducing cases - that can easily reverse.""

PM and Tory MPs self-isolating after No 10 meeting,"Downing Street says the prime minister and MP Lee Anderson were standing ""side by side"" and observed guidelines and distancing advice during their meeting with on Thursday Boris Johnson, six Tory MPs and two political aides are self-isolating after a breakfast meeting inside Downing Street last Thursday. One of the MPs, Lee Anderson, later tested positive for Covid-19, and on Sunday the prime minister was told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Ina video from No 10,external, Mr Johnson urged others to ""follow the rules"" if contacted by the system. The PM's official spokesman insisted that Downing Street is ""Covid-secure"". He said ""social distancing did happen"" but factors such as the length of the meeting were considered by Test and Trace. Mr Johnson, who wasadmitted to intensive carewith coronavirus seven months ago, spent about 35 minutes with Mr Anderson - who lost his sense of taste the day after the meeting. The five other MPs self-isolating following the meeting with ""Red Wall""  Tories include: Heywood & Middleton MPChris Clarkson South Ribble MPKatherine Fletcher Warrington South MPAndy Carter Great Grimsby MPLia Nici Bassetlaw MPBrendan Clarke-Smith Mr Johnson's spokesman declined to name the aides but suggested they were not Lee Cain or Dominic Cummings,who left Downing Street last week. Jacob Young, MP for Redcar, is also self-isolating - but said he was not at the meeting - while Basingstoke MP Maria Miller has said she is self-isolating after having been contacted by Test and Trace. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was right to self-isolate as ""it is important for all of us to say that we have got to comply with the advice and guidance"".

The PM's period of isolation began as the government prepares a policy relaunch. Downing Street said a series of ""critical announcements"" would this week detail Mr Johnson's ""ambitions for the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson will chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". The prime minister had been expected to lead a No 10 news conference on Monday but Health Secretary Matt Hancock took his place. However, Mr Johnson is hoping to take part in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons virtually, Downing Street said. How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said the prime minister's self-isolation would make no difference to the amount of work he would be able to do ""driving forward the agenda"". Asked if the PM and Mr Anderson followed social distancing rules during their meeting, he said there were rules ""around Downing Street being a Covid-secure workplace"". He added: ""The central point is that it doesn't matter who you are, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate that is what you must do."" Photos of Mr Johnson and several Tory MPs show them standing close together. The prime minister had to self-isolate after one of them, Mr Anderson, developed Covid symptoms. Guidelines for offices require social distancing of 2m (6ft), or 1m plus precautions such as frequent cleaning and one-way systems where that is not possible. No 10 is yet to respond to a request from BBC Reality Check for details of the Covid-secure guidelines in Downing Street. But the PM's spokesman said ""social distancing did happen"" and that the picture shows Mr Johnson and Mr Anderson ""stood side-by-side, rather than face-to-face"". However, Test and Trace guidance defines a close contact as someone you spent more than 15 minutes with at a distance of under 2m. Mr Johnson's meeting with Mr Anderson lasted about 35 minutes and he would therefore be required to self-isolate if they were not more than 2m apart. In his video posted on Twitter, the PM said: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace is working ever-more efficiently, but the bad news is that they've pinged me and I've got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid. ""It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great. ""And actually, it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies. We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace."" According to No 10, the prime minister has had at least one antibody test for coronavirus. It remains unclear what effect, if any, previously having the coronavirus has on a person's immunity but experts think reinfection is likely to be rare,BBC health correspondent James Gallagher has reported. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said there have been more than 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reinfection globally. He added: ""I think most of us think the rate of reinfection is quite a lot higher than that, but not enormous."" Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14 day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? On Thursday, Mr Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield, posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" On Sunday, he posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable, after they both tested positive. The PMwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night that he had been notified by NHS Test and Trace that he must self-isolate as he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, and he would be working from No 10. The new policy plans follow thedramatic departure of the PM's chief adviserDominic Cummings last week. Over the weekend,senior Tory MPs said his exitwas a chance to ""reset government"" and a series of announcements are planned for this week, including the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs is scheduled to take place via online video conference later on Monday.

"Covid mass-testing finds 700 no-symptom casesNearly 100,000 people have been tested for the virus over 10 days in Liverpool.","Military personnel have been drafted to help at test sites including at Liverpool FC's stadium A mass Covid-19 testing trial in Liverpool has found 700 people unknowingly had the virus. Public Health England director Dr Susan Hopkins said nearly 100,000 people had been tested over the last 10 days. She stressed that these positive cases would have not been detected otherwise. About 2,000 soldiers have been deployedin the city for the project, which was intended to run for an initial period of 10 to 14 days. Devices which give results within an hour have been used to test people in the city since the scheme began on 6 November. Mass testing will be rolled out to 67 more areas in England Liverpool had among the highest rates of deaths from coronavirus in October, when it became the first area in Englandto face the tightest restrictionsbefore the second national lockdown. Speaking at aDowning Street press briefing, Dr Hopkins said ""we are looking to replicate this across the country"". She said:  ""We are also running evaluations in schools and universities and are planning to test university students prior to going home at Christmas."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace visited a test centre at Exhibition Centre Liverpool on Monday and said the Army would assist with the programme for ""as long as there is a need"". Soldiers at Liverpool's Anfield stadium which has been turned into a test centre Mr Wallace said: ""The rollout's been good, the soldiers have been welcomed, the public have come from all over the city.""

Facebook removes racist posts about Kamala HarrisDemocrats have criticised the social network for not doing enough to remove hate speech.Technology,"Facebook has taken down a string of racist and misogynistic posts, memes and comments about US Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris. The social network removed the content after BBC News alerted it to three groups that regularly hosted hateful material on their pages. Facebook says it takes down 90% of hate speech before it is flagged. One media monitoring body described the pages as ""dedicated to propagating racist and misogynistic smears"". However, despite the pages being places where hate-speech is regularly directed towards the vice-president-elect, Facebook said it would not take action on the groups themselves. Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said: ""Facebook's removal of this content only after it's been flagged to them by the media confirms that the rules and guidelines they establish are hollow because they put little to no effort into detection and enforcement. ""We are talking about the lowest of low-hanging fruit from a detection perspective. ""And yet, these escaped Facebook's notice until flagged by a third party."" The pages included accusations Ms Harris was not a US citizen - because her mother was from India and her father from Jamaica. Other comments suggested she was not ""black enough"" for the Democrats. Another post said she should be ""deported to India"". And, in several memes, her name is mocked. One of the pages has 4,000 members, another 1,200. A series of other sexually graphic and misogynistic submissions were also removed. Facebook has been repeatedly criticised by advertisers and civil-rights groups for not doing enough to tackle hate speech. In August, hundreds of companies stopped advertising on the platform in protest. Previously, other campaigners have told BBC News racism and hate speech is not picked up by Facebook's internal moderation tools - and in some situations even promoted.

Plea to PM as virus 'ravages' city,"This video can not be played ""For the doubters out there who donât believe in it...itâs here."" Council bosses in Hull are asking the prime minister to take urgent action over an ""astonishing and terrifying"" rise in the number of Covid cases. Council leader Stephen Brady has written a personal letter to Boris Johnson asking him to intervene. He said the city had one of the highest infection rates and the virus was ""now ravaging our communities more than anywhere else in our country"". The government has been approached for comment. Hull currently has 770 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 people, and in his letter Mr Brady said: ""I am writing to express my grave concerns about the consequences of the current Covid-19 health emergency in Hull and the absence of central government support to assist us in overcoming it. ""As I am sure you are aware, our infection rate is now one of the highest in the country and... the infection rates in our city have increased at a, frankly, astonishing and terrifying rate over the last few weeks. ""We are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for the absolute minimum we need to get through this pandemic."" More news from across Yorkshire Mr Brady is calling for a range of measures to be introduced including more freedom to put local restrictions in place, particularly with regard to schools, and additional support and resources for health. He also wants discussions on the financial support needed for local businesses and about what will happen when the current restrictions end. ""We will not stand by and let Hull be forgotten,"" he said in a statement. ""I am hopeful that the prime minister will take this letter seriously and will urgently speak to us about what the government will do.""

Alcohol ban comes into force on ScotRail network,"The rail operator said the measure would help to maintain the physical distancing required when travelling A ban on the consumption of alcohol on trains and at stations in Scotland has come into effect. ScotRail said the temporary policy had been put in place to support public health measures and keep people safe during the Covid pandemic. The rail operator said the new measures would help to maintain the physical distancing required while travelling. British Transport Police has been asked to assist railway staff to ensure the new guidelines are being followed. ScotRail said the restriction would be reviewed continuously as government guidelines changed and it was not intended to be permanent. It comes amid warnings that parts of the central belt face being placed under thehighest level of Covid restrictions to stem the rate of infection. Councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire andStirling health board areashave been told it is possible they may need to move from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. The consumption of alcohol had previously been banned on ScotRail services between 21:00 and 10:00. However, that has now been extended to all journeys. David Lister, ScotRail sustainability and safety assurance director, said the operator had been encouraged by compliance with safety measures so far, including the use of face coverings on trains, which he said stood at about 90%. He said that people would be ""politely"" encouraged to comply with the new alcohol measures and that on-train and station staff would have body cameras to record breaches. He added: ""If they don't comply we will be contacting the British Transport Police to deal with the matter."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

Why does Boris Johnson have to self-isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious.

WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection.

You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

Why did test-and-trace contact the PM?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Hancock: UK orders 5m doses of Moderna vaccine,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the UK has ordered 5m Moderna vaccines, enough for 2.5m people, which early data suggests is up to 95% effective But he stresses ""we haven't seen the full safety data"" on the vaccine, and the jab won't be available until spring It is not yet clear how long the Moderna vaccine immunity will last, or how well it works with older age groups Dr Susan Hopkins, a Public Health England director, says England's tier system may need to be ""strengthened"" in order to ""get us through the winter months"" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and six other MPs are self-isolating after they attended a breakfast meeting and one later tested positive Meanwhile, a major trial of a vaccine to protect against Covid has launched in the UK - the third such trial in the country The states of Michigan and Washington bring in strict measures as cases in the US top 11 million South Australian authorities say they are facing a ""dangerous situation"" after reporting 18 coronavirus cases in the state's first outbreak since April There have been more than 54 million coronavirus cases and 1.3 million deaths across the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data Edited by Martha Buckley and Helier Cheung Here are some of the main stories from around the
world today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our
teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Sophie Williams, Alice
Evans, Alexandra Fouche, Becky Morton, Max Matza and Doug Faulkner, and the
editors were Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis and Sarah Fowler We'll be pausing our live coverage for the evening shortly so here's a quick summary of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today:  No traces of coroanvirus have been found on trains used by Britain's largest rail franchise, it has said. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said checks on a random selection of carriages used by its Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern brands all returned negative results. The tests were carried out up to 23 days after surfaces frequently touched by passengers and staff were treated with an anti-viral disinfectant. The surfaces included grab rails, tables, toilet handles and door buttons. As well as long-lasting disinfectant, all 2,700 GTR carriages are sanitised overnight using short-term anti-viral sprays and an additional 100 cleaners have been deployed. A further 213 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19,according to figures from the UK government,external, bringing the country's total death toll to 52,147. And 21,363 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the past day. There have been 1,390,681 cases reported in the UK in total. Last week the UK became the first country in Europeto reach the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at the briefing about advice from the government modelling group SPI-M that suggested returning to the three-tiered system in December risked the R value rising again, and undoing any decline in the rate of new cases achieved during England's lockdown. Hancock responded that that was not what the scientific advice had said - that it wasnât just about the tiered system but âalso about what measures are in each tierâ. You can read the SPI-M advicehere,external. It says that what happens to the outbreak depends on what measures are taken after 2 December and that: âIf England returns to the same application of the tiering system in place before 5 November, then transmission will return to the same rate of increase as today.â But clearly that allows for the government to introduce a different application of the tiering system, having different restrictions in each of the tiers than it had before the second lockdown. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The head of the World Health Organization has warned against complacency in the fight against Covid-19, despite the news that some potential vaccines are showing very good results in testing. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus was surging in many parts of the world, and said countries letting it spread unchecked were playing with fire. The news that two vaccines being tested have shown a success rate of 90% or more have sent stock markets soaring, and sighs of relief rippling through governments. But today the WHO offered a reality check: it is likely to be months before vaccines are widely available, in the meantime Covid-19 is surging across Europe and North America. For now, there is no alternative to laborious testing, tracing and isolating. The WHO also wants to ensure vaccines are fairly distributed and has called on G20 leaders to commit to provide vaccines to poorer countries. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government is adamant that it wants Englandâs lockdown
to end on 2 December. But what replaces it is still very much a live discussion in
the corridors of power. There was always a question mark about how much infections
would fall during the lockdown. And clearly the impact has been undermined by the spike in
cases last week, when the daily number jumped by 10,000 to over 33,000 on
Thursday. That rise has been linked to a last bout of socialising
before the lockdown came in. The hope is cases will start falling this week. But it will take much longer for that to filter through into
fewer hospital cases. Hence the suggestion that the regional tiers may need to be
strengthened when lockdown ends. One idea is to create a new tier four, which would see much
tighter restrictions on hospitality opening. But do not expect an announcement soon. Ministers will want
to see exactly what happens to cases over the rest of the month. Dr Scott Atlas was accused of inciting political violence Dr Scott Atlas - a controversial radiologist, member of the White House coronavirus taskforce and a skeptic of virus mitigation efforts such as mask- wearing - has clarified a tweet from yesterday condemning the Michigan's governor's newest lockdown order. In his tweet, he objected to the Democratic governor's order to close many businesses and schools for three weeks amid a surge in new Covid cases. ""The only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept,"" he wrote. The Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was the subject of an alleged kidnapping attempt last month by militia members opposed to virus mitigation efforts. Michigan's state house has also been the scene of several major protests, including one where gun-carrying protesters attempted to storm the legislature. Amid an online backlash, Atlas responded: ""Hey. I NEVER was talking at all about violence. People vote, people peacefully protest. NEVER would I endorse or incite violence. NEVER!!"" Social distancing and mask wearing are recommended by health agencies around the world, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a way to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.

a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the
latest vaccine news has led to a resurgence. One false claim circulating is that a vaccine is a means of inserting
microchips into the population. Other popular, unsubstantiated
claims include the idea that a vaccine will be used to alter our DNA or even as
a weapon of genocide.Reality Check has debunked these claims. This kind of disinformation is a
world away from legitimate concerns about whether a vaccine is safe and
properly tested - concerns that were previously
raised in the US, for example, over fears that vaccine approvals could be rushed
through. Despite commitments to tackle
falsehoods from social media sites and the government, the constant swirl of
conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective
vaccine. The anti-vaccine movement, of course, pre-dates the pandemic -
perhaps because vaccinations have always involved a combination of science that
is difficult to understand, and emotive reactions, including worry, excitement,
and anxiety about being jabbed by a needle. But it is not the only thing responsible for the latest spread of
these conspiracy theories online. Pseudo-science figures with large
online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking
coronavirus to 5G  - have also turned their attention to vaccines. Have you seen suspect posts about
vaccines on your social media feeds? Get in touch -marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Jamie Kaffash, from primary care publication Pulse magazine, asks Matt Hancock if he can reassure GPs he will reduce their non-urgent workload to free up time for the Covid vaccination programme. The health secretary tells every GP that he is very grateful for the work they are doing on flu vaccines and on the ""normal pressures of primary care"". He says he hopes  a Covid vaccination programme will be ready to go, with 1 December the earliest the roll-out could begin. Jonathan Van-Tam says the roll-out is ""going to be biggest and most important thing NHS has done for a very long time"". He says he understands workload pressures but says it will be ""incumbent on all of us"" to make sure this programme moves as fast as it can with highest uptake possible. ""It is a big opportunity to change the way the pandemic will roll out over 2021,"" he says. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will England come out of lockdown on December 2nd?
Boris Johnsonâs always been keen to emphasize that the rules legally expire on
that date. But Matt Hancock strikes a more cautious note, saying itâs too early
to be sure although itâs his âhopeâ that it will be time to go back into the
tiered system. This is a question that will need to be answered soon; MPs have
been told theyâll get a vote on what happens next before the month-long
lockdown is up. A journalist from the Independent asks Matt Hancock whether NHS staff are going to get an above-inflation pay rise. In reply, the health secretary says the government has already agreed a three-year pay deal for nurses. He says an independent pay review of NHS wages is ongoing - and he is ""not going to prejudge"" the results of that. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent It looks like some fervent
negotiations have been going on behind the scenes. Just a few hours ago, the government said it
was in advanced discussions with Moderna to gain access to the vaccine. Now
Matt Hancock has announced a preliminary deal for 5 million doses. Some Tory
MPs think ministers like Matt Hancock have pinned too much, in terms of their Covid
strategy, on the prospect of a vaccine but of course early results from Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna have raised many peopleâs
hopes that this could be crucial in helping the country emerge from
restrictions. Gordon Rayner from the Daily Telegraph asks if the 14-day isolation period may be reconsidered, particularly in light of the prime minister isolating despite ""bursting with antibodies"". Hancock says the prime minister going into self-isolation is a clear demonstration that everybody, no matter who you are, needs to follow the rules. He says they keep such things under review but are not in a position to make any changes. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock has
mentioned two new coronavirus testing âmega labsâ which he said could increase
testing capacity by 600,000 tests a day. But capacity does not mean actually
processing that many tests, just that there is the ability â in theory - to do
that many. For example, on 12 November, there was UK
lab capacity for 520,000 tests, but in reality 380,000 tests were processed. This means labs were running at about 73%
of capacity. The government says on an ideal day they will be working at 85% of capacity, to allow some room if there is a surge
in demand for tests.  There's another question from a journalist from Channel 5 about what measures could replace the England-wide lockdown in December, and whether a return to local tiers could increase infections. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says the tiered restrictions have had a ""different effect"" in each area. She says there is evidence that in tier two - the middle tier - restrictions ""hold in some areas, not so well in others"". She says the rules in tier one - the lowest Covid alert level - have had ""very little effect"" and may need to be ""strengthened"" to help the country ""get through the winter months"". Sky's Thomas Moore asks why the UK government has not bought up some of the Moderna vaccine before now. Matt Hancock says there is not a stockpile, the vaccine has not yet been manufactured and in Europe first availability will be in the spring. ""It is critical we have been buying the first vaccines that will be available,"" he says. He adds that, if you take the Astrazeneca agreements and Pfizer vaccines into account, the UK has more than 100 million doses on order. Jonathan Van-Tam says the spiked coronavirus protein is being targeted by most of the vaccine trials around the world and these early results are beginning to show us this is a ""plausible target for vaccines to be working against"". ""When we started this journey in February/March we didn't even know that, so we are in a happier place than we were,"" he says. BBC Medical Editor Fergus Walsh asks Matt Hancock if he ""regrets"" the UK has not signed a deal for more Moderna vaccine. The health secretary says this vaccine won't come in until the spring - but the UK has already got 40 million of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines on order, and they are likely to come on stream earlier. He adds though that neither is currently approved. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the UK has purchased vaccines across ""multiple targets"". Reaching for a football metaphor, he says that positive news on Moderna, following the encouraging news earlier this month from Pfizer, is the ""second penalty that has gone into the back of the net"". Diviya from Leicester asks if the national lockdown in England will be extended beyond 2 December if cases and deaths continue to rise. Matt Hancock says it is too early for us to know what the number of cases will be at the end of the current lockdown. He says: ""At the moment most of the tests we are getting back, most of the positive cases, are from around the time when the lockdown came in so it is too early to see in the data the impact of the second lockdown. ""But we absolutely hope to be able to replace the national lockdown with a tiered system similar to the one we had before."" But he says that is still being assessed. Â© 2025 BBC.

Moderna Covid vaccine shows nearly 95% protection,"This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? A new vaccine that protects against Covid-19 is nearly 95% effective, early data from US company Moderna shows. The results come hot on the heels of similar results from Pfizer, and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end the pandemic. Both companies used a highly innovative and experimental approach to designing their vaccines. Moderna says it is a ""great day"" and they plan to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the next few weeks. However, this is still early data and key questions remain unanswered. The trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections. The analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms. Only five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5% of people. The data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised. ""The overall effectiveness has been remarkable... it's a great day,"" Tal Zaks, the chief medical officer at Moderna, told BBC News. Dr Stephen Hoge, the company's president, said he ""grinned ear to ear for a minute"" when the results came in. He told BBC News: ""I don't think any of us really hoped that the vaccine would be 94% effective at preventing Covid-19 disease, that was really a stunning realisation."" That depends on where you are in the world and how old you are. Moderna says it will apply to regulators in the US in the coming weeks. It expects to have 20 million doses available in the country. The company hopes to have up to one billion doses available for use around the world next year and is planning to seek approval in other countries too. The UK has today announced that, from spring, it will have five million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to vaccinate 2.5 million people. It has alreadyoutlined plansthat prioritise the oldest people for immunisation. We still do not know how long immunity will last as volunteers will have to be followed for much longer before that can be answered. There are hints it offers some protection in older age groups, who are most at risk of dying from Covid, but there is not full data. Mr Zaks told the BBC their data so far suggests the vaccine ""does not appear to lose its potency"" with age. And it is not known whether the vaccine just stops people becoming severely ill, or if it stops them spreading the virus too. All these questions will affect how a coronavirus vaccine is used. No significant safety concerns have been reported, but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe. Short lived fatigue, headache and pain were reported after the injection in some patients. ""These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,"" said Prof Peter Openshaw, from Imperial College London. Moderna scientists used an innovative technique for developing the vaccine so quickly Both vaccines use the same approach of injecting part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. The preliminary data we have seen so far is very similar - around90% protection for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccineand around 95% for Moderna's. However, both trials are still taking place and the final numbers could change. Moderna's vaccine appears to be easier to store as it remains stable at minus 20C for up to six months and can be kept in a standard fridge for up to a month. Pfizer's vaccine needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75C, but it can be kept in the fridge for five days. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released very early data whichsuggests it is 92% effective. Moderna has developed an ""RNA vaccine"" - it means part of the coronavirus's genetic code is injected into the body. This starts making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack. It should train the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. In the space of a week, the positive results from Pfizer, Moderna and Russia have transformed our chances of ending the pandemic. Before the first results, the talk was of a vaccine that offered maybe 50% protection. Those expectations have been blown out of the water - not only are vaccines possible, they appear to be potent. The data so far also raise hopes that the other vaccines in development will be successful too, but now as one challenge draws to an ends, another begins. The logistical effort of actually vaccinating, potentially billions of people, around the world is gargantuan. Some experts have claimed normalityby spring, othersby next winter, others still think there is a long journey ahead. The answer will depend on how quickly countries can get this ""hope in a vial"" into the arms of people. This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" ""This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months,"" said Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London. He added: ""We need more complete details than we have in this press release, but this announcement adds to the general feeling of optimism."" Prof Trudie Lang, from the University of Oxford, said: ""It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. ""This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo."" Dr Richard Hatchett, the head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said: ""The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.""

Why does PM have to isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.

This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well.

Global shares jump on second Covid vaccine hopes,"Global share prices have surged following news of a second breakthrough coronavirus vaccine, following last week's positive results from Pfizer. Interim data from the US firm Moderna suggests its vaccine is highly effective in preventing people getting ill and works across all age groups. The news pushed Moderna shares more than 9% higher and the Dow to a record. It also lifted firms hit by the virus, with British Airways owner IAG rising 10% and Cineworld up 13.5%. In the US, theDow Jones Industrial Averagehit a new high, after jumping about 1.6%. The widerS&P 500increased almost 1.2% from Friday's record and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%. Earlier, the UK'sFTSE 100 share indexclosed about 1.6% higher, while the main market in Paris rose 1.7% and in Germany shares gained 0.5%. Last week, stock markets enjoyed one of their best ever days when a vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech raised hopes that the business world might return to normal next year. A number of other vaccines are also being developed. The gains spurred by Moderna's news on Monday were more muted but still helped the MSCI World Index of global shares to rise further, climbing to a new record high. Firms that have been hit most badly in the pandemic have seen the biggest rises. In the travel sector, cruise line Carnival jumped more than 10%, while Intercontinental Hotels closed almost 5% higher. The prospect of an end to lockdowns also helped oil prices strengthen. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices were up about 3%, and shares in energy companies also gained. The price of gold - which is often seen as a safer asset in times of uncertainty - slipped 0.7% before recovering. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said markets are being driven by a ""tug-of-war between optimism over COVID-19 vaccine progress versus fear of economic slowing as COVID-19 cases continue to rise"". But he said low interest rates, stimulus and medical progress give him a ""glass half-full"" outlook. ""We expect equity prices to inch higher into year-end and 2021, with increased volatility being more the norm than exception,"" he said, Until vaccines can be rolled out, rising cases of the coronavirus were a risk, said Morgan Stanley strategists in a research note to investors. But the investment bank urged shareholders to ""keep the faith... We think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy"".

'We have to get through this first',"After the euphoria of a vaccine breakthrough, it did not take long for the virus to provide a reality check. Within days of the news that an effective vaccine may have been found, it was being announced the UK was the first European country to pass the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. This was quickly followed by a record rise in new caseswith 33,400 reported on Thursday. Both are a clear reminder, if we needed one, that there are many more difficult days to come. So what's in store? Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised the NHS will be ready to start rolling out the vaccine from 1 December if its passes its final regulatory hurdles. But that doesn't mean the epidemic will be brought to a sudden halt. There is a huge logistical exercise in vaccinating large numbers of people - the UK has bought enough for 20 million people. And don't forget, unlike the flu vaccine, this one requires two doses. Health and care workers along with older age groups will be prioritised. But given it takes a month from the first dose for an individual to get the full protection and the fact there are 12 million over 65s - nine in 10 deaths have been in this age group - winter is likely to be well gone by the time significant numbers are protected. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was unequivocal this week when he said he didn't see the vaccine ""making any difference"" this winter. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths In the meantime infection rates remain high. Despite seeing over 30,000 cases on Thursday, the UK is averaging over 20,000 confirmed infections a day. However, estimates from the government's surveillance run by the Office for National Statisticssuggests the true figure may be double that,external. The situation has left hospitals dangerously close to capacity in the most hard-hit regions. NHS trusts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Bradford have all announced the cancellation of non-urgent work to free up beds. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, warns staff are ""exhausted"" and ""traumatised"". If hospital cases keep rising it will quickly begin to affect non-Covid work even more, he says. We were always warned lockdown, which is under way in England, would take time to have an impact. The good news is that cases had started to stabilise before it came in, with strong evidence the regional tiers had begun to have an impact. If the rise in cases on Thursday is a blip - there are suggestions it may be linked to a last bout of socialising before lockdown came in - the expectation is the number of infections will soon start to drop. Friday's figures were 6,000 cases down on the day before, Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid Symptom Study, an app which one million people use, believes the crucial R number - the measure of how many people an infected person passes the virus on to on average - is now below one. This would mean the epidemic should start to shrink. But no-one knows exactly what sort of impact lockdown will have. There have been suggestions the number of infections could be reduced by three-quarters. But the early evidence from Wales' 17-day fire-break is that it stemmed the rise in cases rather than significantly shrinking it. There could be a delayed impact and England's lockdown is longer, but clearly nothing is guaranteed. Northern Ireland, meanwhile, has just extended some of its national restrictions because of concern about infection levels. And the problem is that once lockdown is lifted in England, cases are likely to take off again. It is, after all, winter, when respiratory viruses tend to thrive. Does that mean another lockdown in a few months? This is the nagging fear. Ministers are just ""deferring the problem"", says Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, who sits on the government's committee on modelling. Even if we had had the lockdown earlier, as some scientists had argued, we would have already been talking about the next one. Those backing lockdown argued it could be used to fix the test-and-trace system, which identifies close contacts of infected individuals and asks them to isolate. Each nation runs its own tracing service, but all have faced the same problem - such high rates of infection make test-and-trace more difficult and less effective. In England, councils are working hard to set up local teams to support the national system. But most of these are in their infancy and will take some time to bed in. The government has started piloting mass testing in the hope it could be a way of containing the virus given significant numbers of infected people show very mild, or even no, symptoms. The first pilot in Liverpool has been followed by others being set up inmore than 60 local authority areas. Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool But some question how effective this approach will be. The rapid tests being used are ""not fit for purpose"" says Prof John Deeks, an expert in testing at Birmingham University. He points to evidence suggesting they may miss up to half of Covid cases. He also says identifying previously undetected cases only works if those that test positive isolate. Evidence on those going through the standard testing process is that they are not always doing this. A need to work and earn money is, understandably, a key issue. This brings us back to vaccination. While the breakthrough is great news, the jury is still out as to how much impact it will have. For example, we don't know how well it works in the elderly, whether it stops people passing it on or simply stops them getting ill or how long immunity lasts. Even with the vaccine the virus is ""not going away"", says Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Sage advisory group. It is, he says, now part of humanity and here to stay. Instead, the most we can hope for is providing some protection to those who are most at risk. The sad reality is that, despite the vaccine breakthrough, we are still going to have to learn to live with Covid this winter - and beyond.

Moderna Covid vaccine shows nearly 95% protectionThe results add to growing confidence that vaccination can end the pandemic.HealthComments,"This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? A new vaccine that protects against Covid-19 is nearly 95% effective, early data from US company Moderna shows. The results come hot on the heels of similar results from Pfizer, and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end the pandemic. Both companies used a highly innovative and experimental approach to designing their vaccines. Moderna says it is a ""great day"" and they plan to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the next few weeks. However, this is still early data and key questions remain unanswered. The trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections. The analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms. Only five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5% of people. The data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised. ""The overall effectiveness has been remarkable... it's a great day,"" Tal Zaks, the chief medical officer at Moderna, told BBC News. Dr Stephen Hoge, the company's president, said he ""grinned ear to ear for a minute"" when the results came in. He told BBC News: ""I don't think any of us really hoped that the vaccine would be 94% effective at preventing Covid-19 disease, that was really a stunning realisation."" That depends on where you are in the world and how old you are. Moderna says it will apply to regulators in the US in the coming weeks. It expects to have 20 million doses available in the country. The company hopes to have up to one billion doses available for use around the world next year and is planning to seek approval in other countries too. The UK has today announced that, from spring, it will have five million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to vaccinate 2.5 million people. It has alreadyoutlined plansthat prioritise the oldest people for immunisation. We still do not know how long immunity will last as volunteers will have to be followed for much longer before that can be answered. There are hints it offers some protection in older age groups, who are most at risk of dying from Covid, but there is not full data. Mr Zaks told the BBC their data so far suggests the vaccine ""does not appear to lose its potency"" with age. And it is not known whether the vaccine just stops people becoming severely ill, or if it stops them spreading the virus too. All these questions will affect how a coronavirus vaccine is used. No significant safety concerns have been reported, but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe. Short lived fatigue, headache and pain were reported after the injection in some patients. ""These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,"" said Prof Peter Openshaw, from Imperial College London. Moderna scientists used an innovative technique for developing the vaccine so quickly Both vaccines use the same approach of injecting part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. The preliminary data we have seen so far is very similar - around90% protection for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccineand around 95% for Moderna's. However, both trials are still taking place and the final numbers could change. Moderna's vaccine appears to be easier to store as it remains stable at minus 20C for up to six months and can be kept in a standard fridge for up to a month. Pfizer's vaccine needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75C, but it can be kept in the fridge for five days. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released very early data whichsuggests it is 92% effective. Moderna has developed an ""RNA vaccine"" - it means part of the coronavirus's genetic code is injected into the body. This starts making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack. It should train the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. In the space of a week, the positive results from Pfizer, Moderna and Russia have transformed our chances of ending the pandemic. Before the first results, the talk was of a vaccine that offered maybe 50% protection. Those expectations have been blown out of the water - not only are vaccines possible, they appear to be potent. The data so far also raise hopes that the other vaccines in development will be successful too, but now as one challenge draws to an ends, another begins. The logistical effort of actually vaccinating, potentially billions of people, around the world is gargantuan. Some experts have claimed normalityby spring, othersby next winter, others still think there is a long journey ahead. The answer will depend on how quickly countries can get this ""hope in a vial"" into the arms of people. This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" ""This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months,"" said Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London. He added: ""We need more complete details than we have in this press release, but this announcement adds to the general feeling of optimism."" Prof Trudie Lang, from the University of Oxford, said: ""It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. ""This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo."" Dr Richard Hatchett, the head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said: ""The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.""

No shortage of flu vaccines in NI says Swann,"The Public Health Agency said uptake of the vaccine has been higher than ever before. There is ""no shortage"" of ordered flu vaccines for Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. NI's GP committee had said that Northern Ireland was almost 200,000 doses short of the flu vaccine. The chair of NI's GP committee had raised concerns that it would not be possible to complete the vaccination programme for those aged over 65. But the Public Health Agency (PHA) now says that this is not the case. Concerns about a shortage of flu vaccine initially emerged after a meeting of GPs and Public Health Agency representatives last week. Dr Alan Stout, chair of NI's GP committee (NIGPC), then wrote to GPs across Northern Ireland and said he was ""deeply concerned and frustrated"" about a shortfall in flu vaccines. The BBC has also learned that after last week's meeting,  Dr Stout wrote to the chief medical officer highlighting their concerns over the shortfall of about 200,000 vaccine doses. In an email to Dr Michael McBride and seen by BBC News NI Dr Alan Stout said: ""You will see that it is far from satisfactory and puts practices in a very difficult situation and really does put at risk the completion of the flu campaign this year. ""Is this all consistent with your own understanding? ""We have a large number of practices with significant numbers of patients still to be vaccinated. We need to get advice to them ASAP about when they can do this and what vaccine they should give. "" But on Monday Dr Gerry Waldron from the PHA said there was not a shortage and he hoped the confusion would not deter those coming forward. Later on Monday Robin Swann also denied there was a shortage and said Northern Ireland had ordered in total 1,050,300 doses for this year. As of last Friday, 826,890 doses had been delivered into Northern Ireland, with 601,243 doses delivered to GPs and health trusts. Flu vaccine clinics 'frantically cancelled' NI to 'pause' flu vaccinations for under-65s Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Mr Swann said two further deliveries had arrived in NI on Monday morning, with the total amount of vaccine delivered now standing at 1,019,590 doses. Thirty thousand doses of childhood vaccine still to be delivered are the ""only remaining order outstanding"", he told the assembly. From the outside looking in, things appear a bit of a mess. Here are two reputable bodies - the Public Health Agency and the NI GP committee - each with their own versions of an important meeting last week. On the one hand GPs have said they were left in no doubt of the shortfall; on Sunday the Public Health Agency confirmed in a statement that postponing clinics would ""inconvenience"" GPs. At no point did the PHA challenge or contradict what GPs had told the BBC. Twenty-four hours on, however, and it is an entirely different story with the PHA adamant that Northern Ireland now has enough vaccine to go around. The British Medical Association has reacted saying it is ""delighted"" with the news. All of this highlights the importance of clear messaging, especially during a pandemic. Communication between health officials and those on the ground needs to be accurate and up to date. All of that will go some way in reassuring the public that when it comes to vaccines, those charged with obtaining and delivering them are in complete control of everything that is going on. The PHA's Dr Gerry Waldron said for those aged over 65, about 296,000 vaccines are in Northern Ireland and this is ""the full amount that was planned"". ""It was always anticipated that stock would arrive in planned batches, and with the initial batch of vaccine for under-65s used up extremely quickly, the decision to pause was purely practical, as it was simply not possible to continue to vaccinate until the next planned tranche of vaccine became available,"" Dr Waldron said. There are two different flu vaccines available for different age groups Following the clarification from Mr Swann and the PHA, Dr Stout said: ""As of 8am when practices opened this morning they did not know that there was additional flu vaccine available in Northern Ireland. ""We've only found that out during the course of the day and the only communication that I have got on that is through the press and through the media. ""It is a good thing that we now know that it is here, but this is part of the confusion, this is part of the problem.""

England tiers may need strengthening - adviser,"England's regional Covid tier system may need to be ""strengthened"" to get the country ""through the winter"", a senior government adviser has said. Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said they needed to look at what ""tiers there may be in the future"" when the lockdown ends on 2 December. A three-tier system was used in England to tackle the spread of coronavirus before the national lockdown began. Matt Hancock said the government hoped to bring back the regional tiers. It comes as the UK announced another 21,363 daily Covid cases, as well as a further 213 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the lockdown rules where you live? Speaking at the government's evening coronavirus briefing, Dr Hopkins, who is also a member of the government's scientific advisory group (Sage), said the ""key"" to knowing if the four-week lockdown in England was working was ""if cases fall"" and they expect to know that ""in the next week"". ""As long as we see cases decline we can make judgments... about opening up,"" she said. She added that, prior to the lockdown, the ""tiering of the country"" had had a ""different effect in each area"". ""Tier three plus"" had led to a reduction in cases in the North West, she said, while tier two ""holds in some areas and not in others"", depending on ""how well individuals are taking that advice in"". However, she added: ""We see very little effect from tier one and when we look at what tiers may be there in the future, we will have to think about strengthening them to get us through the winter months until the vaccine is available for everyone."" The government is adamant that it wants England's lockdown to end on 2 December. But what replaces it is still very much a live discussion in the corridors of power. There was always a question mark about how much infections would fall during the lockdown. And clearly the impact has been undermined by the spike in cases last week when the daily number jumped by 10,000 to over 33,000 on Thursday. That rise has been linked to a last bout of socialising before the lockdown came in. The hope is cases will start falling this week. But it will take much longer for that to filter through into fewer hospital cases - hence the suggestion that the regional tiers may need to be strengthened when lockdown ends. One idea is to create a new tier four, which would see much tighter restrictions on hospitality opening. But do not expect an announcement soon. Ministers will want to see exactly what happens to cases over the rest of the month. Also speaking at the government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock, the health secretary, said it was too early to know the impact of the second lockdown in England, which began on 5 November. ""At the moment, most of the tests we're getting back, and most of the positive cases, are from around the time the lockdown came in, so we are yet to see in the data - and it's too early to expect to see in the data - the impact of the second lockdown,"" he said. ""But we absolutely hope to be able to replace the national lockdown with a tiered system similar to what we had before."" At a briefing on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are committed to setting out next week what the replacement regime will be and that will be a return to the localised approach and we're actively working on those plans at the moment."" Mr Hancock also confirmed: The UK has secured five million doses of the new Moderna vaccine- which has shown in early data that it is nearly 95% effective in protecting against Covid-19. Mr Hancock said that if it was found to be safe, it would be available in the UK in spring next year The NHS will be opening a network of 40 ""long Covid"" clinics across England, which will be in place by the end of the month Two new ""mega labs"" will open early next yearand add another 600,000 to the UK's testing capacity -  doubling the current testing capacity Before England went into its second lockdown, nearly a fifth of the population was living in tier three areas - those under the toughest coronavirus restrictions. They included those in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, the Liverpool City Region, Warrington and Nottinghamshire.

Glitch sees French radio station kill off A-list,"The Queen, who is very much alive, was on the list published by mistake A French radio station has apologised after publishing the obituaries of several prominent - and alive - people, including the Queen. Others on the list that went live prematurely on the website of Radio France Internationale included Clint Eastwood, Pele and Brigitte Bardot. A ""technical problem"" led to the publication, RFI said. ""We offer our apologies to the people concerned and to you who follow and trust us,"" the broadcaster added. Broadcasters and media outlets often prepare obituary material in order to be able to publish it promptly when a death is announced. The problem occurred when RFI was moving its website to a different content management system, according to its statement. It said ""around a hundred"" draft stories were published in error - not just to its own site but to partner sites including Google and Yahoo. French businessman Bernie Tapie, 77, who was on the list of people who had their death notice published by RFI, has had his obituary published on at least two other occasions by other news outlets. Others who made the cut on this occasion included Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former US President Jimmy Carter and Cuba's Raul Castro. None of them are currently dead. RFI has said it is ""mobilising to rectify this major bug"".

England tier system 'may have to be strengthened',"England's regional Covid tier system may need to be ""strengthened"" to get the country ""through the winter"", a senior government adviser has said. Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said they needed to look at what ""tiers there may be in the future"" when the lockdown ends on 2 December. A three-tier system was used in England to tackle the spread of coronavirus before the national lockdown began. Matt Hancock said the government hoped to bring back the regional tiers. It comes as the UK announced another 21,363 daily Covid cases, as well as a further 213 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the lockdown rules where you live? Speaking at the government's evening coronavirus briefing, Dr Hopkins, who is also a member of the government's scientific advisory group (Sage), said the ""key"" to knowing if the four-week lockdown in England was working was ""if cases fall"" and they expect to know that ""in the next week"". ""As long as we see cases decline we can make judgments... about opening up,"" she said. She added that, prior to the lockdown, the ""tiering of the country"" had had a ""different effect in each area"". ""Tier three plus"" had led to a reduction in cases in the North West, she said, while tier two ""holds in some areas and not in others"", depending on ""how well individuals are taking that advice in"". However, she added: ""We see very little effect from tier one and when we look at what tiers may be there in the future, we will have to think about strengthening them to get us through the winter months until the vaccine is available for everyone."" The government is adamant that it wants England's lockdown to end on 2 December. But what replaces it is still very much a live discussion in the corridors of power. There was always a question mark about how much infections would fall during the lockdown. And clearly the impact has been undermined by the spike in cases last week when the daily number jumped by 10,000 to over 33,000 on Thursday. That rise has been linked to a last bout of socialising before the lockdown came in. The hope is cases will start falling this week. But it will take much longer for that to filter through into fewer hospital cases - hence the suggestion that the regional tiers may need to be strengthened when lockdown ends. One idea is to create a new tier four, which would see much tighter restrictions on hospitality opening. But do not expect an announcement soon. Ministers will want to see exactly what happens to cases over the rest of the month. Also speaking at the government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock, the health secretary, said it was too early to know the impact of the second lockdown in England, which began on 5 November. ""At the moment, most of the tests we're getting back, and most of the positive cases, are from around the time the lockdown came in, so we are yet to see in the data - and it's too early to expect to see in the data - the impact of the second lockdown,"" he said. ""But we absolutely hope to be able to replace the national lockdown with a tiered system similar to what we had before."" At a briefing on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are committed to setting out next week what the replacement regime will be and that will be a return to the localised approach and we're actively working on those plans at the moment."" Mr Hancock also confirmed: The UK has secured five million doses of the new Moderna vaccine- which has shown in early data that it is nearly 95% effective in protecting against Covid-19. Mr Hancock said that if it was found to be safe, it would be available in the UK in spring next year The NHS will be opening a network of 40 ""long Covid"" clinics across England, which will be in place by the end of the month Two new ""mega labs"" will open early next yearand add another 600,000 to the UK's testing capacity -  doubling the current testing capacity Before England went into its second lockdown, nearly a fifth of the population was living in tier three areas - those under the toughest coronavirus restrictions. They included those in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, the Liverpool City Region, Warrington and Nottinghamshire.

Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas'The government says it's working closely with the social care sector to roll out testing across the country.UK,"The government aims to have coronavirus testing available to allow visits in all care homes in England by Christmas, according to the health secretary. Matt Hancock said it was ""working closely with the social care sector"" to try to make it happen. It comes as a screening pilot across 20 care homes in Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall was launched on Monday. It is hoped the trial could end restrictions on visits, when used with other measures such as face coverings. Many people have seen strict restrictions placed on visits to care homes over the last eight months, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Hancock said he understood how important it was for people to be able to visit loved ones in care homes. ""Our goal is to ensure that we have the testing available in every care home by Christmas, to make sure that people can take a test and therefore see their loved ones safely,"" he told BBC Breakfast. The government issuedupdated guidance on visits to care homes,externalon 5 November when England went into its second national lockdown. This includes care homes ensuring PPE is used during visits, there are screens between the resident and any visitor and social distancing must be maintained ""at all times"". Michael Blakstad said his wife Tricia is confined to a single room at her care home due to an outbreak of the virus Michael Blakstad said the guidelines at his wife Tricia's care home was making her situation a ""nightmare"". He told Radio 4's Today programme she had been isolated in her room for the last three weeks due to an outbreak of the virus. ""She's basically got this form of dementia which means she doesn't like sitting down,"" Mr Blakstad said. ""That makes it a nightmare being in a single room - it is like being stuck in a hotel room for three weeks without being able to go out. It's just awful."" He said the only visitors she is allowed are care home staff dressed in personal protective equipment, which makes it difficult to ""form a relationship"". Care home moves had 'tragic consequences' Are care homes ready for the second wave? Locked down and lonely: 'Why doesn't anyone want us?' The health secretary said he had personal experience of how tough the coronavirus restrictions were for families with loved ones in care homes. But he told the Today programme that people in care homes are ""particularly vulnerable"" to the virus and when it gets into the facilities it ""runs rife"". ""So we both need to protect people from the virus but also do that in as a humane a way as possible, and we know the impact on people's health, let alone everything else, on not being able to see visitors."" Mr Hancock said ""protocols"" were being written alongside the current trial in care homes to allow the scheme be widened to all care homes in England. ""Describing how this can be done well with the availability of the testing, which of course is now much more widely available than it was at the start of the crisis, means that we'll be able to roll that out right across the country."" Separately to the new screening pilot, care home staff in Liverpool are being trained by soldiers in how to carry out coronavirus tests. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: this would allow staff to take the test to the care homes and delivering them to residents and their relatives ""so that people can try and at least have some visits or indeed get back to normal"".

Police 'let people down' on night of Arena bombTwenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured as they left the Ariana Grande concert in 2017.Manchester,"Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan agreed British Transport Police (BTP) had made mistakes A senior officer at British Transport Police has accepted the force let the public down on the night of the Manchester Arena attack. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan has been giving evidence to the public inquiry into the atrocity. He agreed mistakes were made, including having no officers in the foyer where bomber Salman Abedi hid before the blast which killed 22 people. Mr O'Callaghan said the attack had ""happened on [BTP's] watch"". Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more were injured as they left an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. The inquiry previously heard there wereno police officers on patrolwhen 22-year-old Abedi made his journey from Victoria Station to the City Room. BTP had primary responsibility for policing in the arena foyerÂ due to the proximity of Victoria railway station. ""The attack that happened that night happened on our watch,"" Mr O'Callaghan, who was not working for the force at the time, said. ""There is not a day that goes by when BTP doesn't consider that."" He added: ""Did we let the people down? ""It was our responsibility to police that arena and that attack happened when we were policing it, there were police officers planned to be deployed to the site of the attack and they were not there - so in that term, yes."" Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell Mr O'Callaghan agreed if BTP officers had been in the City Room at the end of the show, Abedi could have been challenged before he detonated his bomb. He acknowledged it was ""unacceptable"" two of the officers on duty had taken a two-hour break including a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab, but it would be ""right and proper"" to wait for the inquiry's findings before taking any further action. John Cooper QC, representing some of the bereaved families, said: ""You'll understand the families' concerns when at least one of them has photographs receiving commendations?"" Mr O'Callaghan said that after the bomb went off, the officers went on to perform ""extremely brave actions"". He also denied the threat of terrorism at the arena had been disregarded by BTP at the time, saying: ""The information officers had at the time was up to 100 concerts a year had been going on at the arenaâ¦there was nothing to focus the mind on people planning a policing response that a person-borne IED was plausible at that time."" Since the attack there have been a number of improvements made to police planning for events at the arena, Mr O'Callaghan told the court. This includes specific counter-terrorism briefings for officers, documented risk assessments specific to each event and more multi-agency meetings. The inquiry continues.

Concern over numbers out of full-time schoolThe BBC can reveal a spike in the number of parents taking their children out of school.Family & EducationComments,"Parents who home educate say it allows them to set a time-table that best suits their child The coronavirus pandemic could be fuelling an increase in the number of children moving out of full-time schooling, town hall bosses warn. The Local Government Association says some areas have seen significant rises in registrations for home schooling. It comes after separate LGA analysis for 2018-19 suggested between 250,000 and a million children in England were out of full-time school. The government says school is the best place for the majority of children. A lack of oversight on how and why pupils leave, and where they end up, makes tracking them difficult. There are no official figures for children who are missing out on school, and the issue has been a challenge for successive education departments which do not track it centrally. Depending on how ""missing school"" is defined, the LGA, which represents councils in England. estimates the number could be around 280,000. But if the point at which councils are formally required to provide tuition for sick pupils - 15 days absence - was adopted as a measure, children out of school would number one million. The LGA began looking into how many children were out of full-time school before coronavirus hit the UK. But there are concerns that the pandemic continues to push numbers up, and that the closure of schools and extreme pressure on support systems for special needs and mental health issues, make its findings even more worrying. The LGA says that between September 2019 and September 2020, some local authorities, saw huge rises in registrations for elective home education. For example, in Kent the figure rose by almost 200%, and in Leeds by almost 150%. It is calling for more funds to enable schools to support children and more powers to keep an eye on them if their parents do take them out of school. Judith Blake, chair of the LGA's children and young people board, says the rising numbers of children not in education are hugely concerning. ""It is hard to tackle due a lack of council powers and resources, and flaws in an education framework ill-suited to an inclusive agenda. ""Children are arriving in schools with a combination of needs, often linked to disruption in their family lives, at a time when schools' capacity to respond is stretched to capacity."" Ms Blake says while parents, councils and schools all have responsibilities to ensure children receive suitable education, significant gaps in the law mean it is possible for children to slip through the net and face serious risks. These include safeguarding issues, gangs and criminality, serious under-achievement and damaged future prospects. ""The pandemic is only likely to increase these risks and add to the significant lifetime costs to the public purse of a young person not in education, employment or training,"" she says. There have always been a small proportion of parents who, for a variety of philosophical, cultural, lifestyle or religious reasons, decide to educate their children themselves, at home. This is a right, set out in law, which parents are free to exercise. Philosophical or life-choices remain the most commonly cited reasons but research for the LGA suggests health or emotional reasons are the fastest growing factors. Some parents make the decision because they are frustrated with ""zero tolerance"" behaviour policies, their children's refusal to attend or a lack of understanding of their child's particular needs, the report says. The LGA is keen to stress that not all the children who are taken out of school at the instigation of their parents end up missing out on their entitlement to education, and acknowledges that many parents provide an excellent home education. It argues, however, that children are more likely to miss out on education if their parents remove them out of desperation because they feel the school is not meeting their child's needs, or out of fear and hostility towards safeguarding or development interventions. The report concludes: ""Many have said that the world after lock-down might never be the same again. ""If that is the case, we should use this period of reflection to determine how we reconnect our education system going forward in a way that we can be confident that all children can access their entitlement to a formal, full-time education."" In a statement, the Department for Education said: ""For the vast majority of children, particularly the most vulnerable, school is the best place for their education. ""Home education is never a decision that should be entered into lightly, and now more than ever, it is absolutely vital that any decision to home educate is made with the child's best interests at the forefront of everyone's minds.

Concern over numbers out of full-time school,"Parents who home educate say it allows them to set a time-table that best suits their child The coronavirus pandemic could be fuelling an increase in the number of children moving out of full-time schooling, town hall bosses warn. The Local Government Association says some areas have seen significant rises in registrations for home schooling. It comes after separate LGA analysis for 2018-19 suggested between 250,000 and a million children in England were out of full-time school. The government says school is the best place for the majority of children. A lack of oversight on how and why pupils leave, and where they end up, makes tracking them difficult. There are no official figures for children who are missing out on school, and the issue has been a challenge for successive education departments which do not track it centrally. Depending on how ""missing school"" is defined, the LGA, which represents councils in England. estimates the number could be around 280,000. But if the point at which councils are formally required to provide tuition for sick pupils - 15 days absence - was adopted as a measure, children out of school would number one million. The LGA began looking into how many children were out of full-time school before coronavirus hit the UK. But there are concerns that the pandemic continues to push numbers up, and that the closure of schools and extreme pressure on support systems for special needs and mental health issues, make its findings even more worrying. The LGA says that between September 2019 and September 2020, some local authorities, saw huge rises in registrations for elective home education. For example, in Kent the figure rose by almost 200%, and in Leeds by almost 150%.

Further NI Covid restrictions 'needed mid-December',"Christmas lights were switched on at Belfast City Hall on Saturday, but without the crowds usually in attendance, due to the virus The executive will do all it can to ""protect"" as much of the Christmas period as possible, Michelle O'Neill has said. It comes after NI's chief scientific adviser warned further Covid-19 restrictions will likely be recommended before Christmas. Prof Ian Young said mid-December could be the ""big risk period"". The deputy first minister said it was difficult to provide certainty but she wanted to give people ""some comfort"". The executive's ""clear commitment"" was to secure that, she added. Some of the current Covid-19 restrictions are due to end on Friday with the reopening of close-contact services and unlicensed hospitality businesses. That decision was taken by ministers on Thursday, followingfour days of heated disagreements and delay. Prof Young has warned that Christmas ""cannot be completely normal"" as allowing people to interact will increase the risks. ""There would be an option of measures which the executive would need to consider and I think everybody is familiar with what those restrictions look like,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""They have to minimise the interactions between people, particularly in indoor settings, in order to reduce transmission of the virus as much as possible."" His warning came theDepartment of Health recorded a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths,external, bringing the death toll to 869. A further 331 positive cases have been reported in the last 24 hours. In the Republic of Ireland five further coronavirus-related deaths and 456 new cases were recorded on Monday. The Irish Department of Health said there were 33 people in ICU, two more than Sunday. Speaking in the assembly on Monday, Ms O'Neill said the executive wanted to be able to ""give people something, in terms of being able to spend some time with family members"". ""It will be dependent of the virus spread at the time... we should be able to give people a bit of flexibility to allow people to get over the Christmas period,"" she said. The deputy first minister said the R-number - or reproduction value of the virus - in Northern Ireland was now at 0.9, and ""perhaps going towards one"". Any decisions about the Christmas period would have to be taken on the basis of health advice, she said. Addressing the criticism directed at ministers over the delay in agreeing restrictions, Ms O'Neill said the executive needed to ""collectively get a grip"". The deputy first minister said it was a ""matter of profound concern and regret"" that the DUP had blocked health proposals by triggering a cross-community vote. It can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis. It effectively gives parties with enough ministers a veto. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance had voted to extend the restrictions - but the DUP's decision to deploy the cross-community mechanism meant the plan was blocked. ""It should have been the will of the executive which carried it through, but I accept this is now the outworking of the executive, and we're all duty-bound to communicate the decision to the public,"" she added First Minister Arlene Foster defended her party's decision to use the veto. ""We all know those who want to apportion blame and the use of vetoes, but the truth is we should never have gotten to that point,"" she told the assembly on Monday. ""I hope in our discussions in the coming days, which again will be difficult, which again will be controversial, I hope we can get to a point without invoking all of that."" In other coronavirus-related developments on Monday: TheCovid-19 self-isolation grant,externaldaily allowance is being increased and the number of days for which an award can be made is being extended Kidneytransplant operations have been suspended in Northern Irelandbecause of the extra pressure Covid-19 is placing on the health service NI's chief medical officer has urged people tolook after their mental health and wellbeingthis winter The Department of Health has placed a Â£15m order with Limavady-based Paragon Health for face masks for health workers. Prof Young was also asked about schools closing early for Christmas When asked about schools closing early for Christmas, Prof Young said keeping schools open was a top priority for the executive. However, he said ""opening schools will tend to increase the transmission of the virus in the community"". ""Less because of what happens in schools and more because of what happens outside schools as people interact in different ways,"" he said. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, saidcomments by the health ministerand chief scientific adviser on the possibility of further restrictions has a ""damaging and demoralising"" effect on business owners and staff. ""It makes them worry about whether or not the new dates they've been told when they can reopen will actually happen,"" he said. Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has rejected accusations that not enough planning was done to manage a winter surge of Covid-19 in NI. He said the health service had been ready, but he could ""never have planned for scientific and medical advice given to the executive being blocked"". Mr Swann was answering an urgent question in the assembly from the DUP about his assessment of whether the surge planning framework had worked, in light of ""hospitals across Northern Ireland operating at over capacity"".

Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

I'm pregnant - is vaccine safe? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

Good ventilation could be key this winter,"With social distancing restrictions ending in England and easing further in Scotland on 19 July, good ventilation will remain very important in avoiding Covid. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat the virus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According toworkplace regulations set up before the pandemic,external, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, saysDr Hywel Davies,external, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. A split air conditioner In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. Astudy of a restaurant in China,externalblamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. A rooftop air conditioning unit There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections. Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences."" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

Why does Johnson have to isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious.

WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well.

Will there be more than one vaccine?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

world today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our
teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Sophie Williams, Alice
Evans, Alexandra Fouche, Becky Morton, Max Matza and Doug Faulkner, and the
editors were Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis and Sarah Fowler We'll be pausing our live coverage for the evening shortly so here's a quick summary of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today:  No traces of coroanvirus have been found on trains used by Britain's largest rail franchise, it has said. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said checks on a random selection of carriages used by its Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern brands all returned negative results. The tests were carried out up to 23 days after surfaces frequently touched by passengers and staff were treated with an anti-viral disinfectant. The surfaces included grab rails, tables, toilet handles and door buttons. As well as long-lasting disinfectant, all 2,700 GTR carriages are sanitised overnight using short-term anti-viral sprays and an additional 100 cleaners have been deployed. A further 213 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19,according to figures from the UK government,external, bringing the country's total death toll to 52,147. And 21,363 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the past day. There have been 1,390,681 cases reported in the UK in total. Last week the UK became the first country in Europeto reach the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at the briefing about advice from the government modelling group SPI-M that suggested returning to the three-tiered system in December risked the R value rising again, and undoing any decline in the rate of new cases achieved during England's lockdown. Hancock responded that that was not what the scientific advice had said - that it wasnât just about the tiered system but âalso about what measures are in each tierâ. You can read the SPI-M advicehere,external. It says that what happens to the outbreak depends on what measures are taken after 2 December and that: âIf England returns to the same application of the tiering system in place before 5 November, then transmission will return to the same rate of increase as today.â But clearly that allows for the government to introduce a different application of the tiering system, having different restrictions in each of the tiers than it had before the second lockdown. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The head of the World Health Organization has warned against complacency in the fight against Covid-19, despite the news that some potential vaccines are showing very good results in testing. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus was surging in many parts of the world, and said countries letting it spread unchecked were playing with fire. The news that two vaccines being tested have shown a success rate of 90% or more have sent stock markets soaring, and sighs of relief rippling through governments. But today the WHO offered a reality check: it is likely to be months before vaccines are widely available, in the meantime Covid-19 is surging across Europe and North America. For now, there is no alternative to laborious testing, tracing and isolating. The WHO also wants to ensure vaccines are fairly distributed and has called on G20 leaders to commit to provide vaccines to poorer countries. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government is adamant that it wants Englandâs lockdown
to end on 2 December. But what replaces it is still very much a live discussion in
the corridors of power. There was always a question mark about how much infections
would fall during the lockdown. And clearly the impact has been undermined by the spike in
cases last week, when the daily number jumped by 10,000 to over 33,000 on
Thursday. That rise has been linked to a last bout of socialising
before the lockdown came in. The hope is cases will start falling this week. But it will take much longer for that to filter through into
fewer hospital cases. Hence the suggestion that the regional tiers may need to be
strengthened when lockdown ends. One idea is to create a new tier four, which would see much
tighter restrictions on hospitality opening. But do not expect an announcement soon. Ministers will want
to see exactly what happens to cases over the rest of the month. Dr Scott Atlas was accused of inciting political violence Dr Scott Atlas - a controversial radiologist, member of the White House coronavirus taskforce and a skeptic of virus mitigation efforts such as mask- wearing - has clarified a tweet from yesterday condemning the Michigan's governor's newest lockdown order. In his tweet, he objected to the Democratic governor's order to close many businesses and schools for three weeks amid a surge in new Covid cases. ""The only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept,"" he wrote. The Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was the subject of an alleged kidnapping attempt last month by militia members opposed to virus mitigation efforts. Michigan's state house has also been the scene of several major protests, including one where gun-carrying protesters attempted to storm the legislature. Amid an online backlash, Atlas responded: ""Hey. I NEVER was talking at all about violence. People vote, people peacefully protest. NEVER would I endorse or incite violence. NEVER!!"" Social distancing and mask wearing are recommended by health agencies around the world, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a way to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.

a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the
latest vaccine news has led to a resurgence. One false claim circulating is that a vaccine is a means of inserting
microchips into the population. Other popular, unsubstantiated
claims include the idea that a vaccine will be used to alter our DNA or even as
a weapon of genocide.Reality Check has debunked these claims. This kind of disinformation is a
world away from legitimate concerns about whether a vaccine is safe and
properly tested - concerns that were previously
raised in the US, for example, over fears that vaccine approvals could be rushed
through. Despite commitments to tackle
falsehoods from social media sites and the government, the constant swirl of
conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective
vaccine. The anti-vaccine movement, of course, pre-dates the pandemic -
perhaps because vaccinations have always involved a combination of science that
is difficult to understand, and emotive reactions, including worry, excitement,
and anxiety about being jabbed by a needle. But it is not the only thing responsible for the latest spread of
these conspiracy theories online. Pseudo-science figures with large
online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking
coronavirus to 5G  - have also turned their attention to vaccines. Have you seen suspect posts about
vaccines on your social media feeds? Get in touch -marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Jamie Kaffash, from primary care publication Pulse magazine, asks Matt Hancock if he can reassure GPs he will reduce their non-urgent workload to free up time for the Covid vaccination programme. The health secretary tells every GP that he is very grateful for the work they are doing on flu vaccines and on the ""normal pressures of primary care"". He says he hopes  a Covid vaccination programme will be ready to go, with 1 December the earliest the roll-out could begin. Jonathan Van-Tam says the roll-out is ""going to be biggest and most important thing NHS has done for a very long time"". He says he understands workload pressures but says it will be ""incumbent on all of us"" to make sure this programme moves as fast as it can with highest uptake possible. ""It is a big opportunity to change the way the pandemic will roll out over 2021,"" he says. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will England come out of lockdown on December 2nd?
Boris Johnsonâs always been keen to emphasize that the rules legally expire on
that date. But Matt Hancock strikes a more cautious note, saying itâs too early
to be sure although itâs his âhopeâ that it will be time to go back into the
tiered system. This is a question that will need to be answered soon; MPs have
been told theyâll get a vote on what happens next before the month-long
lockdown is up. A journalist from the Independent asks Matt Hancock whether NHS staff are going to get an above-inflation pay rise. In reply, the health secretary says the government has already agreed a three-year pay deal for nurses. He says an independent pay review of NHS wages is ongoing - and he is ""not going to prejudge"" the results of that. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent It looks like some fervent
negotiations have been going on behind the scenes. Just a few hours ago, the government said it
was in advanced discussions with Moderna to gain access to the vaccine. Now
Matt Hancock has announced a preliminary deal for 5 million doses. Some Tory
MPs think ministers like Matt Hancock have pinned too much, in terms of their Covid
strategy, on the prospect of a vaccine but of course early results from Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna have raised many peopleâs
hopes that this could be crucial in helping the country emerge from
restrictions. Gordon Rayner from the Daily Telegraph asks if the 14-day isolation period may be reconsidered, particularly in light of the prime minister isolating despite ""bursting with antibodies"". Hancock says the prime minister going into self-isolation is a clear demonstration that everybody, no matter who you are, needs to follow the rules. He says they keep such things under review but are not in a position to make any changes. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock has
mentioned two new coronavirus testing âmega labsâ which he said could increase
testing capacity by 600,000 tests a day. But capacity does not mean actually
processing that many tests, just that there is the ability â in theory - to do
that many. For example, on 12 November, there was UK
lab capacity for 520,000 tests, but in reality 380,000 tests were processed. This means labs were running at about 73%
of capacity. The government says on an ideal day they will be working at 85% of capacity, to allow some room if there is a surge
in demand for tests.  There's another question from a journalist from Channel 5 about what measures could replace the England-wide lockdown in December, and whether a return to local tiers could increase infections. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says the tiered restrictions have had a ""different effect"" in each area. She says there is evidence that in tier two - the middle tier - restrictions ""hold in some areas, not so well in others"". She says the rules in tier one - the lowest Covid alert level - have had ""very little effect"" and may need to be ""strengthened"" to help the country ""get through the winter months"". Sky's Thomas Moore asks why the UK government has not bought up some of the Moderna vaccine before now. Matt Hancock says there is not a stockpile, the vaccine has not yet been manufactured and in Europe first availability will be in the spring. ""It is critical we have been buying the first vaccines that will be available,"" he says. He adds that, if you take the Astrazeneca agreements and Pfizer vaccines into account, the UK has more than 100 million doses on order. Jonathan Van-Tam says the spiked coronavirus protein is being targeted by most of the vaccine trials around the world and these early results are beginning to show us this is a ""plausible target for vaccines to be working against"". ""When we started this journey in February/March we didn't even know that, so we are in a happier place than we were,"" he says. BBC Medical Editor Fergus Walsh asks Matt Hancock if he ""regrets"" the UK has not signed a deal for more Moderna vaccine. The health secretary says this vaccine won't come in until the spring - but the UK has already got 40 million of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines on order, and they are likely to come on stream earlier. He adds though that neither is currently approved. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the UK has purchased vaccines across ""multiple targets"". Reaching for a football metaphor, he says that positive news on Moderna, following the encouraging news earlier this month from Pfizer, is the ""second penalty that has gone into the back of the net"". Diviya from Leicester asks if the national lockdown in England will be extended beyond 2 December if cases and deaths continue to rise. Matt Hancock says it is too early for us to know what the number of cases will be at the end of the current lockdown. He says: ""At the moment most of the tests we are getting back, most of the positive cases, are from around the time when the lockdown came in so it is too early to see in the data the impact of the second lockdown. ""But we absolutely hope to be able to replace the national lockdown with a tiered system similar to the one we had before."" But he says that is still being assessed. Â© 2025 BBC.

Hungary and Poland block EU Covid-recovery fundThe two countries object to a clause that links funding with adherence to the rule of law.Europe,"Hungary and Poland have blocked approval of the EU's budget over a clause that ties funding with adherence to the rule of law in the bloc. The package includes â¬750bn (Â£673bn; $888bn) for a Covid recovery fund. Ambassadors of the 27 member states meeting in Brussels were unable to endorse the budget because the two countries vetoed it. Hungary and Poland have been criticised for violating democratic standards enshrined in the EU's founding treaty. The EU is currently investigating both countries for undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations. The clause threatens to cost them billions of euros in EU funding. EU states had already agreed on the â¬1.1tn budget for 2021-2027, and the coronavirus stimulus package after a marathon four-day summit in July. This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel, speaking in July, said the post-virus recovery package was a ""pivotal moment"" The ambassadors had voted through the clause that made access to EU funds conditional on adherence to the rule of law, because it only required a qualified majority, the German EU presidency said. But the budget and the rescue package needed unanimous support and were then blocked by Poland and Hungary. This is a row that's come to a head after simmering for the past four months. It was back in July, when EU leaders first agreed to club together and raise almost â¬2tn to spend over the next seven years, as they try to recover from the financial crisis caused by Covid. At the time, the agreement was hailed as a ""magic moment"" by the EU Council President Charles Michel, who said it was ""unprecedented"", because access to cash would be conditional on countries following the rule of law. But Hungary and Poland haven't viewed the arrangement that way, and both countries have long been at loggerheads with the EU over perceived backsliding of core values. On Monday, they refused to support the plan. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n had sent a note in advance of the meeting, to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, making clear his intention, claiming the rule of law clause ""jeopardises trust"" between member states. Final approval needs unanimity, and now the entire process hangs in the balance, with other member states making it clear they desperately need access to the money come January. ""We cannot support the plan in its present form to tie rule of law criteria to budget decisions,"" said Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Polish judge suspended in row over court shake-up Hungary 'broke EU law' by forcing out university Why fractious EU still believes together is better Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki threatened a veto last week. On Monday, Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the rule of law issue was ""just a pretext"". ""It is really an institutional, political enslavement, a radical limitation of sovereignty,"" he said. But Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, addressing a conference shortly after the budget was blocked, said that ""upholding the principles of the rule of law is an absolute necessity"" because the sums being handed out by the EU to member states were so vast. Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said the rule-of-law clause was an important protection to ensure taxpayer's money is ""spent in a just and effective manner"". He called on EU states ""to work together"" adding: ""We need to refocus and get this agreement done."" German ambassador Michael Clauss, who chaired the meeting, warned that the EU would face ""a serious crisis"" if the financial package was not quickly adopted. ""We have already lost a lot of time in view of the second pandemic wave and the severe economic damage,"" he said. The pandemic has caused economic hardship across Europe, like here in Madrid where people queued for food donations In a tweet, Johannes Hahn, EU-Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said he was ""disappointed"" by the veto. He urged member states to ""assume political responsibility and take the necessary steps to finalise the entire package"". ""This is not about ideologies but about help for our citizens in the worst crisis since World War Two,"" he added. The impasse will be debated by EU European affairs ministers on Tuesday and by EU leaders in a video-conference on Thursday. However, officials say a solution might take longer to find.

Ambassadors of the 27 member states meeting in Brussels were unable to endorse the budget because the two countries vetoed it. Hungary and Poland have been criticised for violating democratic standards enshrined in the EU's founding treaty. The EU is currently investigating both countries for undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations. The clause threatens to cost them billions of euros in EU funding. EU states had already agreed on the â¬1.1tn budget for 2021-2027, and the coronavirus stimulus package after a marathon four-day summit in July. This video can not be played European Council President Charles Michel, speaking in July, said the post-virus recovery package was a ""pivotal moment"" The ambassadors had voted through the clause that made access to EU funds conditional on adherence to the rule of law, because it only required a qualified majority, the German EU presidency said. But the budget and the rescue package needed unanimous support and were then blocked by Poland and Hungary. This is a row that's come to a head after simmering for the past four months. It was back in July, when EU leaders first agreed to club together and raise almost â¬2tn to spend over the next seven years, as they try to recover from the financial crisis caused by Covid. At the time, the agreement was hailed as a ""magic moment"" by the EU Council President Charles Michel, who said it was ""unprecedented"", because access to cash would be conditional on countries following the rule of law. But Hungary and Poland haven't viewed the arrangement that way, and both countries have long been at loggerheads with the EU over perceived backsliding of core values. On Monday, they refused to support the plan. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n had sent a note in advance of the meeting, to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, making clear his intention, claiming the rule of law clause ""jeopardises trust"" between member states. Final approval needs unanimity, and now the entire process hangs in the balance, with other member states making it clear they desperately need access to the money come January. ""We cannot support the plan in its present form to tie rule of law criteria to budget decisions,"" said Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Polish judge suspended in row over court shake-up Hungary 'broke EU law' by forcing out university Why fractious EU still believes together is better Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki threatened a veto last week. On Monday, Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the rule of law issue was ""just a pretext"". ""It is really an institutional, political enslavement, a radical limitation of sovereignty,"" he said. But Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, addressing a conference shortly after the budget was blocked, said that ""upholding the principles of the rule of law is an absolute necessity"" because the sums being handed out by the EU to member states were so vast. Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said the rule-of-law clause was an important protection to ensure taxpayer's money is ""spent in a just and effective manner"". He called on EU states ""to work together"" adding: ""We need to refocus and get this agreement done."" German ambassador Michael Clauss, who chaired the meeting, warned that the EU would face ""a serious crisis"" if the financial package was not quickly adopted. ""We have already lost a lot of time in view of the second pandemic wave and the severe economic damage,"" he said. The pandemic has caused economic hardship across Europe, like here in Madrid where people queued for food donations In a tweet, Johannes Hahn, EU-Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said he was ""disappointed"" by the veto. He urged member states to ""assume political responsibility and take the necessary steps to finalise the entire package"". ""This is not about ideologies but about help for our citizens in the worst crisis since World War Two,"" he added. The impasse will be debated by EU European affairs ministers on Tuesday and by EU leaders in a video-conference on Thursday. However, officials say a solution might take longer to find.

Street Fighter firm's security beaten by hackers,"Capcom is best known for franchises such as Street Fighter Video-game-maker Capcom has warned a ransomware attack might have compromised gamers' personal information. Up to 350,000 people could be affected,external, it said, and some of its own financial information had been stolen. The Japanese developer is best known for franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter. A week-and-a-half earlier, it had said there was no indication customer information had been accessed. But in an update on Monday, Capcom confirmed its servers had been hit by an attack on 2 November. Ransomware is malicious software that typically threatens to block a victim's access to their own records unless a blackmail payment is made. In this case, the attackers digitally scrambled some of the data on Capcom's servers, making it impossible to view or amend, and destroyed some files outright. The Ragnar Locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption involved, Capcom said. On Ragnor Locker's dark-net webpage, the hackers didn't just post Capcom's data but also an ominous message. In broken English they wrote the Japanese company didn't ""make a right decision and save data from leakage"". This - and the fact Capcom is openly talking about the hack - suggests the company chose not to pay the cyber-criminals' extortion demand. Many, including law enforcement, would actually see this as absolutely the right decision. For 18 months, police the world over have been desperately imploring ransomware victims not to pay hackers. The groups have made millions from companies, which often feel they have no other option but to fork out. But it seems Capcom has found a way through without yielding. No doubt the incident has affected the firm's reputation and some sensitive data is already surfacing online. But reading the disappointment in Ragnor Locker's statement is refreshing and rare. So far, Capcom has confirmed only nine people's personal information was definitely compromised, all current or former employees. But up to 350,000 customers, business partners, and other employees might also be affected, it said. Although, it could not be sure because its own logs had been ""lost as a result of the attack"". Resident Evil-maker hit in latest gaming hack Game firms targeted as part of global hacking plot The information includes different combinations of names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and email addresses, depending on why the data was gathered. For example, some was from Japanese customer support and some from the American Capcom store or e-sports operation. ""None of the at-risk data contains credit-card information,"" Capcom's statement said. ""All online transactions... are handled by a third-party service provider. ""And as such, Capcom does not maintain any such information internally."" The company also said it was safe for gamers to continue to play its games online and to use its websites. Police have been notified, as have the Japanese and UK data-protection watchdogs. ""Capcom would once again like to reiterate its deepest apologies for any complications or concerns caused by this incident,"" it said. ""As a company that handles digital content, it is regarding this incident with the utmost seriousness.""

Concern over numbers out of full-time schoolThe BBC can reveal a spike in the number of parents taking their children out of school.Family & Education,"Parents who home educate say it allows them to set a time-table that best suits their child The coronavirus pandemic could be fuelling an increase in the number of children moving out of full-time schooling, town hall bosses warn. The Local Government Association says some areas have seen significant rises in registrations for home schooling. It comes after separate LGA analysis for 2018-19 suggested between 250,000 and a million children in England were out of full-time school. The government says school is the best place for the majority of children. A lack of oversight on how and why pupils leave, and where they end up, makes tracking them difficult. There are no official figures for children who are missing out on school, and the issue has been a challenge for successive education departments which do not track it centrally. Depending on how ""missing school"" is defined, the LGA, which represents councils in England. estimates the number could be around 280,000. But if the point at which councils are formally required to provide tuition for sick pupils - 15 days absence - was adopted as a measure, children out of school would number one million. The LGA began looking into how many children were out of full-time school before coronavirus hit the UK. But there are concerns that the pandemic continues to push numbers up, and that the closure of schools and extreme pressure on support systems for special needs and mental health issues, make its findings even more worrying. The LGA says that between September 2019 and September 2020, some local authorities, saw huge rises in registrations for elective home education. For example, in Kent the figure rose by almost 200%, and in Leeds by almost 150%. It is calling for more funds to enable schools to support children and more powers to keep an eye on them if their parents do take them out of school. Judith Blake, chair of the LGA's children and young people board, says the rising numbers of children not in education are hugely concerning. ""It is hard to tackle due a lack of council powers and resources, and flaws in an education framework ill-suited to an inclusive agenda. ""Children are arriving in schools with a combination of needs, often linked to disruption in their family lives, at a time when schools' capacity to respond is stretched to capacity."" Ms Blake says while parents, councils and schools all have responsibilities to ensure children receive suitable education, significant gaps in the law mean it is possible for children to slip through the net and face serious risks. These include safeguarding issues, gangs and criminality, serious under-achievement and damaged future prospects. ""The pandemic is only likely to increase these risks and add to the significant lifetime costs to the public purse of a young person not in education, employment or training,"" she says. There have always been a small proportion of parents who, for a variety of philosophical, cultural, lifestyle or religious reasons, decide to educate their children themselves, at home. This is a right, set out in law, which parents are free to exercise. Philosophical or life-choices remain the most commonly cited reasons but research for the LGA suggests health or emotional reasons are the fastest growing factors. Some parents make the decision because they are frustrated with ""zero tolerance"" behaviour policies, their children's refusal to attend or a lack of understanding of their child's particular needs, the report says. The LGA is keen to stress that not all the children who are taken out of school at the instigation of their parents end up missing out on their entitlement to education, and acknowledges that many parents provide an excellent home education. It argues, however, that children are more likely to miss out on education if their parents remove them out of desperation because they feel the school is not meeting their child's needs, or out of fear and hostility towards safeguarding or development interventions. The report concludes: ""Many have said that the world after lock-down might never be the same again. ""If that is the case, we should use this period of reflection to determine how we reconnect our education system going forward in a way that we can be confident that all children can access their entitlement to a formal, full-time education."" In a statement, the Department for Education said: ""For the vast majority of children, particularly the most vulnerable, school is the best place for their education. ""Home education is never a decision that should be entered into lightly, and now more than ever, it is absolutely vital that any decision to home educate is made with the child's best interests at the forefront of everyone's minds. ""Any parents who are considering home education on the grounds of safety concerns should make every effort to engage with their school and think very carefully about what is best for their children's education. ""The protective measures in place make schools as safe as possible for children and staff, and schools are not the main drivers of infection in the community.""

Flu vaccine shortage in NI is 'deeply concerning',"The Public Health Agency said uptake of the vaccine has been higher than ever before. There is ""no shortage"" of ordered flu vaccines for Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. NI's GP committee had said that Northern Ireland was almost 200,000 doses short of the flu vaccine. The chair of NI's GP committee had raised concerns that it would not be possible to complete the vaccination programme for those aged over 65. But the Public Health Agency (PHA) now says that this is not the case. Concerns about a shortage of flu vaccine initially emerged after a meeting of GPs and Public Health Agency representatives last week. Dr Alan Stout, chair of NI's GP committee (NIGPC), then wrote to GPs across Northern Ireland and said he was ""deeply concerned and frustrated"" about a shortfall in flu vaccines. The BBC has also learned that after last week's meeting,  Dr Stout wrote to the chief medical officer highlighting their concerns over the shortfall of about 200,000 vaccine doses. In an email to Dr Michael McBride and seen by BBC News NI Dr Alan Stout said: ""You will see that it is far from satisfactory and puts practices in a very difficult situation and really does put at risk the completion of the flu campaign this year. ""Is this all consistent with your own understanding? ""We have a large number of practices with significant numbers of patients still to be vaccinated. We need to get advice to them ASAP about when they can do this and what vaccine they should give. "" But on Monday Dr Gerry Waldron from the PHA said there was not a shortage and he hoped the confusion would not deter those coming forward. Later on Monday Robin Swann also denied there was a shortage and said Northern Ireland had ordered in total 1,050,300 doses for this year. As of last Friday, 826,890 doses had been delivered into Northern Ireland, with 601,243 doses delivered to GPs and health trusts. Flu vaccine clinics 'frantically cancelled' NI to 'pause' flu vaccinations for under-65s Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Mr Swann said two further deliveries had arrived in NI on Monday morning, with the total amount of vaccine delivered now standing at 1,019,590 doses. Thirty thousand doses of childhood vaccine still to be delivered are the ""only remaining order outstanding"", he told the assembly. From the outside looking in, things appear a bit of a mess. Here are two reputable bodies - the Public Health Agency and the NI GP committee - each with their own versions of an important meeting last week. On the one hand GPs have said they were left in no doubt of the shortfall; on Sunday the Public Health Agency confirmed in a statement that postponing clinics would ""inconvenience"" GPs. At no point did the PHA challenge or contradict what GPs had told the BBC. Twenty-four hours on, however, and it is an entirely different story with the PHA adamant that Northern Ireland now has enough vaccine to go around. The British Medical Association has reacted saying it is ""delighted"" with the news. All of this highlights the importance of clear messaging, especially during a pandemic. Communication between health officials and those on the ground needs to be accurate and up to date. All of that will go some way in reassuring the public that when it comes to vaccines, those charged with obtaining and delivering them are in complete control of everything that is going on. The PHA's Dr Gerry Waldron said for those aged over 65, about 296,000 vaccines are in Northern Ireland and this is ""the full amount that was planned"". ""It was always anticipated that stock would arrive in planned batches, and with the initial batch of vaccine for under-65s used up extremely quickly, the decision to pause was purely practical, as it was simply not possible to continue to vaccinate until the next planned tranche of vaccine became available,"" Dr Waldron said. There are two different flu vaccines available for different age groups Following the clarification from Mr Swann and the PHA, Dr Stout said: ""As of 8am when practices opened this morning they did not know that there was additional flu vaccine available in Northern Ireland. ""We've only found that out during the course of the day and the only communication that I have got on that is through the press and through the media. ""It is a good thing that we now know that it is here, but this is part of the confusion, this is part of the problem.""

The baby stealers,"Babiesare being stolen to order in Kenya to feed a thriving black market.In a year-long investigation, BBCAfrica Eye infiltrated the trafficking ringssellingchildrenfor as little as Â£300. Rebecca's son was snatched in the night. ""I hope one day he will come back,"" she said Somewhere, Rebecca's son is 10. He could be in Nairobi, where she lives, or he could be somewhere else. He could, she knows in her heart, be dead. The last time she saw him, Lawrence Josiah, her firstborn son, he was one. She was 16. It was about 2am one night in March 2011 and Rebecca was drowsy from sniffing a handkerchief doused in jet fuel â a cheap high on the city's streets. She sniffed jet fuel because it gave her the confidence to go up to strangers and beg. By the time Rebecca was 15, her mother could no longer support her or pay her school fees and she dropped out and slid into life on the street. She met an older man who promised to marry her but instead made her pregnant and left. The following year Lawrence Josiah was born, and Rebecca raised him for a year and a few months until she closed her eyes that night and never saw him again. ""Even though I have other kids, he was my firstborn, he made me a mother,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I have searched in every children's centre, in Kiambu, Kayole, and I have never found him."" Rebecca still lives on the same streets in Nairobi. She is small, with sharp cheekbones and short, tightly braided hair. She has three more children now â girls aged eight, six, and four. The youngest girl was grabbed once, she said, by a man who'd been hanging around the area, and claimed the barely one-year-old girl had asked him to buy her a drink. Rebecca followed him to a car afterwards, she said, where a woman was waiting. The next day, he was back. Rebecca and her youngest girl. ""You have to be alert,"" she said. ""The rich people will steal your baby as you sleep"" You do not have to look hard to find similar stories around the streets where Rebecca lives, alongside other unhoused Nairobi residents. Esther's three-year-old son disappeared in August 2018. ""I have never been at peace since I lost my child,"" she said. ""I have searched for him all the way to Mombasa."" It's been five years since Carol's two-year-old son was snatched in the middle of the night. ""I loved him so much,"" she said. ""I would forgive them if they would just give me back my child."" Vulnerable women are being preyed on in Nairobi to feed a thriving black market for babies. Over the course of a year-long investigation, Africa Eye has found evidence of children being snatched from homeless mothers and sold for massive profits. We uncovered illegal child trafficking in street clinics and babies being stolen to order at a major government-run hospital. And in an effort to expose those abusing government positions, we arranged to purchase an abandoned child from a hospital official, who used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week old boy before selling him directly to us. The baby-stealers range from vulnerable opportunists to organised criminals â often both elements working together. Among the opportunists are women like Anita, a heavy drinker and drug user who herself lives on and off the street, and makes money stealing children from women like Rebecca â targeting mothers with infants under the age of three. Africa Eye found out about Anita through a friend of hers, who wanted to remain anonymous. The friend, who asked to be called Emma, said Anita had different methods for snatching children on the street. ""Sometimes she will speak to the mother first, to try and see if the mother knows what she plans to do,"" Emma said. ""Sometimes she will drug the mother, give her sleeping pills or glue. Sometimes she will play with the kid. ""Anita has a lot of ways to get kids."" Emma helped expose a woman she knew stealing babies from unsuspecting street mothers Posing as potential buyers, Africa Eye set up a meeting with Anita in a pub in downtown Nairobi frequented by street sellers. Anita told us she was under pressure from her boss to steal more children, and she described a recent abduction. ""The mother was new to the streets, she seemed to be confused, not aware of what was going on,"" she said. ""She trusted me with her child. Now I have the child."" Anita said her boss was a local businesswoman who bought stolen babies from petty criminals and sold them for a profit. Some of the customers were ""women who are barren, so for them this is a kind of adoption,"" she said, but ""some use them for sacrifices"". ""Yes, they are used for sacrifices. These children just disappear from the streets and they are never seen again."" That dark hint echoed something Emma had already told us, that Anita said some buyers ""take the kids for rituals"". In reality, once Anita has sold a child on, she knows little about its fate. She charges the businesswoman 50,000 shillings for a girl or 80,000 shillings for a boy, she said â Â£350 or Â£550. That is roughly the going rate in Nairobi to steal a child from a woman on the street. ""The businesswoman, she never says the business she does with the kids,"" Emma said. ""I asked Anita does she know what the woman does with them, and she told me she could not care less whether she takes them to witchcraft or whatever. As long as she has money, she does not ask."" Soon after the first meeting, Anita called to arrange another. When we arrived, she was sitting with a baby girl who she said was five months old and she had just snatched moments before, after winning the mother's trust. ""She gave it to me for a second and I ran away with it,"" she said. Anita said she had a buyer lined up to purchase the girl for 50,000 shillings. Emma, our source, attempted to intervene, saying she had been introduced to a buyer who could pay 80,000. ""That is good,"" Anita said. ""Let's seal the deal up for tomorrow."" This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings A meeting was set for 5pm. Because a child's life was in danger, Africa Eye informed the police, who set up a sting operation to arrest Anita and rescue the child, once our buyer had met her. It was likely to be the last opportunity to secure this baby girl before she disappeared. But Anita never showed up, and despite trying for days we were unable to find her. Weeks later, Emma finally tracked her down. She told us Anita said she had found a higher bidder and used the money to build a two-room, tin-sheet house in one of the city's slums. The child was gone. The police still have an open file on Anita. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in Kenya â no government reports, no comprehensive national surveys. The agencies responsible for finding missing children and tracking the black market are under-resourced and under-staffed. One of the few safeguards for mothers whose children are taken is Missing Child Kenya, an NGO founded and run by Maryana Munyendo. In its four years in operation, the organisation has worked on about 600 cases, Munyendo said. ""This is a very big issue in Kenya but it is under-reported. At Missing Child Kenya we have barely scratched the surface."" The issue had ""not been prioritised in action response plans for social welfare,"" she said. That is partly because this is a crime whose victims tend to be vulnerable, voiceless women like Rebecca, who do not have the resources or social capital to draw media attention or drive action from the authorities. ""The under-reporting has a strong correlation to the economic status of the victims,"" Munyendo said. ""They lack the resources, networks and information to be able go somewhere and say, 'Hey, can someone follow up on my missing child?'"" The driving force behind the black market is a persistent cultural stigma around infertility. ""Infertility is not a good thing for a woman in an African marriage,"" Munyendo said. ""You are expected to have a child and it should be a boy. If you can't, you might get kicked out of your home. So what do you do? You steal a child."" A boy in the Nairobi slum Kayole, where child trafficking is ""booming"", a local journalist said A woman in that situation will most likely be put in touch with a trafficker like Anita's boss, who uses vulnerable people like Anita to snatch children on the street. Or they might be connected to someone with access to a hospital. According to Africa Eye's research, child-trafficking rings are operating within the walls of some of Nairobi's biggest government-run hospitals. Through a source, we approached Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. It is Leparan's job to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable children born at Mama Lucy. But our source said Leparan was directly involved in trafficking. The source arranged to meet Leparan, and told him he knew of a woman desperate to purchase a child after failing to conceive. ""I have this baby boy in the hospital,"" Leparan replied. ""They dropped him off two weeks ago and never came back."" According to our source, this was not the first time Leparan had arranged to sell a child. ""The last case scared me,"" Leparan said in the meeting, which Africa Eye recorded. ""Suppose we do this, I want a plan that won't cause us problems later on,"" he said. Fred Leparan accepted 300,000 Kenyan shillings to steal a child from Mama Lucy hospital Children like the abandoned baby boy on offer from Leparan should be taken to a government children's home while they are placed officially with foster parents who have been subject to background and welfare checks. When they are sold illegally by people like Fred Leparan, nobody really knows where they will end up. Posing as a woman called Rose, an undercover reporter working for Africa Eye met Leparan at an office close to the hospital. Leparan asked a few cursory questions about Rose's status. She said she was married but could not conceive, and was under pressure from her husband's family to give birth. ""Have you tried adoption?"" Leparan asked. ""We thought about it but it seems like it is a bit complicated,"" Rose replied. With that, Leparan agreed. The price would be 300,000 shillings â Â£2,000. ""If we go ahead with this deal it will only be the three of us - me, you and him,"" he said, pointing to Rose and our source. ""My issue is trusting someone. It is very risky. It worries me a lot."" He said he would be in touch to arrange the sale. Between the street snatchers like Anita and the corrupt officials like Leparan, there is another layer to Nairobi's child-trafficking business. Dotted around some of the city's slums you can find illegal street clinics with delivery rooms for expectant mothers. These makeshift clinics are a known location for the black-market trade in babies. Working with a local journalist, Judith Kanaitha of Ghetto Radio, Africa Eye approached a clinic in Nairobi's Kayole neighbourhood, home to thousands of the city's poorest residents. According to Kanaitha, the baby trade is booming in Kayole. The clinic we approached is operated by a woman known as Mary Auma, who said she had worked as a nurse in some of Nairobi's biggest hospitals. Kanaitha posed as a buyer. Inside the clinic, two women were already in labour. ""This one, she is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she is almost ready to deliver,"" Auma said, whispering. She offered to sell the unborn child to Kanaitha for 45,000 shillings â Â£315. Auma did not appear concerned for the mother's welfare after the birth. ""As soon as she gets her money, she will go,"" she said, waving her hand. ""We make it clear, they never come back."" This video can not be played Mary Auma negotiates the sale at her street clinic The woman in the clinic that day whose unborn baby Auma was negotiating for sale was Adama. Adama was broke. Like Rebecca, she had been abandoned by the man who got her pregnant, and the pregnancy had cost her her job on a construction site when she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. So Adama decided to sell her baby. Mary Auma was not offering her the 45,000 shillings she was attempting to charge us. She told Adama the deal was for just 10,000 â Â£70. ""Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,"" Adama said later, in an interview in her village. ""But I was desperate and I didn't have a choice."" Adama said that the day we walked into the clinic, Mary Auma had just induced her, without warning, by giving her tablets to swallow. Auma had a buyer and was keen to make a sale. But the birth was not smooth. The baby boy had chest issues and Auma told Adama to take him to Mama Lucy hospital for treatment. After two weeks, Adama was discharged with the baby. She texted Auma, and Auma texted us. ""New package has been born,"" she wrote. ""45,000k."" Illegal street clinics dot the Nairobi slums like Kayole At the clinic, Adama was reunited with Auma and her assistant. ""They said the baby looked OK and if the client wanted him he would be taken straightaway,"" she said. Adama had made a painful choice to sell her child. Now she was reconsidering. ""I did not want to sell my baby to someone who would not be able to take care of him, or someone who buys babies to go use them for other things,"" she said later. So Adama left the clinic that day carrying her baby boy. She dropped him instead at the government-run children's hospital, where he would wait for foster parents and, she hoped, a better life. She never got the money she needed. She lives alone now, away from Nairobi, and sometimes she dreams about her son and wakes in the early hours and thinks about him. Sometimes, if she can't get back to sleep, she walks down the road in the dark until she finds someone else awake. But she doesn't regret her choice. ""I feel at peace to have given my baby to the government,"" she said, ""because I know he is safe."" Fred Leparan, the clinical social worker at the government hospital, called to say he had identified a baby boy given up by his mother that he wanted to steal for us. The boy was one of three children at the hospital waiting to be transferred to a nearby children's home. It was Leparan's job to ensure they got there safely. But Leparan knew that once the babies left Mama Lucy hospital, there was only a slim chance anyone from there would check they had arrived at the home. At the hospital, Leparan filled out the necessary paperwork and made small talk with the staff, who had no idea that a child was being stolen on their watch. Rose, the undercover reporter, was waiting in a car outside. Leparan told the hospital nurses she worked for the children's home and asked them to take the babies out to her. He seemed increasingly anxious, but he assured our source that the nurses would not follow them. ""No, they can't, they have work to do,"" he said. Then he urged the team to leave quickly. ""If we keep chatting like this someone may suspect,"" he said. This video can not be played Fred Leparan orchestrates the transfer of the child at Mama Lucy Moments later, the team drove out of Mama Lucy hospital with three infant children in the car and instructions to deliver just two of them to the children's home. From there, the third baby could have gone anywhere, to anyone. The undercover team delivered all three children safely to the home, where they will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. Later that afternoon, Leparan called Rose to a meeting and instructed her to place the agreed 300,000 shillings on the table. He instructed her to see a nutritionist. ""The only thing to keep an eye on is the boy's vaccine mark,"" he said. ""Also, be careful. Be very careful."" The BBC confronted Fred Leparan about this transaction but he refused to comment. The hospital also declined requests to comment, and Leparan appears to have kept his job. We also informed a children's rights NGO about Mary Auma's illegal street clinic in Kayole, which in turn informed the police. But Auma appears to still be in business. She did not respond when we put our allegations to her. And we attempted to put our allegations to Anita, but she seemed to have once again disappeared into the shadows of the street. ""We all want to be mothers to our children,"" Rebecca said. ""It is not our fault we are in the streets."" For the mothers whose children were stolen, there will never be any real resolution. Most go on in limbo, hoping to see their child again, knowing that they probably won't. Rebecca would give ""everything"" to see her son, she said. ""And if he died I would like to know too."" Last year, she heard that someone saw a boy in a distant neighbourhood of Nairobi that looked just like her eldest daughter, Lawrence Josiah's sister. Rebecca knew it was probably nothing, and she had no way of getting to the neighbourhood and no idea where to look if she did. She did get as far as the local police station, but she couldn't get any help, she said, and eventually she gave up. ""There is a one in a million chance these women will see their children again,"" said Maryana Munyendo, from Missing Child Kenya. ""Many of the street mothers are children themselves, and they are taken advantage of in their vulnerability."" People like Rebecca were too often not seen as sympathetic victims of crime, Munyendo said. ""But nobody should assume that people on the street do not have feelings, that they do not deserve justice. They do have feelings. The way you miss your child if you live in a suburban area is the same way you miss your child if you are a mother on the street."" Some of the babies stolen from the street will end up in those suburban areas. Sometimes Rebecca thinks about the wealthier women who paid for them â about what it takes to raise a child you know was stolen from someone else. ""What are they thinking?"" she said. ""How do they feel?"" Additional reporting by Kassim Mohamed and Elijah Kanyi. Photographs by Brian Inganga. All images copyright Imported for my body: Trafficked to India for sex.

Supermarkets' greeting card sales 'grossly unfair',"It is ""grossly unfair"" that supermarkets can sell greeting cards in lockdown while specialist retailers have to shut their shops, the boss of Clintons cards has told the BBC. Eddie Shepherd said some retailers were ""exploiting"" ambiguities in the rules. Until 2 December, shops in England selling ""non-essential"" goods such as gifts, books and homeware must close. But those deemed essential can continue to sell non-essential itemsif they are stocked on their aisles. It has sparked a wave of complaints against supermarkets, garden centres and newsagents, with the boss of book chain Waterstones saying the government guidance ""doesn't make sense"". Are big retailers exploiting lockdown loopholes? Clothes and book sellers furious at lockdown rules Christmas cards 'even more poignant' this year Mr Shepherd told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up To Money programme: ""If our category and product is deemed to be non-essential, which it is, then that should apply in all retail scenarios. ""But garden centres and supermarkets often operate card and gift sections as large as some High Street stores and they are able to continue to trade in these sections whilst we're not."" He added: ""I think elements of the legislation are unclear and it's affording an ambiguity that people are able to exploit."" The Range, which also sells groceries, has been criticised for marketing non-essential goods ahead of Christmas Clintons' sales dropped sharply in the first national lockdown and the chain - which has 270 UK shops - hoped to make up for it this Christmas. But Mr Shepherd said its revenue in December was likely to be 20% lower than usual, in part due to trade lost to essential retailers. ""Undoubtedly an element of what was the available market will be gone at the point we reopen,"" he said. Clothes and book sellers have also criticised the lockdown rules in England, with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) accusing the government of creating ""arbitrary"" lines between retailers. During Wales's recent two-week lockdown, essential retailers had to cordon off aisles selling clothes and toys, although this sparked anger among some customers. James Daunt, the boss of book chain Waterstones, has repeatedly criticised the fact that WH Smith continues to sell books in its shops in lockdown because it is a newsagent, while his business can only sell online. On Monday, he told the BBC: ""I don't think anyone would object to the supermarkets being open to sell food and pharmacies to sell medicines. ""What I am objecting to is really very comparable retailers are open, and others closed, and I think that really hurts the independents."" The BRC estimates non-essential retailers in England will lose Â£2bn of sales in the lockdown, which began on 5 November. However, the Department For Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy maintains the new restrictions will limit social contact and slow the spread of coronavirus. ""We recognise this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses, which is why we've confirmed that there will be a full package of financial support in place,"" a government spokesperson said last week.

Police 'let people down' on night of Arena bombTwenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured as they left the Ariana Grande concert in 2017.,"Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan agreed British Transport Police (BTP) had made mistakes A senior officer at British Transport Police has accepted the force let the public down on the night of the Manchester Arena attack. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan has been giving evidence to the public inquiry into the atrocity. He agreed mistakes were made, including having no officers in the foyer where bomber Salman Abedi hid before the blast which killed 22 people. Mr O'Callaghan said the attack had ""happened on [BTP's] watch"". Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more were injured as they left an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. The inquiry previously heard there wereno police officers on patrolwhen 22-year-old Abedi made his journey from Victoria Station to the City Room. BTP had primary responsibility for policing in the arena foyerÂ due to the proximity of Victoria railway station. ""The attack that happened that night happened on our watch,"" Mr O'Callaghan, who was not working for the force at the time, said. ""There is not a day that goes by when BTP doesn't consider that."" He added: ""Did we let the people down? ""It was our responsibility to police that arena and that attack happened when we were policing it, there were police officers planned to be deployed to the site of the attack and they were not there - so in that term, yes."" Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell Mr O'Callaghan agreed if BTP officers had been in the City Room at the end of the show, Abedi could have been challenged before he detonated his bomb. He acknowledged it was ""unacceptable"" two of the officers on duty had taken a two-hour break including a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab, but it would be ""right and proper"" to wait for the inquiry's findings before taking any further action. John Cooper QC, representing some of the bereaved families, said: ""You'll understand the families' concerns when at least one of them has photographs receiving commendations?"" Mr O'Callaghan said that after the bomb went off, the officers went on to perform ""extremely brave actions"". He also denied the threat of terrorism at the arena had been disregarded by BTP at the time, saying: ""The information officers had at the time was up to 100 concerts a year had been going on at the arenaâ¦there was nothing to focus the mind on people planning a policing response that a person-borne IED was plausible at that time."" Since the attack there have been a number of improvements made to police planning for events at the arena, Mr O'Callaghan told the court. This includes specific counter-terrorism briefings for officers, documented risk assessments specific to each event and more multi-agency meetings. The inquiry continues.

'Millions of dental treatments missed' in pandemic,"Dentists have provided around 19m fewer treatments in England since March this year compared to the same period last year, figures show. British Dental Association (BDA) analysis, seen by the BBC, shows practices operating at a fraction of their capacity during the pandemic. It warns hundreds of practices could be forced to close within the next year without extra financial support. The government said the NHS was working hard to restore dental care. New coronavirus regulations mean dentists have had to significantly reduce the numbers they treat - in order to clean the surgery between patients to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus. Coronavirus: No return to 'business as usual' for dentists Coronavirus: Dentists 'firefighting' to deal with backlog NHS data shows 19 million fewer treatments - which includes both appointments for emergency treatment and check-ups - were offered in England between March and October in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. And during September and October, dental practices were operating at just one-third of last year's level. The BDA has warned that the reduction in the number of patients seen, paired with the closing of dentists, could have a dramatic impact on patients' oral health. The group sent a questionnaire to all 12,000 owners of NHS and private dental practices. Of the 1,337 who responded, 740 said they would not be financially viable a year from now unless they were given extra support. It has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that, without government intervention, the country risks ""an oral health crisis"". This video can not be played Tim Miller: ""It felt like acid was being poured in my eye"" Tim Miller, 50, had a fractured tooth which became an abscess that went behind his eye, damaging his eyesight. ""It felt like acid was being poured in my eye. That was the start of about eight and a half months of discomfort and pain as I tried to find an NHS dentist."" ""I must have tried about 10. When eventually I located one - the best advice they could come up with was can you go private?"" ""I did have some incredibly dark thoughts. I got to the point where I wanted it to stop and there wasn't much I wouldn't have done to make it stop."" Tim, who is on benefits, is not signed up with an NHS dentist. He only managed to afford private treatment after several of his friends chipped in to pay the bill. His tooth was taken out and his infection is now receding - but he is waiting to find out if he may have permanent damage to his eyesight. Christina Chatfield, who owns the Dental Health Spa in Brighton, where Tim was treated, says she has taken on Â£100,000 worth of debt to keep her practice open. But she says: ""The real problem is for those who don't get care. Problems will exacerbate. Kids will have more root canals which aren't available on the NHS. That means more extractions and more orthodontics. ""And without check ups we will be missing mouth cancers - normally nationally we spot 22 cases per day."" The BDA poll found 70% of the practices who responded were operating at less than half their pre-pandemic capacity. Sam Shah, group clinical director for East Village Dental, a group of six practices in the south of England, said: ""At least two of my surgeries, both in deprived communities with high levels of need, are at risk of closing within the next 12 months if the government doesn't intervene. ""The communities have a lack of access to any other NHS dental services."" Mr Shah added: ""We've seen an increase in the number of people using painkillers to manage dental pain - and that has led to an increase in the number of people presenting at A&E after inadvertently overdosing on paracetamol or ibuprofen."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The NHS is working hard to resume the routine elective services that were paused as part of the response to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. ""All dentists are able to remain open to patients and those holding NHS contracts have continued to be paid in full throughout the pandemic. ""Priority access is expected to be given to urgent care and vulnerable groups, with over 600 urgent dental centres continuing to provide extra support to the dental sector.""

Student 'traumatised' by 'racial profiling',"Zac Adan says he was left traumatised by the incident The University of Manchester has suspended security officers who were accused of ""racially profiling"" a student. It comes after footage posted online showed first-year student Zac Adan held up against a wall by security guards who demanded to see his ID. Mr Adan, 19, said he was accused of ""looking like a drug dealer"" by staff at Fallowfield halls of residence. The university said it was investigating the ""serious incident"". ""We are deeply concerned by these images,"" it added in a statement. ""We have spoken to the student concerned, launched a full investigation and have suspended the security officers (without prejudice), pending the results of this investigation."" Mr Adan, a French and Linguistics student at the university, said he had been ""traumatised"" by the incident and has not been able to sleep since it took place. Returning to his halls of residence after visiting a local shop, he had been asked to present his identification, he said. ""I had my ID card in my hand and they tried to snatch it from me. The next thing I know I was being pinned up against the wall,"" he said. Mr Adan said everyone on campus had been told to show their identification to security guards on the gate before entering. He added: ""There was no conversation. They just pinned me up against the wall and said I looked like a drug dealer. Why? Because I am black and wearing a hoodie?"" Zac considered studying law at another university before opting for languages at Manchester In the footage, security guards can be seen walking off after looking at his university identification. One officer explains to a student nearby: ""When you showed your card, you covered your face up - that's all."" It comes afterstudents tore down ""prison-like"" fencingwhich was erected around Fallowfield campus on day one of England's new lockdown. The university apologised ""for the concern and distress caused"" at the time, saying ""alternative security measures, including additional security patrols are being put in place"". In an exclusive interview, Mr Adan, who is the first in his family to go to university, told the BBC he believed this was an example of racial profiling and said it could be damaging to prospective students. ""It's disgusting, I haven't been able to sleep. I am traumatised by the situation,"" he said. ""My parents came from Somalia as refugees and have given up everything for me to be at this institution. ""I am the first person in my family to go to university, so for me it's an achievement - but when they hear about things like this happening, my parents are begging me to go back home."" Mr Adan said he moved to the UK from Italy a few years ago and has ""suffered racism"" all his life, but added: ""Britain has been so accepting and welcoming, I genuinely think this is one of the most accepting countries in the world and, when things like this happen, it lets the country down."" He is calling for the university to apologise and says he wants to speak to its chancellor. ""I want to be able to live in peace and enter my flat in peace and not be stopped and abused by the people we are paying to protect us,"" he said. In a statement, a spokesperson for the university said: ""On Saturday, 14 November we were made aware of an alleged serious incident on our campus and began investigating it immediately. ""We have been in regular contact with the affected party and keeping them fully informed of our progress.

Astronaut crew launch to space station,"This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Four astronauts - three from the US and one from Japan - have launched from Florida on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew rode to orbit in a rocket and capsule provided by the SpaceX company. It's only the second time the firm has supplied the service. The US space agency Nasa has said it is now entering a new era in which routine astronaut journeys to low-Earth orbit are being conducted by commercial providers. The four individuals making their way up to the ISS are the Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. By participating in this mission, Noguchi becomes only the third person in history to leave Earth in three different types of space vehicle, having previously flown on Soyuz and shuttle hardware. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? How astronaut transportation went commercial Orbital apparel: Evolution of the spacesuit The traditional ""walk-out"": The suited crew waved to family and friends The crew's Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule left the pad at the Kennedy Space Center at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It took 12 minutes for the Falcon to get the Dragon into the right part of the sky and drop it off. ""Well done, that was one heck of a ride,"" crew commander Mike Hopkins radioed down to controllers. ""Congratulations to everyone. Resilience is in orbit."" ""Resilience"" is the name the astronauts have given their capsule. The ship will use its own thrusters to complete the rest of the journey up to the station. A docking with the orbiting platform is set for about 0400 GMT on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the team arrives, it will join Nasa's Kate Rubins and Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Having seven people on the 410km-high outpost will triple the amount of science that can be performed in its special microgravity environment. The crew was driven down to the launch pad in a convoy of Tesla electric cars SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company rana demonstration mission in Mayin which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth. The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. ""The big milestone here is that we are now moving away from development and test and into operational flights. And in fact this operational flight was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. So this is a truly a commercial launch,"" commented Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is more than a year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit is saving billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions. To that end, Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024, or soon after. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: A guide Hopkins, Glover, Walker and Noguchi will stay on the ISS for six months. Just before they return to Earth, they'll be joined aloft by another SpaceX-launched crew for a brief handover. Indeed, the coming year is going to be very busy for the Californian service provider with plenty of trips up to the station being made by both its crewed and cargo-only versions of Dragon. ""In the next 15 months, we should be flying roughly seven Dragon missions. And this mission represents the initiation of a Dragon in orbit continuously - knocking on wood - and certainly is really the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight,"" said SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. The company president was in attendance at Kennedy, carrying out media duties in place of founder and CEO Elon Musk who is said to be suffering a mild case of Covid. A dramatic shot of the Merlin engines firing at the base of the Falcon rocket Nasa retired its winged space shuttles in 2011. In the intervening years, it's been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz vehicles. This purchase option will now close in favour of the new American-sourced taxis. But US astronauts will continue to go to the station on Soyuz from time to time - it's just that no money will change hands. Instead, Russian cosmonauts will get flights in the American capsules in exchange. Soichi Noguchi has now flown in a SpaceX Dragon, a Soyuz capsule and a space shuttle The new crew will have at least four spacewalks to perform in their time at the station. In one of those walks, they will install the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is theColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS research module, Columbus. The UK participates on the station through its membership of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that is a separate legal entity to the European Union. Will the UK have a seat on a space taxi? Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency The UK participates in the International Space Station, because the UK Space Agency exploration programme is part of the European Space Agency programme. We already have British scientists who are able to use the facilities on the ISS. And there are some experiments in development now to be carried out aboard the space station in the coming years. One, called the BioAsteroid project, run by the University of Edinburgh, will investigate how gravity affects the interaction between microbes and rock in reduced gravity. Astronauts on these space taxis will be taking these UK-led experiments to and from the space station. And much of the science can actually be operated remotely from the ground. We may well also see British astronauts flying on this vehicle in the future, too.

UK shares jump on second Covid vaccine hopes,"Global share prices have surged following news of a second breakthrough coronavirus vaccine, following last week's positive results from Pfizer. Interim data from the US firm Moderna suggests its vaccine is highly effective in preventing people getting ill and works across all age groups. The news pushed Moderna shares more than 9% higher and the Dow to a record. It also lifted firms hit by the virus, with British Airways owner IAG rising 10% and Cineworld up 13.5%. In the US, theDow Jones Industrial Averagehit a new high, after jumping about 1.6%. The widerS&P 500increased almost 1.2% from Friday's record and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%. Earlier, the UK'sFTSE 100 share indexclosed about 1.6% higher, while the main market in Paris rose 1.7% and in Germany shares gained 0.5%. Last week, stock markets enjoyed one of their best ever days when a vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech raised hopes that the business world might return to normal next year. A number of other vaccines are also being developed. The gains spurred by Moderna's news on Monday were more muted but still helped the MSCI World Index of global shares to rise further, climbing to a new record high. Firms that have been hit most badly in the pandemic have seen the biggest rises. In the travel sector, cruise line Carnival jumped more than 10%, while Intercontinental Hotels closed almost 5% higher. The prospect of an end to lockdowns also helped oil prices strengthen. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices were up about 3%, and shares in energy companies also gained. The price of gold - which is often seen as a safer asset in times of uncertainty - slipped 0.7% before recovering. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said markets are being driven by a ""tug-of-war between optimism over COVID-19 vaccine progress versus fear of economic slowing as COVID-19 cases continue to rise"". But he said low interest rates, stimulus and medical progress give him a ""glass half-full"" outlook. ""We expect equity prices to inch higher into year-end and 2021, with increased volatility being more the norm than exception,"" he said, Until vaccines can be rolled out, rising cases of the coronavirus were a risk, said Morgan Stanley strategists in a research note to investors. But the investment bank urged shareholders to ""keep the faith... We think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy"".

British diplomat saves drowning Chinese woman,"This video can not be played Just one month into his new role as consul general, Stephen Ellison saves a university student from drowning A British diplomat has been hailed as a hero after diving into a river in China to save a drowning student. Stephen Ellison, 61, consul-general in Chongqing, was walking by a river in a nearby village when the woman, 24, slipped on rocks into the deep water. Footage filmed by onlookers showed her struggle in the fast-moving current, disappear under a footbridge and emerge face down, apparently unconscious. Mr Ellison took off his shoes and dived in to save her. She has not been named. Stephen Ellison, centre, said the woman was shaken by the experience but recovering The consul general, who takes part in triathlons, turned the student over, lifted her face clear of the water and swam backwards to the steep sided riverbank. ""She was unconscious, she was not breathing and for a short time we feared the worst. But as we got back to the side, she started breathing again"" he told the BBC of the rescue, which took place on Saturday morning. The diplomat held onto a lifebuoy attached to a rope that had been thrown towards him by passers-by, who then pulled the woman to safety. Mr Ellison swam round to shallower rocks and climbed out. He was given dry clothes and warm drinks by grateful villagers. He said the student, who is from Wuhan and attends Chongqing University, was shaken by the experience and recovering slowly. But she was extremely grateful and has invited him to dinner with her family next weekend. Mr Ellison, originally from Newcastle, is head of the British mission in Chongqing - where his role is primarily to support bilateral trade links between Britain and China. Kerry Allen - China media analyst Relations between China and the UK have been rapidly deteriorating over the past year, amid rows over Hong Kong, tech firm Huawei and the coronavirus. Yet there's full praise online for Mr Ellison, with Chinese social media users calling him a ""hero"", a ""role model"" and someone who is ""worthy of admiration"" for saving the student, who media said fell ""while taking pictures"". He's being described as ""uncle"", a term almost never used to describe foreigners. ""You'd call such a person a knight in the UK; in China we call him a hero,"" one user on the popular Sina Weibo site says. ""For such a big official to go into the water himself to save someoneâ¦ you've got to like this,"" another wrote. Footage of the incident filmed on locals' phones has racked up more than a million views after it was posted online by popular media outlets Global Times and Pear Video. It's also got locals doing a bit of self-reflection on how they view foreigners. Despite recent negative feeling towards Britain, many Chinese say they're ""shocked"" that ""so many [local] people were watching, and not a single person rushed to the water themselves"" to help. Such scenes are common in China - crowds of people standing watching a developing incident. Many fear that rushing to involve themselves could lead to their being implicated. Where this has happenedpreviously, many have debated whether China has a ""morality"" issue.

PM confident UK 'will prosper' without EU deal,"Boris Johnson says the UK will ""prosper"" without a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU Boris Johnson has reiterated he is ""confident [the UK] will prosper"" outside the EU if a post-Brexit trade deal is not agreed with the bloc. Talks began again in Brussels on Monday, with the UK's chief negotiator saying there had been ""progress"". Lord David Frost told reporters: ""We're working very hard to get a deal but there's quite a lot to do."" His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said he wanted ""future cooperation to be open but fair"" with the UK. Tweeting,externalas talks started, he added: ""We remain determined, patient, respectful."" Sticking points between the two sides focus on competition rules and state aid for businesses, as well as fishing rights. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said there was still a ""very, very wide gap"" on fishing, with no progress on the issue since the summer. He told RTE: ""Until we can find a way of doing that, there isn't going to be an agreement."" Brexit trade sticking points 'can be resolved' What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year while negotiations take place. Any deal between the UK and EU would need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, so time is running out for an agreement to be reached and to get the sign off before 31 December. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs. The government was planning a policy re-launch this week after rows within Downing Street and departures of key members of staff - including Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. As part of its reset statement, No 10 said the talks this week would be ""crucial"". The statement added: ""The prime minister has been clear that we will not accept any proposals in the negotiations that undermine our status as a sovereign, independent country. ""If the EU don't respect the sovereignty of the UK, we will leave onAustralian termsand the prime minister is confident that we will prosper."" Mr Johnson is now having to self-isolate for 14-daysafter meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. But in a video made by Downing Street, he said he was ""in good health"", ""had no symptoms"", and would ""continue to lead"" from his flat. Government and EU officials describe this negotiating week as ""crucial"". Time really is running out now. The standstill transition period, which followed Brexit in January, stops at the end of next month. By then, not only does a deal need to have been agreed, but also ratified by parliament in the UK and the EU. Chief UK negotiator David Frost said on Sunday that some progress had been made of late, but that considerable differences remained. He said he'd only agree to a deal that respected UK sovereignty and a no deal outcome was still possible. To avoid that, the government and the EU know they will have to compromise. ""This is move week,"" proclaimed Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. But who's going to move first? And are both sides prepared to concede enough to clinch a deal? Meanwhile, the chief executive of the British Ports Association said his industry has found it ""agonising"" to get some of the information from the government about the infrastructure they will need to function after the transition period ends. Giving evidence to the Lords' EU Goods Sub-Committee, Richard Ballantyne said leaving without a trade deal could make it ""completely impossible"" to accommodate animal and plant products coming into the country. He added: ""It would basically put traders at a real disadvantage bringing their goods in to certain routes and gateways if they know that a high percentage of those volumes need to be opened and inspected.""

Further Covid restrictions 'needed mid-December',"Christmas lights were switched on at Belfast City Hall on Saturday, but without the crowds usually in attendance, due to the virus The executive will do all it can to ""protect"" as much of the Christmas period as possible, Michelle O'Neill has said. It comes after NI's chief scientific adviser warned further Covid-19 restrictions will likely be recommended before Christmas. Prof Ian Young said mid-December could be the ""big risk period"". The deputy first minister said it was difficult to provide certainty but she wanted to give people ""some comfort"". The executive's ""clear commitment"" was to secure that, she added. Some of the current Covid-19 restrictions are due to end on Friday with the reopening of close-contact services and unlicensed hospitality businesses. That decision was taken by ministers on Thursday, followingfour days of heated disagreements and delay. Prof Young has warned that Christmas ""cannot be completely normal"" as allowing people to interact will increase the risks. ""There would be an option of measures which the executive would need to consider and I think everybody is familiar with what those restrictions look like,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""They have to minimise the interactions between people, particularly in indoor settings, in order to reduce transmission of the virus as much as possible."" His warning came theDepartment of Health recorded a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths,external, bringing the death toll to 869. A further 331 positive cases have been reported in the last 24 hours. In the Republic of Ireland five further coronavirus-related deaths and 456 new cases were recorded on Monday. The Irish Department of Health said there were 33 people in ICU, two more than Sunday. Speaking in the assembly on Monday, Ms O'Neill said the executive wanted to be able to ""give people something, in terms of being able to spend some time with family members"". ""It will be dependent of the virus spread at the time... we should be able to give people a bit of flexibility to allow people to get over the Christmas period,"" she said. The deputy first minister said the R-number - or reproduction value of the virus - in Northern Ireland was now at 0.9, and ""perhaps going towards one"". Any decisions about the Christmas period would have to be taken on the basis of health advice, she said. Addressing the criticism directed at ministers over the delay in agreeing restrictions, Ms O'Neill said the executive needed to ""collectively get a grip"". The deputy first minister said it was a ""matter of profound concern and regret"" that the DUP had blocked health proposals by triggering a cross-community vote. It can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis. It effectively gives parties with enough ministers a veto. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance had voted to extend the restrictions - but the DUP's decision to deploy the cross-community mechanism meant the plan was blocked. ""It should have been the will of the executive which carried it through, but I accept this is now the outworking of the executive, and we're all duty-bound to communicate the decision to the public,"" she added First Minister Arlene Foster defended her party's decision to use the veto. ""We all know those who want to apportion blame and the use of vetoes, but the truth is we should never have gotten to that point,"" she told the assembly on Monday. ""I hope in our discussions in the coming days, which again will be difficult, which again will be controversial, I hope we can get to a point without invoking all of that."" In other coronavirus-related developments on Monday: TheCovid-19 self-isolation grant,externaldaily allowance is being increased and the number of days for which an award can be made is being extended Kidneytransplant operations have been suspended in Northern Irelandbecause of the extra pressure Covid-19 is placing on the health service NI's chief medical officer has urged people tolook after their mental health and wellbeingthis winter The Department of Health has placed a Â£15m order with Limavady-based Paragon Health for face masks for health workers. Prof Young was also asked about schools closing early for Christmas When asked about schools closing early for Christmas, Prof Young said keeping schools open was a top priority for the executive. However, he said ""opening schools will tend to increase the transmission of the virus in the community"". ""Less because of what happens in schools and more because of what happens outside schools as people interact in different ways,"" he said. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, saidcomments by the health ministerand chief scientific adviser on the possibility of further restrictions has a ""damaging and demoralising"" effect on business owners and staff. ""It makes them worry about whether or not the new dates they've been told when they can reopen will actually happen,"" he said. Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has rejected accusations that not enough planning was done to manage a winter surge of Covid-19 in NI. He said the health service had been ready, but he could ""never have planned for scientific and medical advice given to the executive being blocked"". Mr Swann was answering an urgent question in the assembly from the DUP about his assessment of whether the surge planning framework had worked, in light of ""hospitals across Northern Ireland operating at over capacity"".

Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic,"This video can not be played ""It can be shocking sometimes,"" says probation officer Salli Dixon Working from home during a pandemic has brought extra challenges for probation officers who work with serious offenders after their release from prison. Many have had to handle unpleasant subject matter in their own homes, as they deal remotely with violent or sexual offenders. I spent the day with a member of the probation team that works with the 50 most dangerous male offenders in Cardiff, to see how they are managing. Salli Dixon is part of the special team of probation officers usually based at a police station. While some face-to-face appointments have continued, whether in the office or the offender's doorstep, others have to be done over the phone or by video call. The pandemic also means more of the work is done remotely from home, including work with sex offenders. ""It makes it a little more hard to switch off mentally, and you're having really difficult conversations in your home environment, which feels intrusive,"" she says. ""But it hasn't made the service any less effective. We can't have a less effective service - we protect the public, so we've just had to adapt."" Her first call of the day is with a registered child sex offender, who is living in a halfway house after recently being released from prison. Salli speaking to a registered sex offender who ""gets anxious"" and thinks the ""way out"" might be going back to prison He's tested positive for Covid-19 and has been moved into isolation quarters, meaning their appointment must now be over the phone. He tells her he's anxious about plans to find him his own flat where he would be living alone full-time. The length of time prison leavers spend in approved premises like a halfway house has been reduced during the pandemic. ""It's a little early if I'm honest - far, far too early,"" he says. ""When my mind is in a corner and up against a wall - it just goes 'right where is the way out? The way out is to go back to prison'."" Many probation checks not carried out in lockdown Child sexual offences double in five years Covid rules keep inmates in cells 23 hours a day His anxieties are kicking in, meaning his risks increase, Salli explains. ""He has got 16 or 17 instances of breaching his restrictions, usually by going too close to an area where there are children - like a nursery or school. He says he does that because he wants to self-sabotage and go back into prison,"" she says. ""So when he feels that he is being moved into his own accommodation, where he'll be by himself, he gets anxious and he thinks it's easier to just do something that would warrant him going back inside. ""The risk to the public would be that he would commit a child contact sex offence. He hasn't done that yet, but we can't rule out that he wouldn't."" ""We're not completely desensitised, we still hear things that shock us"" How does she feel discussing the nature of his offending? ""We're not completely desensitised as probation officers, because we still hear things that shock us,"" she says. ""No matter how long you've done a job it is quite difficult sometimes and quite unusual to hear somebody talk candidly about their sexual views towards children."" The small team deals with complex cases - like repeat domestic violence or sex offenders who also have additional issues, such as a personality disorder, mental health problems or drug and alcohol misuse. Known as Wisdom (Wales Integrated Serious and Dangerous Offender Management), they have a reduced case load to reflect the risks posed, as well as more resources than typical probation officers. Her second case of the day is able to come to the office. He committed a sex offence against a vulnerable adult and was released earlier this year after decades in prison. One of the sex offenders Salli is working with has struggled with the pace of life outside prison, but has done ""phenomenally well"" Much has changed since he was a young man on the outside, and he says the pace of life compared with prison has felt overwhelming at times. Weeks after his release, lockdown was announced and he too wonders whether it would be better to be back in prison.

'Weeks' before Covid Christmas rules agreed,"This video can not be played We cannot go back to normal, says health minister It could be ""weeks"" before there is an announcement on the Covid rules around Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. Welsh ministers and other UK administrations are in talks over a set of agreed rules for the festive period. Vaughan Gething said whatever happened, the period would ""not be like normal"". ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" he told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" Students going home should travel by 9 December Not all students in Wales will get Covid tests Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic There had been calls for a single approach from the different UK administrations about Christmas so families who live in different areas can deal with a single set of rules. Vaughan Gething said this Christmas would ""not be like normal"" Mr Gething said discussions were ongoing about what will be in place for travel, ""and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact"". ""But it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks"", he added. He noted thatother faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. Meanwhile Mr Gething said the rate of cases in Wales was continuing to fall, one week after Wales' firebreak lockdown. Cases in Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen the highest case rate of any local authority in the UK, have more than halved, he said. ""On Friday, I said we were starting to see some very early positive signs that cases of coronavirus are beginning to fall. This downward trend is continuing."" The seven-day incidence rate for Wales is now at about 160 cases per 100,000 people - a reduction of 70 from this time last week, he said. He also said people needed to be aware of the differences between coronavirus and seasonal flu, with the former having a higher mortality rate and a greater proportion of sufferers becoming seriously ill. After the news ofanother potentially effective vaccine, Mr Gething said he ""doesn't plan"" to make Covid vaccines mandatory. He said he had never tried to mandate any vaccine, and would not want to do so with Covid. ""I'm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine , then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their community"" he added. This video can not be played Shoppers are back in Cardiff after lockdown ends On Sunday, Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said it was a""worry"" to see queues of people outside shopsat the weekend. Mr Gething said there had been ""pent-up demand"" after the firebreak, with retailers operating limits on numbers in their stores. While he had seen pictures of people socially-distancing, ""I have seen some images that are more concerning where people have forgotten about social distancing and are returning to a more normal way of behaving. ""Now, if that continues we really will face difficult choices, and we're likely to see the trend that we've already seen with reducing cases - that can easily reverse.""

"'Millions of dental treatments missed' in pandemicThe British Dental Association warns there will be ""an oral health crisisâ without government support.","Dentists have provided around 19m fewer treatments in England since March this year compared to the same period last year, figures show. British Dental Association (BDA) analysis, seen by the BBC, shows practices operating at a fraction of their capacity during the pandemic. It warns hundreds of practices could be forced to close within the next year without extra financial support. The government said the NHS was working hard to restore dental care. New coronavirus regulations mean dentists have had to significantly reduce the numbers they treat - in order to clean the surgery between patients to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus. Coronavirus: No return to 'business as usual' for dentists Coronavirus: Dentists 'firefighting' to deal with backlog NHS data shows 19 million fewer treatments - which includes both appointments for emergency treatment and check-ups - were offered in England between March and October in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. And during September and October, dental practices were operating at just one-third of last year's level. The BDA has warned that the reduction in the number of patients seen, paired with the closing of dentists, could have a dramatic impact on patients' oral health. The group sent a questionnaire to all 12,000 owners of NHS and private dental practices. Of the 1,337 who responded, 740 said they would not be financially viable a year from now unless they were given extra support. It has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that, without government intervention, the country risks ""an oral health crisis"". This video can not be played Tim Miller: ""It felt like acid was being poured in my eye"" Tim Miller, 50, had a fractured tooth which became an abscess that went behind his eye, damaging his eyesight. ""It felt like acid was being poured in my eye. That was the start of about eight and a half months of discomfort and pain as I tried to find an NHS dentist."" ""I must have tried about 10. When eventually I located one - the best advice they could come up with was can you go private?"" ""I did have some incredibly dark thoughts. I got to the point where I wanted it to stop and there wasn't much I wouldn't have done to make it stop."" Tim, who is on benefits, is not signed up with an NHS dentist. He only managed to afford private treatment after several of his friends chipped in to pay the bill. His tooth was taken out and his infection is now receding - but he is waiting to find out if he may have permanent damage to his eyesight. Christina Chatfield, who owns the Dental Health Spa in Brighton, where Tim was treated, says she has taken on Â£100,000 worth of debt to keep her practice open. But she says: ""The real problem is for those who don't get care. Problems will exacerbate. Kids will have more root canals which aren't available on the NHS. That means more extractions and more orthodontics. ""And without check ups we will be missing mouth cancers - normally nationally we spot 22 cases per day."" The BDA poll found 70% of the practices who responded were operating at less than half their pre-pandemic capacity. Sam Shah, group clinical director for East Village Dental, a group of six practices in the south of England, said: ""At least two of my surgeries, both in deprived communities with high levels of need, are at risk of closing within the next 12 months if the government doesn't intervene. ""The communities have a lack of access to any other NHS dental services."" Mr Shah added: ""We've seen an increase in the number of people using painkillers to manage dental pain - and that has led to an increase in the number of people presenting at A&E after inadvertently overdosing on paracetamol or ibuprofen."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The NHS is working hard to resume the routine elective services that were paused as part of the response to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. ""All dentists are able to remain open to patients and those holding NHS contracts have continued to be paid in full throughout the pandemic. ""Priority access is expected to be given to urgent care and vulnerable groups, with over 600 urgent dental centres continuing to provide extra support to the dental sector.""

LiveLiveCovid-19: Monday's update from Vaughan Gething4 minutes ago,"Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the 250 deaths from Covid-19 so far in November was ""very sobering"" Outlining differences between Covid-19 and winter flu and misconceptions, Mr Gething said: ""Our bodies donât know how to fight it yet"". Christmas would ""not be like normal"" but an agreement on rules and restrictions was still weeks away, the health minister said. Working from home during the pandemic has brought extra challenges for probation officers working with serious offenders, BBC Wales reveals Face coverings could become compulsory for pupils at secondary schools in Wales, says the education minister Daily deaths from Covid-19 are running at an average of 22 in Wales, although infection case rates seem to be falling, Public Health Wales figures show Natalie Grice and Steve Duffy That brings our coverage of the coronavirus briefing to a close. Here's a reminder of the main points:  Thank you for joining us. Have a good afternoon. In case you missed this, the education minister said on Sunday secondary school pupils in Wales could be compelled to wear face coverings. Kirsty Williams said theWelsh Government was examining new scientific evidenceabout the spread of coronavirus among schoolchildren. She has told BBC Wales they are investigating what other measures can be put in place to make schools more ""Covid secure"". Pupils in some council areas already have to wear coverings in communal areas such as corridors but do not have to during lessons at present. Shoppers have returned in droves to the streets of the Welsh capital in a rush to get Christmas shopping done following the end of lockdown. One woman said she was getting it all done now in case of shop closures in the event of a return to lockdown measures. But Public Health Wales said they were worried about the impact busy queues and shops could have. This video can not be played Queues 'worry' as shoppers flock back to high street There have been two new deaths from coronavirus reported, taking the total number to 2,209. They were in Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. A further 892 cases were reported to Public Health Wales, taking the total to 67,106. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says he âdoesn't planâ to make Covid vaccines mandatory in Wales, when they become available. Speaking to journalists, he said as health minister he had never tried to mandate a vaccine, and wouldn't want to do so with the Covid vaccines. âThis is really about wanting to have safe and effective vaccines that are available for the publicâ, he said. âI do not expect and I do not plan to try and mandate those."" âIâm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine, then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their communityâ he added. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS Ministers should be working to ensure relatives can support loved ones in care homes âas much as possibleâ, Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said today. He said he had received a number of poignant e-mails from constituents expressing their concerns at a lack of contact with relatives due to coronavirus. Fast turn-around tests should be rolled out for care home visitors, he said. Asked whether visitors should be designated as key workers in order to gain priority access to tests, Mr ap Iorwerth added: âWe would have to look at whether thatâs possible for everyone, but certainly where there is a welfare issue it should be identified. âDementia patients for example, their families want to see them often; people with memory loss, people with cognitive difficulties, fear what happens if they are not able to see their loved ones for an extended period of time.â It is still too early to have a definitive view of Christmas arrangements in Wales, says the health minister. ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" Vaughan Gething told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go, actually, in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" He noted that other faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. âWhatever happens with Christmas and the festive season this year, it won't be like normal. ""We're still discussing issues about where we can get to with other governments across UK on travel, and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact but it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks.â He said recent pictures of people not social distancing in long queues while shopping meant ""if that continues we really will face difficult choices"". Mr Gething added the trend for cases reducing ""can easily reverse"". ""This is a highly infectious virus that thrives on human contact.â Vaughan Gething has rejected claims that people are dying in Welsh care homes because Covid test results are taking too long to come back. He said it was âan assertion, not borne out by all of the facts"". âWe know there are challenges in the turnaround times for testing in care homes. Weâve been clear and upfront about that.
Weâre now starting to see an improving picture when it comes to Lighthouse lab turnaround,â the health minister told journalists. Latest figures from Public Health Wales show around 20% of Lighthouse lab tests for organisations - mostly care homes - were processed within 24 hours and 82% within 48 hours. Mr Gething said Lighthouse labs were the responsibility of the UK government. The health minister said it was not just the test that kept someone safe which was why âthereâs so much importance placed on infection preventionâ. âWeâve been helping with that throughout this pandemic by making available free PPE.â Mr Gethting said a review on transmission within health care settings would report within the next few days and he would have more to say then. âWeâll be clear if there is any further action to be taken to help provide people with the assurance I know theyâre looking for.â Asked when the WG would publish weekly data for outbreaks in care homes, Mr Gething replied that some information was already in the public domain via PHW and the Care Inspectorate. 

He said he was examining what was already published to âmake sure thereâs a regular provision of information.â âI accept this is an entirely reasonable thing for people to want to seeâ¦whether there are new infections in care homes,â he added. Mr Gething said officials were developing a way to provide the information in a transparent way, saying: âIâm expecting the issue to be resolved and then to have provided clearly and transparently as soon as possible.â Health Minister Vaughan Gething says a ""different approach to testing in care homes"" could be possible to provide quicker results. The Welsh Government is looking at the different types of tests available ""in all parts of our system"" and to be available ""more broadly"" across the country. Mr Gething said investment has been made in Public Health Wales and there was further capacity in the UK government-run Lighthouse labs where ""there's now an improving picture"". He added the government now had access to the new rapid lateral flow devices as well ""but we need to understand the accuracy of those tests"". ""I think it'd be wrong to see this just in terms of one particular issue in one area without seeing the broader picture on how we utilise all the tests are available to us"", he said. ""And that's where I want to get to - to have that broader settled picture which will definitely include the potential for a different deal on visiting in care homes. ""But the work isn't finished just yet, when it is I'll make that clear in public, and I'm sure there'll be lots of people who will be looking forward to any decision we make there but I think the clarity and the whole picture is really important."" Could there be stricter Covid measures in hard-hit areas? It's ""still too early to tellâ whether stricter measures might be needed in areas with high Covid cases, said Health Minister Vaughan Gething. Speaking during Mondayâs briefing, Mr Gething said while there had been a âsharp reductionâ in cases across Wales and that was âgood newsâ, it would still take another few weeks to see the âfull impactâ of the firebreak. âWe can't have a definitive view at this point in timeâ, he said. âWeâll need to see how much further those infection rates fall before we make any choices about whether we need to do anything differently, whether that's locally or nationally.â But Mr Gething added that his preference was to have a âcommon set of national measuresâ and an âagreed wayâ of behaving to try and reduce the amount of contact between people. A survey suggests more people are only leaving their homes in Wales for essential trips. The online panel of around 500 people, for the Welsh Government, suggested 60% were only leaving home for essential journeys. This is the highest proportion since June. Around three quarters of people said they continued to try to keep two metres away from others when out. The survey also found 81% of people thought the NHS was doing a good job in dealing with Covid-19. It uses Ipsos Moriâs Global Advisor online platform to collect information from adults aged 16 to 74 and these findings were for 6-9 November. 74% of people said they were keeping to distancing rules Health Minister Vaughan Gething warned there was still so much not known about coronavirus and its long-term effects, stressing that its death rate seemed to be higher than flu. He told the press briefing: ""We donât know if any people
     have immunity to coronavirus once theyâve had it or how long that immunity
     could last. Thereâs evidence some people have caught coronavirus twice. ""Many people who have recovered
     from coronavirus are continuing to experience a range of health problems â
     this is known as long Covid. ""The World Health Organisationâs figures suggest 15% of
     people who are infected with coronavirus will develop a severe illness,
     which requires oxygen therapy and 5% of people will become critically ill. ""This is higher than that seen
      for flu. ""And sadly the death rate from coronavirus appears to
be higher than flu."" He said research by Imperial College London suggested an overall mortality rate for coronavirus of 1.15%. Seasonal flu mortality is usually around 0.1%, World Health Organisation figures say. More than 250 deaths were recorded from Covid in the first two weeks of November, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. Talking about the pattern of deaths, he told Monday's media briefing: ""There was a large peak in the first wave and it would
     appear we are now heading towards another, large peak this winter. ""This
     underlines why we introduced the firebreak. ""This is a very sobering number. But of course, these
     are not just numbers â these are people who leave behind lives and loved
     ones. ""There will be more than 250 families across Wales who are mourning
     their loss."" Public Health Wales figures show a rolling daily average of 22 deaths currently. ""I hope these figures help
     explain why we are taking coronavirus so seriously and why we â like
     governments around the world â are taking action to protect peopleâs
     health,"" said Mr Gething. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has highlighted the importance of people understanding the differences between Covid-19 and flu viruses. He told the press briefing: ""Some people believe the risks from coronavirus
have been exaggerated and others believe the action we are taking is wrong."" Mr Gething said people were familiar with flu, there was a flu vaccine and almost a century of experience in treating and managing it. ""We also have some immunity to the flu viruses, which are circulating because weâve seen these before over
many winter seasons,"" he told journalists. ""We are not familiar with
     coronavirus. Our bodies donât know how to fight it yet. ""Unlike flu, we do not have a
     vaccine for coronavirus â although there are many in development â and we
     do not have almost a century of experience in treating and managing
     coronavirus."" Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there have beenmore than twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than flu and pneumonia in Wales up to the end of August. Merthyr Tydfil, which had the highest rates in the UK just over a week ago, has now halved its rates to around 330 cases per 100,000 people, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said other areas of the south Wales valleys, including Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent, which had also had high rates, had seen their rates fall to fewer than 300 cases per 100,000. He said the ""autumn wave"" of cases had been sharply rising since the end of August and had been so much higher than in the spring because of the availability of mass testing in the community. ""In the spring, we were only able to test people
in hospitals and care homes,"" he told the press briefing. The downward trend for cases in Wales is continuing to fall, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has told the coronavirus press briefing. He said the case rate in Wales was now 160 per 100,000 people, a reduction of 70 from a week ago. The latest figures on Covid-19 case rates suggest problems are easing in earlier hotspot areas of the south Wales Valleys. Merthyr Tydfil still has the highest cases per 100,000 people in Wales but it has fallen to 336.5 from a peak of 679 at the end of October. Infections amongst students have dropped in Cardiff, helping to reduce the city's case rate considerably. Public Health Wales (PHW) is still reporting deaths at a daily average of 22 across the country. We can use different measures for looking at deaths over the pandemic in Wales. The total according to PHW - counting only confirmed cases, mostly in hospitals - is 2,207. When measures of registered deaths, used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are used, the figures are higher. This includes 2,345 excess deaths - these are the deaths above and beyond what  we would expect to see so far this year, compared to a five-year average. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is starting his first day working in self-isolation from Downing Street after having contact with a Conservative MP who later tested positive for Covid. The PM said he felt ""great"". Ina video on Monday,external, Mr Johnson urged others to ""follow the rules"" if contacted by NHS Test and Trace. On Thursday, Mr Johnson spent about 35 minutes with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who lost his sense of taste the next day. The BBC has been told the prime minister was contacted by a clinician at NHS Test and Trace, who had spoken to Mr Anderson about his movements and decided their meeting counted as close enough contact to require self-isolation. Mr Johnson, who wasadmitted to intensive carewith coronavirus seven months ago, has maintained the pair followed all social distancing advice during the appointment. Four other Tory MPs - South Ribble MP Katherine Fletcher, Warrington South MP Andy Carter, Great Grimsby MP Lia Nici and Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith - are also isolating following the meeting. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also spoke at Friday's briefing The briefing is being headed by Health Minister Vaughan Gething, who will speak from 12:15 GMT.

People 'don't feel entitled to mental health help'A woman urges people to seek help after the father of her children took his own life in July.,"This video can not be played Rainbow says Carl always had a smile for everyone, even when he was at his ""lowest ebb"" People struggling with their mental health during the pandemic ""do not feel entitled to seek help"" while others suffer with Covid-19, a charity said. A Mind Cymru survey of 900 people found a third of adults and a quarter of young people fail to get help because they did not think they deserved it. The charity said conditions had become ""more acute but also more complex"". A woman from Newport has urged people to ask for help after the father of her children took his own life in July. Rainbow, pictured with daughter Holli, says Carl ""struggled to talk"" Carl Morgan took his own life, aged 43, and Rainbow Chicharro said he ""struggled to talk"". She added: ""You would never have known Carl was suffering on the inside because even when he was at his lowest ebb, he would always have a smile for everybody. ""He would always put everybody else first before himself. His energy was infectious and whenever we had a gathering he was always the loudest and brightest of the bunch. It's really sad."" Mental health issues 'rise' during Wales lockdown BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' Children's mental health 'collateral damage' Their eight-year-old daughter Holli has raised thousands of pounds for charity by having her hair cut off on the date of her father's birthday. She said her favourite things to do with her father were ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did because I got to spend time with my dad"". ""It would always make him smile and we would always have so much fun,"" said Holli. She explained she wants to raise awareness so people ""don't have to suffer anymore"". Holli said she enjoyed ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did"" with her dad Mental health charity Mind Cymru has warned of the effects of the pandemic on people's mental health and on people's willingness to seek help. ""People haven't been seeking help for a number of reasons, fear of contracting the virus, but also maybe not feeling they deserve help at that time,"" said Simon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru. ""You may feel that how you're feeling emotionally isn't as important as the physical challenges that people are facing, but we know in the long run it's really important that people talk, and that people still seek help, because your mental health is as important as your physical health."" Figures published earlier in the year suggestedtwice as many adults had reported symptoms of depressioncompared with the same time last year. A survey of more than 3,500 adults found almost one in five appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with just under one in ten before the pandemic.

Johnson feeling 'great' as self-isolation begins,"Downing Street says the prime minister and MP Lee Anderson were standing ""side by side"" and observed guidelines and distancing advice during their meeting with on Thursday Boris Johnson, six Tory MPs and two political aides are self-isolating after a breakfast meeting inside Downing Street last Thursday. One of the MPs, Lee Anderson, later tested positive for Covid-19, and on Sunday the prime minister was told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Ina video from No 10,external, Mr Johnson urged others to ""follow the rules"" if contacted by the system. The PM's official spokesman insisted that Downing Street is ""Covid-secure"". He said ""social distancing did happen"" but factors such as the length of the meeting were considered by Test and Trace. Mr Johnson, who wasadmitted to intensive carewith coronavirus seven months ago, spent about 35 minutes with Mr Anderson - who lost his sense of taste the day after the meeting. The five other MPs self-isolating following the meeting with ""Red Wall""  Tories include: Heywood & Middleton MPChris Clarkson South Ribble MPKatherine Fletcher Warrington South MPAndy Carter Great Grimsby MPLia Nici Bassetlaw MPBrendan Clarke-Smith Mr Johnson's spokesman declined to name the aides but suggested they were not Lee Cain or Dominic Cummings,who left Downing Street last week. Jacob Young, MP for Redcar, is also self-isolating - but said he was not at the meeting - while Basingstoke MP Maria Miller has said she is self-isolating after having been contacted by Test and Trace. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was right to self-isolate as ""it is important for all of us to say that we have got to comply with the advice and guidance"".

The PM's period of isolation began as the government prepares a policy relaunch. Downing Street said a series of ""critical announcements"" would this week detail Mr Johnson's ""ambitions for the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson will chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". The prime minister had been expected to lead a No 10 news conference on Monday but Health Secretary Matt Hancock took his place. However, Mr Johnson is hoping to take part in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons virtually, Downing Street said. How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said the prime minister's self-isolation would make no difference to the amount of work he would be able to do ""driving forward the agenda"". Asked if the PM and Mr Anderson followed social distancing rules during their meeting, he said there were rules ""around Downing Street being a Covid-secure workplace"". He added: ""The central point is that it doesn't matter who you are, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate that is what you must do."" Photos of Mr Johnson and several Tory MPs show them standing close together. The prime minister had to self-isolate after one of them, Mr Anderson, developed Covid symptoms. Guidelines for offices require social distancing of 2m (6ft), or 1m plus precautions such as frequent cleaning and one-way systems where that is not possible. No 10 is yet to respond to a request from BBC Reality Check for details of the Covid-secure guidelines in Downing Street. But the PM's spokesman said ""social distancing did happen"" and that the picture shows Mr Johnson and Mr Anderson ""stood side-by-side, rather than face-to-face"". However, Test and Trace guidance defines a close contact as someone you spent more than 15 minutes with at a distance of under 2m. Mr Johnson's meeting with Mr Anderson lasted about 35 minutes and he would therefore be required to self-isolate if they were not more than 2m apart. In his video posted on Twitter, the PM said: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace is working ever-more efficiently, but the bad news is that they've pinged me and I've got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid. ""It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great. ""And actually, it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies. We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace."" According to No 10, the prime minister has had at least one antibody test for coronavirus. It remains unclear what effect, if any, previously having the coronavirus has on a person's immunity but experts think reinfection is likely to be rare,BBC health correspondent James Gallagher has reported. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said there have been more than 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reinfection globally. He added: ""I think most of us think the rate of reinfection is quite a lot higher than that, but not enormous."" Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14 day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? On Thursday, Mr Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield, posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM.""

Why does PM have to self-isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

How to avoid Covid indoors,"With social distancing restrictions ending in England and easing further in Scotland on 19 July, good ventilation will remain very important in avoiding Covid. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat the virus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According toworkplace regulations set up before the pandemic,external, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, saysDr Hywel Davies,external, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. A split air conditioner In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. Astudy of a restaurant in China,externalblamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. A rooftop air conditioning unit There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections. Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences."" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

"Astronaut crew launch to space stationA team of four leaves Florida on a SpaceX rocket and capsule, bound for the orbiting laboratory.Science & EnvironmentComments","This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Four astronauts - three from the US and one from Japan - have launched from Florida on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew rode to orbit in a rocket and capsule provided by the SpaceX company. It's only the second time the firm has supplied the service. The US space agency Nasa has said it is now entering a new era in which routine astronaut journeys to low-Earth orbit are being conducted by commercial providers. The four individuals making their way up to the ISS are the Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. By participating in this mission, Noguchi becomes only the third person in history to leave Earth in three different types of space vehicle, having previously flown on Soyuz and shuttle hardware. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? How astronaut transportation went commercial Orbital apparel: Evolution of the spacesuit The traditional ""walk-out"": The suited crew waved to family and friends The crew's Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule left the pad at the Kennedy Space Center at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It took 12 minutes for the Falcon to get the Dragon into the right part of the sky and drop it off. ""Well done, that was one heck of a ride,"" crew commander Mike Hopkins radioed down to controllers. ""Congratulations to everyone. Resilience is in orbit."" ""Resilience"" is the name the astronauts have given their capsule. The ship will use its own thrusters to complete the rest of the journey up to the station. A docking with the orbiting platform is set for about 0400 GMT on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the team arrives, it will join Nasa's Kate Rubins and Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Having seven people on the 410km-high outpost will triple the amount of science that can be performed in its special microgravity environment. The crew was driven down to the launch pad in a convoy of Tesla electric cars SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company rana demonstration mission in Mayin which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth. The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. ""The big milestone here is that we are now moving away from development and test and into operational flights. And in fact this operational flight was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. So this is a truly a commercial launch,"" commented Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is more than a year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit is saving billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions. To that end, Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024, or soon after. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: A guide Hopkins, Glover, Walker and Noguchi will stay on the ISS for six months. Just before they return to Earth, they'll be joined aloft by another SpaceX-launched crew for a brief handover. Indeed, the coming year is going to be very busy for the Californian service provider with plenty of trips up to the station being made by both its crewed and cargo-only versions of Dragon. ""In the next 15 months, we should be flying roughly seven Dragon missions. And this mission represents the initiation of a Dragon in orbit continuously - knocking on wood - and certainly is really the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight,"" said SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. The company president was in attendance at Kennedy, carrying out media duties in place of founder and CEO Elon Musk who is said to be suffering a mild case of Covid. A dramatic shot of the Merlin engines firing at the base of the Falcon rocket Nasa retired its winged space shuttles in 2011. In the intervening years, it's been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz vehicles. This purchase option will now close in favour of the new American-sourced taxis. But US astronauts will continue to go to the station on Soyuz from time to time - it's just that no money will change hands. Instead, Russian cosmonauts will get flights in the American capsules in exchange. Soichi Noguchi has now flown in a SpaceX Dragon, a Soyuz capsule and a space shuttle The new crew will have at least four spacewalks to perform in their time at the station. In one of those walks, they will install the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is theColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS research module, Columbus. The UK participates on the station through its membership of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that is a separate legal entity to the European Union. Will the UK have a seat on a space taxi? Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency The UK participates in the International Space Station, because the UK Space Agency exploration programme is part of the European Space Agency programme. We already have British scientists who are able to use the facilities on the ISS. And there are some experiments in development now to be carried out aboard the space station in the coming years. One, called the BioAsteroid project, run by the University of Edinburgh, will investigate how gravity affects the interaction between microbes and rock in reduced gravity. Astronauts on these space taxis will be taking these UK-led experiments to and from the space station. And much of the science can actually be operated remotely from the ground. We may well also see British astronauts flying on this vehicle in the future, too.

Johnson feeling 'great' as self-isolation beginsThe PM and five Tory MPs have been told to self-isolate by Test and Trace after a No 10 meeting.UKComments,"Downing Street says the prime minister and MP Lee Anderson were standing ""side by side"" and observed guidelines and distancing advice during their meeting with on Thursday Boris Johnson, six Tory MPs and two political aides are self-isolating after a breakfast meeting inside Downing Street last Thursday. One of the MPs, Lee Anderson, later tested positive for Covid-19, and on Sunday the prime minister was told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Ina video from No 10,external, Mr Johnson urged others to ""follow the rules"" if contacted by the system. The PM's official spokesman insisted that Downing Street is ""Covid-secure"". He said ""social distancing did happen"" but factors such as the length of the meeting were considered by Test and Trace. Mr Johnson, who wasadmitted to intensive carewith coronavirus seven months ago, spent about 35 minutes with Mr Anderson - who lost his sense of taste the day after the meeting. The five other MPs self-isolating following the meeting with ""Red Wall""  Tories include: Heywood & Middleton MPChris Clarkson South Ribble MPKatherine Fletcher Warrington South MPAndy Carter Great Grimsby MPLia Nici Bassetlaw MPBrendan Clarke-Smith Mr Johnson's spokesman declined to name the aides but suggested they were not Lee Cain or Dominic Cummings,who left Downing Street last week. Jacob Young, MP for Redcar, is also self-isolating - but said he was not at the meeting - while Basingstoke MP Maria Miller has said she is self-isolating after having been contacted by Test and Trace. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was right to self-isolate as ""it is important for all of us to say that we have got to comply with the advice and guidance"".

The PM's period of isolation began as the government prepares a policy relaunch. Downing Street said a series of ""critical announcements"" would this week detail Mr Johnson's ""ambitions for the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson will chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". The prime minister had been expected to lead a No 10 news conference on Monday but Health Secretary Matt Hancock took his place. However, Mr Johnson is hoping to take part in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons virtually, Downing Street said. How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said the prime minister's self-isolation would make no difference to the amount of work he would be able to do ""driving forward the agenda"". Asked if the PM and Mr Anderson followed social distancing rules during their meeting, he said there were rules ""around Downing Street being a Covid-secure workplace"". He added: ""The central point is that it doesn't matter who you are, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate that is what you must do."" Photos of Mr Johnson and several Tory MPs show them standing close together. The prime minister had to self-isolate after one of them, Mr Anderson, developed Covid symptoms. Guidelines for offices require social distancing of 2m (6ft), or 1m plus precautions such as frequent cleaning and one-way systems where that is not possible. No 10 is yet to respond to a request from BBC Reality Check for details of the Covid-secure guidelines in Downing Street. But the PM's spokesman said ""social distancing did happen"" and that the picture shows Mr Johnson and Mr Anderson ""stood side-by-side, rather than face-to-face"". However, Test and Trace guidance defines a close contact as someone you spent more than 15 minutes with at a distance of under 2m. Mr Johnson's meeting with Mr Anderson lasted about 35 minutes and he would therefore be required to self-isolate if they were not more than 2m apart. In his video posted on Twitter, the PM said: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace is working ever-more efficiently, but the bad news is that they've pinged me and I've got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid. ""It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great. ""And actually, it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies. We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace."" According to No 10, the prime minister has had at least one antibody test for coronavirus. It remains unclear what effect, if any, previously having the coronavirus has on a person's immunity but experts think reinfection is likely to be rare,BBC health correspondent James Gallagher has reported. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said there have been more than 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reinfection globally. He added: ""I think most of us think the rate of reinfection is quite a lot higher than that, but not enormous."" Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14 day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? On Thursday, Mr Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield, posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" On Sunday, he posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable, after they both tested positive. The PMwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night that he had been notified by NHS Test and Trace that he must self-isolate as he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, and he would be working from No 10.

High schools and colleges are to halt on-site teaching while restaurants are prohibited from offering indoor dining in Michigan from Wednesday. Indoor restaurant dining is also banned in Washington State, and gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums will close. And much of California will return to its most severe restriction level. On average, more than 1,000 people a day are dying with the virus, and the overall death toll is close to 250,000. Hospital admissions have also reached record levels with nearly 150,000 new cases across the US on Monday. The Trump administration struck an optimistic note on Friday, saying it hoped to distribute 20 million doses of an approved vaccine in December, and for each month after that - although vaccines have yet to get official approval. These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases Is this Covid wave in US the worst yet? President-elect Joe Bidensaid on Monday that ""people may die""because of the White House's refusal to facilitate a presidential transition and co-ordinate with the Biden team for a vaccination campaign. The lack of cooperation is ""totally irresponsible"", he said. On Monday, in a major new development,US drug company Moderna said its Covid-19 vaccine was nearly 95% effective according to early results. A similar announcement earlier this month about another vaccine - from the companies Pfizer and BioNTech - sent stock markets soaring amid hopes that life could return to normal next year. Mr Biden celebrated the developments, but cautioned that distributing a vaccine to Americans is ""a huge, huge, undertaking"". Even without coordination between the president and the president-elect, aides to Mr Biden have said his team would nonetheless start talking to vaccine manufacturers. President Donald Trump on Monday celebrated the news and appeared to claim credit for the vaccine progress, writing on Twitter that these ""great developments...all took place on my watch"". Mr Trump has ruled out putting the nation into lockdown, but many states are introducing their own restrictions as fast rising cases threaten to overwhelm their healthcare systems. Michigan, Washington State and California have seen Covid cases double in recent weeks. Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the state was ""at the precipice"" and could soon suffer 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths a week unless action is taken. As well as suspending in-person teaching and indoor dining,Ms Whitmer also ordered the closure of public entertainment venues for a period of three weeks,external. This video can not be played Fauci: ""We have got to double down"" to fight Covid Thecurbs announced in Washington State,externalcome into effect on Monday evening and will last a month. ""Today, Sunday, November 15, 2020, is the most dangerous public health day in the last 100 years of our state's history,"" Governor Jay Inslee said. ""A pandemic is raging in our state. Left unchecked, it will assuredly result in grossly overburdened hospitals and morgues; and keep people from obtaining routine but necessary medical treatment for non-Covid conditions."" On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was pulling the ""emergency brake"", bringing more than 94% of the population under the strictest coronavirus guidance. In these counties, indoor restaurant spaces, worship spaces and gyms will be closed. Mr Newsom said he is also considering a state curfew to help slow the spread. He also apologised on Monday for his ""bad mistake"" in attending a lobbyist's birthday party that violated his own coronavirus-prevention rules. It emerged on Friday that he and his wife attended the celebration on 6 November at a Michelin-starred restaurant in wine country near San Francisco. ""The spirit of what I'm preaching all the time was contradicted,"" Mr Newsom said. ""I need to preach and practise, not just preach."" California on Friday became the second state, after Texas, to hit one million Covid cases, prompting local officials to hit pause on reopening efforts. In other developments: Oregon and New Mexico brought in tighter restrictionson Saturday. Republican governors inIowa,Ohio, West Virginia,UtahandNorth Dakotaissued mask mandates Ohio'sgovernor threatened to shut bars and gyms if the outbreak worsens InMinnesota, bars and restaurants must shut by 22:00 local time WisconsinandNevadaresidents were asked to stay at home for two weeks to avoid a return to restrictions The Democratic governors ofCalifornia, OregonandWashington Stateissued a travel advisory, discouraging non-essential travel and requesting people to quarantine post-travel New Yorkordered bars and restaurants that serve alcohol to close by 22:00 local time; gatherings are limited to 10 people; public schools on Monday remained open, but possible closures still loom The city ofChicagohas a stay-at-home advisory, and non-essential businesses must close by 23:00  local time; gatherings are limited to 10 people The city ofDetroitmoved all students to remote learning due to the virus spikes Indianahalted reopening and limited social gatherings and events Marylandordered restaurants to reduce indoor capacity to 50% Outbreaks in the spring and summer followed US schools' spring breaks and the national Labor Day holiday weekend - and now experts are concerned that as Thanksgiving approaches on 26 November, the spikes will again worsen. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump on Covid-19 in his own words That is the situation playing out across the border in Canada, where people celebrated their Thanksgiving a month ago. The country's top doctors say that the holiday is partly why cities and provinces are now seeing record infections. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Is the Covid vaccine safe for me? And other questions Data shows,externalthat the majority of the US has rising ""community spread"" of the virus - situations where people get the virus without any known contact with a sick person. Indoor gatherings pose a large risk to spreading the virus, and as the holiday centres around eating together, wearing masks is not feasible. Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the state was ""at the precipice and we need to take some action"" One analysis,externalfrom Georgia Institute of Technology researchers found the risk of having a Covid-positive individual at even a gathering of 10 people could be close to 100% in the worst-hit parts of the US. Back in October, top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci cautioned that the ""sacred"" American tradition of gathering together at Thanksgiving was ""a risk"". ""You may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering, unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected,"" Dr Fauci told CBS News.

Major Covid vaccine trial starts in UK,"A major trial of a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 has launched in the UK - the third such trial in the country. The jab - designed by the Belgian company Janssen - uses a genetically modified common cold virus to train the immune system. It comes a week after preliminary results showed another vaccineoffered 90% protection. However, many types of vaccine are likely to be needed to end the pandemic. The success of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech has caused global excitement. However, it has not yet been approved for use and we still do not know how well it works in the elderly or how long immunity lasts. The hunt for Covid vaccines continues as a different approach may yet be better, or better in some age groups, and one company will struggle to immunise the planet. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? ""It is really important we pursue many different vaccines from many different manufactures,"" said Prof Saul Faust, the director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, who will run the trial. He added: ""We just don't know how each of these vaccines is going to behave and we can't be certain vaccine supply will be efficient and secure from one manufacturer."" The trial has started the job of recruiting 6,000 people in the UK. Other countries will join the effort to bring the total up to 30,000. Half of the volunteers will be given two doses of the vaccine around two months apart. Janssen already has one large scale trial of its vaccine in which volunteers get one dose. This trial will see if two gives a stronger and longer lasting immunity. It could take six to nine months before the results are available. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means Hopes for the Janssen vaccine have been buoyed by Pfizer's preliminary data as they both target a part of the virus called the spike protein. The seemingly successful jab injected part of the virus' genetic code into volunteers. The Janssen vaccine instead uses a common cold virus that has been genetically modified to make it harmless and to look more like coronavirus at a molecular level. This should train the immune system to recognise and fight coronavirus. This approach is similar to the vaccine designed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, which is also being trialled in the UK. The subtle difference is the Janssen vaccine uses a virus that normally infects people and the Oxford group are using one that infects chimpanzees. But all these approaches are relatively new and experimental. The Novavax jab, which uses the more traditional method of injecting viral proteins to train the body,started in September in the UK. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? In total 25,000 people are already taking part in Covid trials in the UK. The UK government has already put in advanced orders for six Covid vaccines, including 30 million doses of the Janssen jab. Kate Bingham, the chairwoman of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said: ""Many vaccines are needed both here in the UK, and globally, to ensure we can provide a safe and effective vaccine for the whole population. ""That is why the launch of this trial to establish the safety, effectiveness, and very importantly the durability, of the Janssen vaccine is so significant, and I would continue to encourage people to sign up and take part in vaccine trials.""

Working from home 'could lead to more prejudice',"Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests. Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"". He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations. The study, conducted by polling company Survation for theWoolf Institute,external, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people. Home working here to stay, say businesses Bad backs and wobbly tables: 'I hate working from home' Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities. ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced. The study also examined people's opinions on diversity. Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person. ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The report also indicates that a majority of Muslims were themselves uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish or Sikh person, or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person. ""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said. The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known asMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP),external, which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added. Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique calledMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).,external MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities.

'Hero' doctor treated after hospital blaze,"Dr Catalin Denciu is being treated for second to third degree burns A Romanian doctor who suffered severe burns after trying to save Covid-19 patients from a hospital fire has been taken to Belgium for treatment. Dr Catalin Denciu was called ""heroic"" by PM Ludovic Orban, who praised his ""particular courage and spirit of sacrifice"" trying to save the patients. Ten patients died in the blaze at the hospital in Piatra Neamt on Saturday. An inquiry has been launched into how the deadly fire broke out in the public hospital's intensive care unit. The fire also spread to an adjoining room. Some reports suggest a medical appliance caught fire, igniting a nearby oxygen cylinder. Regional officials say the unit was moved from the third floor of the hospital to the second without official notification. The blaze on Saturday evening ripped through the intensive care unit at the hospital Austria locks down as new wave grips Europe How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Seven men and three women, aged between 67 and 86, died in the fire. Six other Covid-19 patients injured in the fire were transferred to another hospital in the city of Iasi. Dr Denciu was transferred to Belgium's Queen Astrid military hospital, having been taken to the capital Bucharest after suffering second to third degree burns to 40% of his body, officials said. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called it a ""huge tragedy"" and said it was important to find out what had happened ""in order to avoid similar situations in future"". Romania has reported more than 360,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and nearly 9,000 deaths. Nearly 13,000 Covid-19 patients were in hospital across Romania as of Sunday, including 1,169 in intensive care units, Reuters news agency reports.

PM 'confident we will prosper' without EU deal,"Boris Johnson says the UK will ""prosper"" without a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU Boris Johnson has reiterated he is ""confident [the UK] will prosper"" outside the EU if a post-Brexit trade deal is not agreed with the bloc. Talks began again in Brussels on Monday, with the UK's chief negotiator saying there had been ""progress"". Lord David Frost told reporters: ""We're working very hard to get a deal but there's quite a lot to do."" His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said he wanted ""future cooperation to be open but fair"" with the UK. Tweeting,externalas talks started, he added: ""We remain determined, patient, respectful."" Sticking points between the two sides focus on competition rules and state aid for businesses, as well as fishing rights. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said there was still a ""very, very wide gap"" on fishing, with no progress on the issue since the summer. He told RTE: ""Until we can find a way of doing that, there isn't going to be an agreement."" Brexit trade sticking points 'can be resolved' What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year while negotiations take place. Any deal between the UK and EU would need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, so time is running out for an agreement to be reached and to get the sign off before 31 December. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs. The government was planning a policy re-launch this week after rows within Downing Street and departures of key members of staff - including Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. As part of its reset statement, No 10 said the talks this week would be ""crucial"". The statement added: ""The prime minister has been clear that we will not accept any proposals in the negotiations that undermine our status as a sovereign, independent country. ""If the EU don't respect the sovereignty of the UK, we will leave onAustralian termsand the prime minister is confident that we will prosper."" Mr Johnson is now having to self-isolate for 14-daysafter meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. But in a video made by Downing Street, he said he was ""in good health"", ""had no symptoms"", and would ""continue to lead"" from his flat. Government and EU officials describe this negotiating week as ""crucial"". Time really is running out now. The standstill transition period, which followed Brexit in January, stops at the end of next month. By then, not only does a deal need to have been agreed, but also ratified by parliament in the UK and the EU. Chief UK negotiator David Frost said on Sunday that some progress had been made of late, but that considerable differences remained. He said he'd only agree to a deal that respected UK sovereignty and a no deal outcome was still possible. To avoid that, the government and the EU know they will have to compromise. ""This is move week,"" proclaimed Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. But who's going to move first? And are both sides prepared to concede enough to clinch a deal? Meanwhile, the chief executive of the British Ports Association said his industry has found it ""agonising"" to get some of the information from the government about the infrastructure they will need to function after the transition period ends. Giving evidence to the Lords' EU Goods Sub-Committee, Richard Ballantyne said leaving without a trade deal could make it ""completely impossible"" to accommodate animal and plant products coming into the country. He added: ""It would basically put traders at a real disadvantage bringing their goods in to certain routes and gateways if they know that a high percentage of those volumes need to be opened and inspected.""

Two new Covid testing 'mega labs' in early 2021,"Two new ""mega labs"" will open in early 2021 with the aim of doubling the UK's daily coronavirus testing capacity, the government has said. The sites - at Leamington Spa in the Midlands and another at an unconfirmed site in Scotland - will increase testing capacity by 600,000. The latest data shows,externalcurrent capacity is around 519,000 - although the number of tests actually processed is lower. Meanwhile, Labour is calling for a national plan to roll out the vaccine. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccination programme will probably be the largest logistical operation since World War Two - and called for a plan setting out who will be eligible for a jab and when. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Coronavirus testing explained Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but the government's system has experienced setbacks during the pandemic. In recent weeks, the governmenthas started to pilot mass testing- including people with no symptoms - using a new type of rapid swab tests which do not need to be sent to a lab. However, the bulk of the UK's testing still uses the standard swab test that need to be analysed in a lab. Announcing the two new ""mega labs"", the government said they will use technology to speed up the process - for example through automation and robotics. ""This means more tests will be processed more quickly and at a lower cost, and therefore faster turnaround times for test results,"" the Department of Health said. The sites will create up to 4,000 jobs, with the labs also being used to process tests for other illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. They would each add 300,000 to the UK's daily testing capacity - defined as how many tests can be processed in the lab each day - when operating at maximum. The testing capacity is different to how many tests are actually processed. For example, the latest figures for Friday showed that although the UK's capacity was 519,951, the number of tests carried out was 379,955. Officialshave previously saidit is natural that not all the capacity is used up, and there needs to be flexibility in the system to cope with surges in demand or problems with equipment or staff. On the face of it the planned new ""mega labs"" will mark a significant boost to UK testing capacity. The current capability of 500,000 tests a day will be more than doubled when the two labs are up and running. But the big unanswered question is when? The timing is vague with only an aim for an opening early next year. The site for the Scottish lab has not yet been announced. Previous pledges on testing capacity have not always been met. A new ""lighthouse lab"" at Charnwood in the East Midlands was due to open in early October. That didn't happen although government sources say it will come online ""in the coming months"" along with three others. Plans are one thing. Delivery is another. More details of the ""mega labs"" will be closely scrutinised when they are published. ""We didn't go into this crisis with a significant diagnostics industry, but we have built one, and these two mega labs are another step forward,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""These mega labs are future-proofing our national infrastructure to respond to future epidemics and improving care for other diseases."" The Scotland lab - which will be rolled out after Leamington Spa - will create about 1,800 jobs, the Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said. Its location is yet to be confirmed. She described the establishment of the mega lab as ""an important step in our fight against the virus"" that will ""significantly"" increase testing and diagnostic capacity. Ms Freeman added: ""The facility, which will follow on from the lab in Leamington Spa, will also have the flexibility to provide diagnostic capability in the future for other diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and will support Scotland's growing precision medicine industry."" Separately,the NHS announced,externalit is launching 40 clinics specialising in ""long Covid"" which will start opening at the end of November. The condition is thought to affect more than 60,000 people in the UK. Meanwhile, hope continues that a Covid vaccine will be rolled out in coming months. At the weekend, the co-founder of pharmaceutical company BioNTech, whose vaccine with Pfizer has shown positive early results, said life should be back to normal by next winter. Prof Ugur Sahin saidif everything continued to go well, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"". This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" Labour's Sir Keir has called on Boris Johnson to publish a national action plan for rolling out a vaccine ""that harnesses all of the talents of the British people: our businesses, nurses, doctors, scientists and public servants"". He said the government should consider supporting councils to refurbish town halls or sport centres into local vaccine clinics, and also launch a nationwide public health campaign to crack down on vaccine fake news. ""We are world leaders in vaccines, and I believe we should be aiming for a world class programme for rolling it out,"" he said. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Last week, BioNTech and Pfizer became the first vaccine developers to share preliminary analysis that showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. Their vaccine is one of 11 in the final stages of testing. However, there is no data yet to show how well the jab works in the elderly, and it is also not known if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick. The UK has ordered enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Theagency's head has saidit would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the UK's number of people who have died to 51,934.

Romania 'hero' doctor treated in Belgium for burns,"Dr Catalin Denciu is being treated for second to third degree burns A Romanian doctor who suffered severe burns after trying to save Covid-19 patients from a hospital fire has been taken to Belgium for treatment. Dr Catalin Denciu was called ""heroic"" by PM Ludovic Orban, who praised his ""particular courage and spirit of sacrifice"" trying to save the patients. Ten patients died in the blaze at the hospital in Piatra Neamt on Saturday. An inquiry has been launched into how the deadly fire broke out in the public hospital's intensive care unit. The fire also spread to an adjoining room. Some reports suggest a medical appliance caught fire, igniting a nearby oxygen cylinder. Regional officials say the unit was moved from the third floor of the hospital to the second without official notification. The blaze on Saturday evening ripped through the intensive care unit at the hospital Austria locks down as new wave grips Europe How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Seven men and three women, aged between 67 and 86, died in the fire. Six other Covid-19 patients injured in the fire were transferred to another hospital in the city of Iasi. Dr Denciu was transferred to Belgium's Queen Astrid military hospital, having been taken to the capital Bucharest after suffering second to third degree burns to 40% of his body, officials said. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called it a ""huge tragedy"" and said it was important to find out what had happened ""in order to avoid similar situations in future"". Romania has reported more than 360,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and nearly 9,000 deaths. Nearly 13,000 Covid-19 patients were in hospital across Romania as of Sunday, including 1,169 in intensive care units, Reuters news agency reports.

Covid insurance test case heads to Supreme Court,"A hotly-contested case about insurance payouts for small businesses who were unable to trade owing to lockdown heads to the Supreme Court on Monday. A host of businesses closed or faced significant losses, so made claims on their business interruption insurance. But many insurers disputed the claims, arguing policies were never meant to cover such unprecedented restrictions. Supreme Court judges will make a final judgement after the hearing, which is expected to last four days. The issue will have had implications for 370,000 - mostly small - businesses, and involves potential payouts of Â£1.2bn. High Court judges earlier found mostly in favour of insurers having to pay out to policyholders regarding a selection of policy types. Some of these decisions are now being appealed against at the Supreme Court. Many thousands of businesses could not operate during the first national lockdown because, for example, they were unable to enter their premises. Anna Smart and her husband Robin had to relocate to their back garden It meant some went out of business. Others - like Anna and Robin Smart's photography studio in Oxfordshire - had to downsize, make staff redundant, or relocate. The Smarts moved their studio into their back garden and said the whole situation caused ""immense stress"". They, like others, looked to their insurer for compensation via their business interruption insurance policies. Some businesses paid premiums of many thousands of pounds a year for such cover. Some insurers refused to pay out, in some cases because they said disease clauses in contracts did not cover such a scenario. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, brought a test case with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. This went to the High Court, where judges found that most, but not all, of the policies involved should pay out offering a potential lifeline to many of these small businesses. But many have still had to wait while the proceedings were fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court. The High Court looked at 21 policy types as part of a test case, and rulings on 13 have been appealed against. These will be discussed in complex legal arguments over four days at the Supreme Court. 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling Of these, the lower court said 11 should have led to payouts - decisions now being appealed against by insurers. Judges said two should not pay out, and these are the subject of appeal by the FCA. For two insurers, Zurich and Ecclesiastical, the judgement found entirely in their favour and the FCA decided not to appeal against the findings. The final ruling by the Supreme Court judges will provide authoritative guidance for the other policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. For example, the Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. The Supreme Court will give judgement some weeks after next week's hearing. The FCA will expect insurers to respond quickly to the final judgement, if the result means they are required to do so. Many businesses will have renewed annual policies since the first lockdown began and these will have Covid exclusions, so claims are mostly relevant for older policies during the first UK lockdown.

world today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our
teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Sophie Williams, Alice
Evans, Alexandra Fouche, Becky Morton, Max Matza and Doug Faulkner, and the
editors were Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley, Holly Wallis and Sarah Fowler We'll be pausing our live coverage for the evening shortly so here's a quick summary of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today:  No traces of coroanvirus have been found on trains used by Britain's largest rail franchise, it has said. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said checks on a random selection of carriages used by its Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern brands all returned negative results. The tests were carried out up to 23 days after surfaces frequently touched by passengers and staff were treated with an anti-viral disinfectant. The surfaces included grab rails, tables, toilet handles and door buttons. As well as long-lasting disinfectant, all 2,700 GTR carriages are sanitised overnight using short-term anti-viral sprays and an additional 100 cleaners have been deployed. A further 213 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19,according to figures from the UK government,external, bringing the country's total death toll to 52,147. And 21,363 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the past day. There have been 1,390,681 cases reported in the UK in total. Last week the UK became the first country in Europeto reach the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at the briefing about advice from the government modelling group SPI-M that suggested returning to the three-tiered system in December risked the R value rising again, and undoing any decline in the rate of new cases achieved during England's lockdown. Hancock responded that that was not what the scientific advice had said - that it wasnât just about the tiered system but âalso about what measures are in each tierâ. You can read the SPI-M advicehere,external. It says that what happens to the outbreak depends on what measures are taken after 2 December and that: âIf England returns to the same application of the tiering system in place before 5 November, then transmission will return to the same rate of increase as today.â But clearly that allows for the government to introduce a different application of the tiering system, having different restrictions in each of the tiers than it had before the second lockdown. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The head of the World Health Organization has warned against complacency in the fight against Covid-19, despite the news that some potential vaccines are showing very good results in testing. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus was surging in many parts of the world, and said countries letting it spread unchecked were playing with fire. The news that two vaccines being tested have shown a success rate of 90% or more have sent stock markets soaring, and sighs of relief rippling through governments. But today the WHO offered a reality check: it is likely to be months before vaccines are widely available, in the meantime Covid-19 is surging across Europe and North America. For now, there is no alternative to laborious testing, tracing and isolating. The WHO also wants to ensure vaccines are fairly distributed and has called on G20 leaders to commit to provide vaccines to poorer countries. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government is adamant that it wants Englandâs lockdown
to end on 2 December. But what replaces it is still very much a live discussion in
the corridors of power. There was always a question mark about how much infections
would fall during the lockdown. And clearly the impact has been undermined by the spike in
cases last week, when the daily number jumped by 10,000 to over 33,000 on
Thursday. That rise has been linked to a last bout of socialising
before the lockdown came in. The hope is cases will start falling this week. But it will take much longer for that to filter through into
fewer hospital cases. Hence the suggestion that the regional tiers may need to be
strengthened when lockdown ends. One idea is to create a new tier four, which would see much
tighter restrictions on hospitality opening. But do not expect an announcement soon. Ministers will want
to see exactly what happens to cases over the rest of the month. Dr Scott Atlas was accused of inciting political violence Dr Scott Atlas - a controversial radiologist, member of the White House coronavirus taskforce and a skeptic of virus mitigation efforts such as mask- wearing - has clarified a tweet from yesterday condemning the Michigan's governor's newest lockdown order. In his tweet, he objected to the Democratic governor's order to close many businesses and schools for three weeks amid a surge in new Covid cases. ""The only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept,"" he wrote. The Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was the subject of an alleged kidnapping attempt last month by militia members opposed to virus mitigation efforts. Michigan's state house has also been the scene of several major protests, including one where gun-carrying protesters attempted to storm the legislature. Amid an online backlash, Atlas responded: ""Hey. I NEVER was talking at all about violence. People vote, people peacefully protest. NEVER would I endorse or incite violence. NEVER!!"" Social distancing and mask wearing are recommended by health agencies around the world, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a way to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.

a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the
latest vaccine news has led to a resurgence. One false claim circulating is that a vaccine is a means of inserting
microchips into the population. Other popular, unsubstantiated
claims include the idea that a vaccine will be used to alter our DNA or even as
a weapon of genocide.Reality Check has debunked these claims. This kind of disinformation is a
world away from legitimate concerns about whether a vaccine is safe and
properly tested - concerns that were previously
raised in the US, for example, over fears that vaccine approvals could be rushed
through. Despite commitments to tackle
falsehoods from social media sites and the government, the constant swirl of
conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective
vaccine. The anti-vaccine movement, of course, pre-dates the pandemic -
perhaps because vaccinations have always involved a combination of science that
is difficult to understand, and emotive reactions, including worry, excitement,
and anxiety about being jabbed by a needle. But it is not the only thing responsible for the latest spread of
these conspiracy theories online. Pseudo-science figures with large
online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking
coronavirus to 5G  - have also turned their attention to vaccines. Have you seen suspect posts about
vaccines on your social media feeds? Get in touch -marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Jamie Kaffash, from primary care publication Pulse magazine, asks Matt Hancock if he can reassure GPs he will reduce their non-urgent workload to free up time for the Covid vaccination programme. The health secretary tells every GP that he is very grateful for the work they are doing on flu vaccines and on the ""normal pressures of primary care"". He says he hopes  a Covid vaccination programme will be ready to go, with 1 December the earliest the roll-out could begin. Jonathan Van-Tam says the roll-out is ""going to be biggest and most important thing NHS has done for a very long time"". He says he understands workload pressures but says it will be ""incumbent on all of us"" to make sure this programme moves as fast as it can with highest uptake possible. ""It is a big opportunity to change the way the pandemic will roll out over 2021,"" he says. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Will England come out of lockdown on December 2nd?
Boris Johnsonâs always been keen to emphasize that the rules legally expire on
that date. But Matt Hancock strikes a more cautious note, saying itâs too early
to be sure although itâs his âhopeâ that it will be time to go back into the
tiered system. This is a question that will need to be answered soon; MPs have
been told theyâll get a vote on what happens next before the month-long
lockdown is up. A journalist from the Independent asks Matt Hancock whether NHS staff are going to get an above-inflation pay rise. In reply, the health secretary says the government has already agreed a three-year pay deal for nurses. He says an independent pay review of NHS wages is ongoing - and he is ""not going to prejudge"" the results of that. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent It looks like some fervent
negotiations have been going on behind the scenes. Just a few hours ago, the government said it
was in advanced discussions with Moderna to gain access to the vaccine. Now
Matt Hancock has announced a preliminary deal for 5 million doses. Some Tory
MPs think ministers like Matt Hancock have pinned too much, in terms of their Covid
strategy, on the prospect of a vaccine but of course early results from Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna have raised many peopleâs
hopes that this could be crucial in helping the country emerge from
restrictions. Gordon Rayner from the Daily Telegraph asks if the 14-day isolation period may be reconsidered, particularly in light of the prime minister isolating despite ""bursting with antibodies"". Hancock says the prime minister going into self-isolation is a clear demonstration that everybody, no matter who you are, needs to follow the rules. He says they keep such things under review but are not in a position to make any changes. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock has
mentioned two new coronavirus testing âmega labsâ which he said could increase
testing capacity by 600,000 tests a day. But capacity does not mean actually
processing that many tests, just that there is the ability â in theory - to do
that many. For example, on 12 November, there was UK
lab capacity for 520,000 tests, but in reality 380,000 tests were processed. This means labs were running at about 73%
of capacity. The government says on an ideal day they will be working at 85% of capacity, to allow some room if there is a surge
in demand for tests.  There's another question from a journalist from Channel 5 about what measures could replace the England-wide lockdown in December, and whether a return to local tiers could increase infections. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says the tiered restrictions have had a ""different effect"" in each area. She says there is evidence that in tier two - the middle tier - restrictions ""hold in some areas, not so well in others"". She says the rules in tier one - the lowest Covid alert level - have had ""very little effect"" and may need to be ""strengthened"" to help the country ""get through the winter months"". Sky's Thomas Moore asks why the UK government has not bought up some of the Moderna vaccine before now. Matt Hancock says there is not a stockpile, the vaccine has not yet been manufactured and in Europe first availability will be in the spring. ""It is critical we have been buying the first vaccines that will be available,"" he says. He adds that, if you take the Astrazeneca agreements and Pfizer vaccines into account, the UK has more than 100 million doses on order. Jonathan Van-Tam says the spiked coronavirus protein is being targeted by most of the vaccine trials around the world and these early results are beginning to show us this is a ""plausible target for vaccines to be working against"". ""When we started this journey in February/March we didn't even know that, so we are in a happier place than we were,"" he says. BBC Medical Editor Fergus Walsh asks Matt Hancock if he ""regrets"" the UK has not signed a deal for more Moderna vaccine. The health secretary says this vaccine won't come in until the spring - but the UK has already got 40 million of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines on order, and they are likely to come on stream earlier. He adds though that neither is currently approved. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the UK has purchased vaccines across ""multiple targets"". Reaching for a football metaphor, he says that positive news on Moderna, following the encouraging news earlier this month from Pfizer, is the ""second penalty that has gone into the back of the net"". Diviya from Leicester asks if the national lockdown in England will be extended beyond 2 December if cases and deaths continue to rise. Matt Hancock says it is too early for us to know what the number of cases will be at the end of the current lockdown. He says: ""At the moment most of the tests we are getting back, most of the positive cases, are from around the time when the lockdown came in so it is too early to see in the data the impact of the second lockdown. ""But we absolutely hope to be able to replace the national lockdown with a tiered system similar to the one we had before."" But he says that is still being assessed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay'America faces a huge task in reversing a divisive conspiracy culture, Barack Obama tells the BBC.US Election 2020","This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics The US faces a huge task in reversing a culture of ""crazy conspiracy theories"" that have exacerbated divides in the country, Barack Obama says. In a BBC interview, the former president says the US is more sharply split than even four years ago, when Donald Trump won the presidency. And Mr Obama suggests Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 US election is just the start of repairing those divisions. ""It'll take more than one election to reverse those trends,"" he says. Tackling a polarised nation, he argues, cannot be left only to the decisions of politicians, but also requires both structural change and people listening to one another - agreeing on a ""common set of facts"" before arguing what to do about them. However he says he sees ""great hope"" in the ""sophisticated"" attitudes of the next generation, urging young people to ""cultivate that cautious optimism that the world can change"" and ""to be a part of that change"". Why Donald Trump lost US election results in maps and charts The great dividing line of this year's election Anger and resentment between rural and urban America, immigration, injustices like inequality and ""the kinds of crazy conspiracy theories - what some have called truth decay"" have been amplified by some US media outlets and ""turbocharged by social media"", Mr Obama tells historian David Olusoga, in an interview for BBC Arts to promote his new memoir. ""We are very divided right now, certainly more than we were when I first ran for office in 2007 and won the presidency in 2008,"" the former president says. He suggests that this is, in part, attributable to Mr Trump's willingness to ""fan division because it was good for his politics"". Something else that has contributed hugely to the issue, Mr Obama says, is the spread of misinformation online, where ""facts don't matter"". ""There are millions of people who subscribed to the notion that Joe Biden is a socialist, who subscribed to the notion that Hillary Clinton was part of an evil cabal that was involved in paedophile rings,"" he says. The example he uses here with Ms Clinton relates toa fake theory alleging that Democratic politicians were running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. ""I think at some point it's going to require a combination of regulation and standards within industries to get us back to the point where we at least recognise a common set of facts before we start arguing about what we should do about those facts."" Mr Obama has said that Joe Biden, who he is greeting here with a socially distant ""air elbow"", has ""all the qualities we need in a president right now"" Mr Obama says that while many conventional mainstream media outlets have embraced fact-checking in recent years in an effort to tackle the spread of misinformation online, it is often not enough because ""falsehoods had already circled the globe by the time truth got out of the gates"". He says division is also a result of socioeconomic factors such as increasing inequality and disparities between rural and urban America. Such issues, he adds, are ""paralleled in the UK and around the world"" with ""people feeling as if they're losing a grip on the ladder of economic advancement and so react and can be persuaded that it's this group's fault or that group's fault"". By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation reporter Viral conspiracy theories have been a staple feature of this year's US election - and a more mainstream school of thought during the Trump presidency. That's because online disinformation with conspiratorial undertones is no longer limited to the dark corners of the internet. It's promoted by prominent figures, with huge followings - like those in charge across the world, including in the White House. The polarised world of the internet - where everything is a matter of opinion rather than fact, and we choose our tribe - has created a fertile breeding ground for conspiracies and misinformation. An increasing number of people who use social media to do their own research come to misleading conclusions - these can be exacerbated by one-sided coverage of stories by partisan media. As Barack Obama points out, these falsehoods or misleading claims - especially when amplified by the media or public figures - prove to be much more popular than any debunk. The solution may not reside in just presenting the facts - as important as that remains. It's also about understanding why people turn to conspiracies online and how they were exposed to them repeatedly. I frequentlyspeak to victims of online conspiracy theoriesabout the damage they bring, and the divisions they cause. That has revealed how difficult and complex this damage is to undo. Mr Obama, who made history as America's first black president, says the issue of race has been ""one of the central fault lines in American history - our original sin"". The events that unfolded over the summer, including the death of George Floyd - a black man who died in police custody - and the response to his death from communities not just in the US but around the world, created moments of both despair and optimism, he says. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? ""Despair that the chronic lingering role of race and bias in our criminal justice system continues in such a blatant form... enormous optimism that you saw an outpouring of protest activism and interest that far exceeded anything we had seen previously - and was peaceful."" How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement It was important that the protests were multi-racial, he says, adding that the response was different to that of the killing in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager who was shot dead by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman was later cleared of the 17-year-old's murder in a high-profile criminal case. Mr Obama also mentions the fatal shooting in 2014 of 18-year-old unarmed black man Michael Brown, who was shot six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He says that while those incidents inflamed passions across America, stirring up debate over race and justice, there still appeared to be ""resistance among large portions of the white community to push back against the notion that this was more than just one incident or a case of bad apples"". ""What you saw this summer was some communities that had a very negligible black population, folks going out there and saying Black Lives Matter and embracing the notion that real change has to come."" Mr Obama was speaking ahead of the release of his new memoir, A Promised Land, which charts his rise to the US Senate and first term as president. Due for release on 17 November, it is the first of two books covering his time in the White House.

Dr Catalin Denciu was called ""heroic"" by PM Ludovic Orban, who praised his ""particular courage and spirit of sacrifice"" trying to save the patients. Ten patients died in the blaze at the hospital in Piatra Neamt on Saturday. An inquiry has been launched into how the deadly fire broke out in the public hospital's intensive care unit. The fire also spread to an adjoining room. Some reports suggest a medical appliance caught fire, igniting a nearby oxygen cylinder. Regional officials say the unit was moved from the third floor of the hospital to the second without official notification. The blaze on Saturday evening ripped through the intensive care unit at the hospital Austria locks down as new wave grips Europe How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Seven men and three women, aged between 67 and 86, died in the fire. Six other Covid-19 patients injured in the fire were transferred to another hospital in the city of Iasi. Dr Denciu was transferred to Belgium's Queen Astrid military hospital, having been taken to the capital Bucharest after suffering second to third degree burns to 40% of his body, officials said. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called it a ""huge tragedy"" and said it was important to find out what had happened ""in order to avoid similar situations in future"". Romania has reported more than 360,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and nearly 9,000 deaths.

Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay',"This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics The US faces a huge task in reversing a culture of ""crazy conspiracy theories"" that have exacerbated divides in the country, Barack Obama says. In a BBC interview, the former president says the US is more sharply split than even four years ago, when Donald Trump won the presidency. And Mr Obama suggests Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 US election is just the start of repairing those divisions. ""It'll take more than one election to reverse those trends,"" he says. Tackling a polarised nation, he argues, cannot be left only to the decisions of politicians, but also requires both structural change and people listening to one another - agreeing on a ""common set of facts"" before arguing what to do about them. However he says he sees ""great hope"" in the ""sophisticated"" attitudes of the next generation, urging young people to ""cultivate that cautious optimism that the world can change"" and ""to be a part of that change"". Why Donald Trump lost US election results in maps and charts The great dividing line of this year's election Anger and resentment between rural and urban America, immigration, injustices like inequality and ""the kinds of crazy conspiracy theories - what some have called truth decay"" have been amplified by some US media outlets and ""turbocharged by social media"", Mr Obama tells historian David Olusoga, in an interview for BBC Arts to promote his new memoir. ""We are very divided right now, certainly more than we were when I first ran for office in 2007 and won the presidency in 2008,"" the former president says. He suggests that this is, in part, attributable to Mr Trump's willingness to ""fan division because it was good for his politics"". Something else that has contributed hugely to the issue, Mr Obama says, is the spread of misinformation online, where ""facts don't matter"". ""There are millions of people who subscribed to the notion that Joe Biden is a socialist, who subscribed to the notion that Hillary Clinton was part of an evil cabal that was involved in paedophile rings,"" he says. The example he uses here with Ms Clinton relates toa fake theory alleging that Democratic politicians were running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. ""I think at some point it's going to require a combination of regulation and standards within industries to get us back to the point where we at least recognise a common set of facts before we start arguing about what we should do about those facts."" Mr Obama has said that Joe Biden, who he is greeting here with a socially distant ""air elbow"", has ""all the qualities we need in a president right now"" Mr Obama says that while many conventional mainstream media outlets have embraced fact-checking in recent years in an effort to tackle the spread of misinformation online, it is often not enough because ""falsehoods had already circled the globe by the time truth got out of the gates"". He says division is also a result of socioeconomic factors such as increasing inequality and disparities between rural and urban America. Such issues, he adds, are ""paralleled in the UK and around the world"" with ""people feeling as if they're losing a grip on the ladder of economic advancement and so react and can be persuaded that it's this group's fault or that group's fault"". By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation reporter Viral conspiracy theories have been a staple feature of this year's US election - and a more mainstream school of thought during the Trump presidency. That's because online disinformation with conspiratorial undertones is no longer limited to the dark corners of the internet. It's promoted by prominent figures, with huge followings - like those in charge across the world, including in the White House. The polarised world of the internet - where everything is a matter of opinion rather than fact, and we choose our tribe - has created a fertile breeding ground for conspiracies and misinformation. An increasing number of people who use social media to do their own research come to misleading conclusions - these can be exacerbated by one-sided coverage of stories by partisan media. As Barack Obama points out, these falsehoods or misleading claims - especially when amplified by the media or public figures - prove to be much more popular than any debunk. The solution may not reside in just presenting the facts - as important as that remains. It's also about understanding why people turn to conspiracies online and how they were exposed to them repeatedly. I frequentlyspeak to victims of online conspiracy theoriesabout the damage they bring, and the divisions they cause. That has revealed how difficult and complex this damage is to undo. Mr Obama, who made history as America's first black president, says the issue of race has been ""one of the central fault lines in American history - our original sin"". The events that unfolded over the summer, including the death of George Floyd - a black man who died in police custody - and the response to his death from communities not just in the US but around the world, created moments of both despair and optimism, he says. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? ""Despair that the chronic lingering role of race and bias in our criminal justice system continues in such a blatant form... enormous optimism that you saw an outpouring of protest activism and interest that far exceeded anything we had seen previously - and was peaceful."" How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement It was important that the protests were multi-racial, he says, adding that the response was different to that of the killing in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager who was shot dead by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman was later cleared of the 17-year-old's murder in a high-profile criminal case. Mr Obama also mentions the fatal shooting in 2014 of 18-year-old unarmed black man Michael Brown, who was shot six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He says that while those incidents inflamed passions across America, stirring up debate over race and justice, there still appeared to be ""resistance among large portions of the white community to push back against the notion that this was more than just one incident or a case of bad apples"". ""What you saw this summer was some communities that had a very negligible black population, folks going out there and saying Black Lives Matter and embracing the notion that real change has to come."" Mr Obama was speaking ahead of the release of his new memoir, A Promised Land, which charts his rise to the US Senate and first term as president. Due for release on 17 November, it is the first of two books covering his time in the White House.

People 'don't feel entitled to mental health help',"This video can not be played Rainbow says Carl always had a smile for everyone, even when he was at his ""lowest ebb"" People struggling with their mental health during the pandemic ""do not feel entitled to seek help"" while others suffer with Covid-19, a charity said. A Mind Cymru survey of 900 people found a third of adults and a quarter of young people fail to get help because they did not think they deserved it. The charity said conditions had become ""more acute but also more complex"". A woman from Newport has urged people to ask for help after the father of her children took his own life in July. Rainbow, pictured with daughter Holli, says Carl ""struggled to talk"" Carl Morgan took his own life, aged 43, and Rainbow Chicharro said he ""struggled to talk"". She added: ""You would never have known Carl was suffering on the inside because even when he was at his lowest ebb, he would always have a smile for everybody. ""He would always put everybody else first before himself. His energy was infectious and whenever we had a gathering he was always the loudest and brightest of the bunch. It's really sad."" Mental health issues 'rise' during Wales lockdown BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' Children's mental health 'collateral damage' Their eight-year-old daughter Holli has raised thousands of pounds for charity by having her hair cut off on the date of her father's birthday. She said her favourite things to do with her father were ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did because I got to spend time with my dad"". ""It would always make him smile and we would always have so much fun,"" said Holli. She explained she wants to raise awareness so people ""don't have to suffer anymore"". Holli said she enjoyed ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did"" with her dad Mental health charity Mind Cymru has warned of the effects of the pandemic on people's mental health and on people's willingness to seek help. ""People haven't been seeking help for a number of reasons, fear of contracting the virus, but also maybe not feeling they deserve help at that time,"" said Simon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru. ""You may feel that how you're feeling emotionally isn't as important as the physical challenges that people are facing, but we know in the long run it's really important that people talk, and that people still seek help, because your mental health is as important as your physical health."" Figures published earlier in the year suggestedtwice as many adults had reported symptoms of depressioncompared with the same time last year. A survey of more than 3,500 adults found almost one in five appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with just under one in ten before the pandemic.

"Working from home 'could lead to more prejudice'Offices and workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, a study suggests.UK","Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests. Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"". He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations. The study, conducted by polling company Survation for theWoolf Institute,external, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people. Home working here to stay, say businesses Bad backs and wobbly tables: 'I hate working from home' Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities. ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced. The study also examined people's opinions on diversity. Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person. ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The report also indicates that a majority of Muslims were themselves uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish or Sikh person, or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person. ""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said. The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known asMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP),external, which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added. Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique calledMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).,external MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities.

"Flu vaccine shortage in NI is 'deeply concerning'Northern Ireland is almost 200,000 doses short, affecting those aged 65 and over.Northern Ireland","The Public Health Agency said uptake of the vaccine has been higher than ever before. There is ""no shortage"" of ordered flu vaccines for Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. NI's GP committee had said that Northern Ireland was almost 200,000 doses short of the flu vaccine. The chair of NI's GP committee had raised concerns that it would not be possible to complete the vaccination programme for those aged over 65. But the Public Health Agency (PHA) now says that this is not the case. Concerns about a shortage of flu vaccine initially emerged after a meeting of GPs and Public Health Agency representatives last week. Dr Alan Stout, chair of NI's GP committee (NIGPC), then wrote to GPs across Northern Ireland and said he was ""deeply concerned and frustrated"" about a shortfall in flu vaccines. The BBC has also learned that after last week's meeting,  Dr Stout wrote to the chief medical officer highlighting their concerns over the shortfall of about 200,000 vaccine doses. In an email to Dr Michael McBride and seen by BBC News NI Dr Alan Stout said: ""You will see that it is far from satisfactory and puts practices in a very difficult situation and really does put at risk the completion of the flu campaign this year. ""Is this all consistent with your own understanding? ""We have a large number of practices with significant numbers of patients still to be vaccinated. We need to get advice to them ASAP about when they can do this and what vaccine they should give. "" But on Monday Dr Gerry Waldron from the PHA said there was not a shortage and he hoped the confusion would not deter those coming forward. Later on Monday Robin Swann also denied there was a shortage and said Northern Ireland had ordered in total 1,050,300 doses for this year. As of last Friday, 826,890 doses had been delivered into Northern Ireland, with 601,243 doses delivered to GPs and health trusts. Flu vaccine clinics 'frantically cancelled' NI to 'pause' flu vaccinations for under-65s Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Mr Swann said two further deliveries had arrived in NI on Monday morning, with the total amount of vaccine delivered now standing at 1,019,590 doses. Thirty thousand doses of childhood vaccine still to be delivered are the ""only remaining order outstanding"", he told the assembly. From the outside looking in, things appear a bit of a mess. Here are two reputable bodies - the Public Health Agency and the NI GP committee - each with their own versions of an important meeting last week. On the one hand GPs have said they were left in no doubt of the shortfall; on Sunday the Public Health Agency confirmed in a statement that postponing clinics would ""inconvenience"" GPs. At no point did the PHA challenge or contradict what GPs had told the BBC. Twenty-four hours on, however, and it is an entirely different story with the PHA adamant that Northern Ireland now has enough vaccine to go around. The British Medical Association has reacted saying it is ""delighted"" with the news. All of this highlights the importance of clear messaging, especially during a pandemic. Communication between health officials and those on the ground needs to be accurate and up to date. All of that will go some way in reassuring the public that when it comes to vaccines, those charged with obtaining and delivering them are in complete control of everything that is going on. The PHA's Dr Gerry Waldron said for those aged over 65, about 296,000 vaccines are in Northern Ireland and this is ""the full amount that was planned"". ""It was always anticipated that stock would arrive in planned batches, and with the initial batch of vaccine for under-65s used up extremely quickly, the decision to pause was purely practical, as it was simply not possible to continue to vaccinate until the next planned tranche of vaccine became available,"" Dr Waldron said. There are two different flu vaccines available for different age groups Following the clarification from Mr Swann and the PHA, Dr Stout said: ""As of 8am when practices opened this morning they did not know that there was additional flu vaccine available in Northern Ireland. ""We've only found that out during the course of the day and the only communication that I have got on that is through the press and through the media. ""It is a good thing that we now know that it is here, but this is part of the confusion, this is part of the problem.""

Alcohol ban comes into force on ScotRail networkPeople are no longer allowed to drink alcohol on trains or at stations as part of measures to stem Covid.Scotland,"The rail operator said the measure would help to maintain the physical distancing required when travelling A ban on the consumption of alcohol on trains and at stations in Scotland has come into effect. ScotRail said the temporary policy had been put in place to support public health measures and keep people safe during the Covid pandemic. The rail operator said the new measures would help to maintain the physical distancing required while travelling. British Transport Police has been asked to assist railway staff to ensure the new guidelines are being followed. ScotRail said the restriction would be reviewed continuously as government guidelines changed and it was not intended to be permanent. It comes amid warnings that parts of the central belt face being placed under thehighest level of Covid restrictions to stem the rate of infection. Councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire andStirling health board areashave been told it is possible they may need to move from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. The consumption of alcohol had previously been banned on ScotRail services between 21:00 and 10:00. However, that has now been extended to all journeys. David Lister, ScotRail sustainability and safety assurance director, said the operator had been encouraged by compliance with safety measures so far, including the use of face coverings on trains, which he said stood at about 90%. He said that people would be ""politely"" encouraged to comply with the new alcohol measures and that on-train and station staff would have body cameras to record breaches. He added: ""If they don't comply we will be contacting the British Transport Police to deal with the matter."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Working from home 'could lead to more prejudice'Offices and workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, a study suggests.","Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests. Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"". He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations. The study, conducted by polling company Survation for theWoolf Institute,external, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people. Home working here to stay, say businesses Bad backs and wobbly tables: 'I hate working from home' Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities. ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced. The study also examined people's opinions on diversity. Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person. ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The report also indicates that a majority of Muslims were themselves uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish or Sikh person, or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person. ""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said. The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known asMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP),external, which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added. Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique calledMultilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).,external MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities.

Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemicCovid-19 has forced the probation service to change how it monitors high-risk offenders.Wales,"This video can not be played ""It can be shocking sometimes,"" says probation officer Salli Dixon Working from home during a pandemic has brought extra challenges for probation officers who work with serious offenders after their release from prison. Many have had to handle unpleasant subject matter in their own homes, as they deal remotely with violent or sexual offenders. I spent the day with a member of the probation team that works with the 50 most dangerous male offenders in Cardiff, to see how they are managing. Salli Dixon is part of the special team of probation officers usually based at a police station. While some face-to-face appointments have continued, whether in the office or the offender's doorstep, others have to be done over the phone or by video call. The pandemic also means more of the work is done remotely from home, including work with sex offenders. ""It makes it a little more hard to switch off mentally, and you're having really difficult conversations in your home environment, which feels intrusive,"" she says. ""But it hasn't made the service any less effective. We can't have a less effective service - we protect the public, so we've just had to adapt."" Her first call of the day is with a registered child sex offender, who is living in a halfway house after recently being released from prison. Salli speaking to a registered sex offender who ""gets anxious"" and thinks the ""way out"" might be going back to prison He's tested positive for Covid-19 and has been moved into isolation quarters, meaning their appointment must now be over the phone. He tells her he's anxious about plans to find him his own flat where he would be living alone full-time. The length of time prison leavers spend in approved premises like a halfway house has been reduced during the pandemic. ""It's a little early if I'm honest - far, far too early,"" he says. ""When my mind is in a corner and up against a wall - it just goes 'right where is the way out? The way out is to go back to prison'."" Many probation checks not carried out in lockdown Child sexual offences double in five years Covid rules keep inmates in cells 23 hours a day His anxieties are kicking in, meaning his risks increase, Salli explains. ""He has got 16 or 17 instances of breaching his restrictions, usually by going too close to an area where there are children - like a nursery or school. He says he does that because he wants to self-sabotage and go back into prison,"" she says. ""So when he feels that he is being moved into his own accommodation, where he'll be by himself, he gets anxious and he thinks it's easier to just do something that would warrant him going back inside. ""The risk to the public would be that he would commit a child contact sex offence. He hasn't done that yet, but we can't rule out that he wouldn't."" ""We're not completely desensitised, we still hear things that shock us"" How does she feel discussing the nature of his offending? ""We're not completely desensitised as probation officers, because we still hear things that shock us,"" she says. ""No matter how long you've done a job it is quite difficult sometimes and quite unusual to hear somebody talk candidly about their sexual views towards children."" The small team deals with complex cases - like repeat domestic violence or sex offenders who also have additional issues, such as a personality disorder, mental health problems or drug and alcohol misuse. Known as Wisdom (Wales Integrated Serious and Dangerous Offender Management), they have a reduced case load to reflect the risks posed, as well as more resources than typical probation officers. Her second case of the day is able to come to the office. He committed a sex offence against a vulnerable adult and was released earlier this year after decades in prison. One of the sex offenders Salli is working with has struggled with the pace of life outside prison, but has done ""phenomenally well"" Much has changed since he was a young man on the outside, and he says the pace of life compared with prison has felt overwhelming at times. Weeks after his release, lockdown was announced and he too wonders whether it would be better to be back in prison. ""We've done a lot of work around what's going well and the reasons he wants to stay out,"" says Salli. ""If you reinforce that enough, they will make changes and they will stay out. He's done phenomenally well."" My dad's a sex offender. Can people like him change? Covid curbs 'a blessing in disguise for prisons' Prisoners making hundreds of PPE items every week She still carries out some home visits, but they're now on the doorstep, which naturally makes the job more challenging. ""We're risk assessors, it's what we're trained to do. So even though we might not be able to physically go inside, we'll do everything we can to make sure that everyone is safe."" The use of video calls also means more checks can be done in a day, but if Salli is working from home she has to make sure none of her personal items are on view. ""I would try and have video calls in the office because not only is it safer but I'm in the right frame of mind to be talking to somebody [in that] environment."" Covid-19 has also brought greater practical challenges for the men she works with. ""It's made it more difficult for people to access basic things like housing, money and universal credit, signing up at the doctors, getting a prescription. We've had to be more hands on in terms of helping people get set up."" The rewards keep her going, she said, and she is proud of the good the team is doing for the wider community. ""We change people's lives,"" she says. ""I wouldn't do it if I didn't enjoy it. It's got its ups and downs and you know you can't help change everyone. You have to manage your expectations about what you can help people achieve.""

Reluctance over mental health help during pandemic,"This video can not be played Rainbow says Carl always had a smile for everyone, even when he was at his ""lowest ebb"" People struggling with their mental health during the pandemic ""do not feel entitled to seek help"" while others suffer with Covid-19, a charity said. A Mind Cymru survey of 900 people found a third of adults and a quarter of young people fail to get help because they did not think they deserved it. The charity said conditions had become ""more acute but also more complex"". A woman from Newport has urged people to ask for help after the father of her children took his own life in July. Rainbow, pictured with daughter Holli, says Carl ""struggled to talk"" Carl Morgan took his own life, aged 43, and Rainbow Chicharro said he ""struggled to talk"". She added: ""You would never have known Carl was suffering on the inside because even when he was at his lowest ebb, he would always have a smile for everybody. ""He would always put everybody else first before himself. His energy was infectious and whenever we had a gathering he was always the loudest and brightest of the bunch. It's really sad."" Mental health issues 'rise' during Wales lockdown BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' Children's mental health 'collateral damage' Their eight-year-old daughter Holli has raised thousands of pounds for charity by having her hair cut off on the date of her father's birthday. She said her favourite things to do with her father were ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did because I got to spend time with my dad"". ""It would always make him smile and we would always have so much fun,"" said Holli. She explained she wants to raise awareness so people ""don't have to suffer anymore"". Holli said she enjoyed ""game nights, pizza nights and all the bike rides we did"" with her dad Mental health charity Mind Cymru has warned of the effects of the pandemic on people's mental health and on people's willingness to seek help. ""People haven't been seeking help for a number of reasons, fear of contracting the virus, but also maybe not feeling they deserve help at that time,"" said Simon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru. ""You may feel that how you're feeling emotionally isn't as important as the physical challenges that people are facing, but we know in the long run it's really important that people talk, and that people still seek help, because your mental health is as important as your physical health."" Figures published earlier in the year suggestedtwice as many adults had reported symptoms of depressioncompared with the same time last year. A survey of more than 3,500 adults found almost one in five appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with just under one in ten before the pandemic.

"The baby stealersThe baby stealersTwo new Covid testing 'mega labs' in early 2021The labs will use technology to speed up the process so results come faster, the government says.","Babiesare being stolen to order in Kenya to feed a thriving black market.In a year-long investigation, BBCAfrica Eye infiltrated the trafficking ringssellingchildrenfor as little as Â£300. Rebecca's son was snatched in the night. ""I hope one day he will come back,"" she said Somewhere, Rebecca's son is 10. He could be in Nairobi, where she lives, or he could be somewhere else. He could, she knows in her heart, be dead. The last time she saw him, Lawrence Josiah, her firstborn son, he was one. She was 16. It was about 2am one night in March 2011 and Rebecca was drowsy from sniffing a handkerchief doused in jet fuel â a cheap high on the city's streets. She sniffed jet fuel because it gave her the confidence to go up to strangers and beg. By the time Rebecca was 15, her mother could no longer support her or pay her school fees and she dropped out and slid into life on the street. She met an older man who promised to marry her but instead made her pregnant and left. The following year Lawrence Josiah was born, and Rebecca raised him for a year and a few months until she closed her eyes that night and never saw him again. ""Even though I have other kids, he was my firstborn, he made me a mother,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I have searched in every children's centre, in Kiambu, Kayole, and I have never found him."" Rebecca still lives on the same streets in Nairobi. She is small, with sharp cheekbones and short, tightly braided hair. She has three more children now â girls aged eight, six, and four. The youngest girl was grabbed once, she said, by a man who'd been hanging around the area, and claimed the barely one-year-old girl had asked him to buy her a drink. Rebecca followed him to a car afterwards, she said, where a woman was waiting. The next day, he was back. Rebecca and her youngest girl. ""You have to be alert,"" she said. ""The rich people will steal your baby as you sleep"" You do not have to look hard to find similar stories around the streets where Rebecca lives, alongside other unhoused Nairobi residents. Esther's three-year-old son disappeared in August 2018. ""I have never been at peace since I lost my child,"" she said. ""I have searched for him all the way to Mombasa."" It's been five years since Carol's two-year-old son was snatched in the middle of the night. ""I loved him so much,"" she said. ""I would forgive them if they would just give me back my child."" Vulnerable women are being preyed on in Nairobi to feed a thriving black market for babies. Over the course of a year-long investigation, Africa Eye has found evidence of children being snatched from homeless mothers and sold for massive profits. We uncovered illegal child trafficking in street clinics and babies being stolen to order at a major government-run hospital. And in an effort to expose those abusing government positions, we arranged to purchase an abandoned child from a hospital official, who used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week old boy before selling him directly to us. The baby-stealers range from vulnerable opportunists to organised criminals â often both elements working together. Among the opportunists are women like Anita, a heavy drinker and drug user who herself lives on and off the street, and makes money stealing children from women like Rebecca â targeting mothers with infants under the age of three. Africa Eye found out about Anita through a friend of hers, who wanted to remain anonymous. The friend, who asked to be called Emma, said Anita had different methods for snatching children on the street. ""Sometimes she will speak to the mother first, to try and see if the mother knows what she plans to do,"" Emma said. ""Sometimes she will drug the mother, give her sleeping pills or glue. Sometimes she will play with the kid. ""Anita has a lot of ways to get kids."" Emma helped expose a woman she knew stealing babies from unsuspecting street mothers Posing as potential buyers, Africa Eye set up a meeting with Anita in a pub in downtown Nairobi frequented by street sellers. Anita told us she was under pressure from her boss to steal more children, and she described a recent abduction. ""The mother was new to the streets, she seemed to be confused, not aware of what was going on,"" she said. ""She trusted me with her child. Now I have the child."" Anita said her boss was a local businesswoman who bought stolen babies from petty criminals and sold them for a profit. Some of the customers were ""women who are barren, so for them this is a kind of adoption,"" she said, but ""some use them for sacrifices"". ""Yes, they are used for sacrifices. These children just disappear from the streets and they are never seen again."" That dark hint echoed something Emma had already told us, that Anita said some buyers ""take the kids for rituals"". In reality, once Anita has sold a child on, she knows little about its fate. She charges the businesswoman 50,000 shillings for a girl or 80,000 shillings for a boy, she said â Â£350 or Â£550. That is roughly the going rate in Nairobi to steal a child from a woman on the street. ""The businesswoman, she never says the business she does with the kids,"" Emma said. ""I asked Anita does she know what the woman does with them, and she told me she could not care less whether she takes them to witchcraft or whatever. As long as she has money, she does not ask."" Soon after the first meeting, Anita called to arrange another. When we arrived, she was sitting with a baby girl who she said was five months old and she had just snatched moments before, after winning the mother's trust. ""She gave it to me for a second and I ran away with it,"" she said. Anita said she had a buyer lined up to purchase the girl for 50,000 shillings. Emma, our source, attempted to intervene, saying she had been introduced to a buyer who could pay 80,000. ""That is good,"" Anita said. ""Let's seal the deal up for tomorrow."" This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings A meeting was set for 5pm. Because a child's life was in danger, Africa Eye informed the police, who set up a sting operation to arrest Anita and rescue the child, once our buyer had met her. It was likely to be the last opportunity to secure this baby girl before she disappeared. But Anita never showed up, and despite trying for days we were unable to find her. Weeks later, Emma finally tracked her down. She told us Anita said she had found a higher bidder and used the money to build a two-room, tin-sheet house in one of the city's slums. The child was gone. The police still have an open file on Anita. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in Kenya â no government reports, no comprehensive national surveys. The agencies responsible for finding missing children and tracking the black market are under-resourced and under-staffed. One of the few safeguards for mothers whose children are taken is Missing Child Kenya, an NGO founded and run by Maryana Munyendo. In its four years in operation, the organisation has worked on about 600 cases, Munyendo said. ""This is a very big issue in Kenya but it is under-reported. At Missing Child Kenya we have barely scratched the surface."" The issue had ""not been prioritised in action response plans for social welfare,"" she said. That is partly because this is a crime whose victims tend to be vulnerable, voiceless women like Rebecca, who do not have the resources or social capital to draw media attention or drive action from the authorities. ""The under-reporting has a strong correlation to the economic status of the victims,"" Munyendo said. ""They lack the resources, networks and information to be able go somewhere and say, 'Hey, can someone follow up on my missing child?'"" The driving force behind the black market is a persistent cultural stigma around infertility. ""Infertility is not a good thing for a woman in an African marriage,"" Munyendo said. ""You are expected to have a child and it should be a boy. If you can't, you might get kicked out of your home. So what do you do? You steal a child."" A boy in the Nairobi slum Kayole, where child trafficking is ""booming"", a local journalist said A woman in that situation will most likely be put in touch with a trafficker like Anita's boss, who uses vulnerable people like Anita to snatch children on the street. Or they might be connected to someone with access to a hospital. According to Africa Eye's research, child-trafficking rings are operating within the walls of some of Nairobi's biggest government-run hospitals. Through a source, we approached Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. It is Leparan's job to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable children born at Mama Lucy. But our source said Leparan was directly involved in trafficking. The source arranged to meet Leparan, and told him he knew of a woman desperate to purchase a child after failing to conceive. ""I have this baby boy in the hospital,"" Leparan replied. ""They dropped him off two weeks ago and never came back."" According to our source, this was not the first time Leparan had arranged to sell a child. ""The last case scared me,"" Leparan said in the meeting, which Africa Eye recorded. ""Suppose we do this, I want a plan that won't cause us problems later on,"" he said. Fred Leparan accepted 300,000 Kenyan shillings to steal a child from Mama Lucy hospital Children like the abandoned baby boy on offer from Leparan should be taken to a government children's home while they are placed officially with foster parents who have been subject to background and welfare checks. When they are sold illegally by people like Fred Leparan, nobody really knows where they will end up. Posing as a woman called Rose, an undercover reporter working for Africa Eye met Leparan at an office close to the hospital. Leparan asked a few cursory questions about Rose's status. She said she was married but could not conceive, and was under pressure from her husband's family to give birth. ""Have you tried adoption?"" Leparan asked. ""We thought about it but it seems like it is a bit complicated,"" Rose replied. With that, Leparan agreed. The price would be 300,000 shillings â Â£2,000. ""If we go ahead with this deal it will only be the three of us - me, you and him,"" he said, pointing to Rose and our source. ""My issue is trusting someone. It is very risky. It worries me a lot."" He said he would be in touch to arrange the sale. Between the street snatchers like Anita and the corrupt officials like Leparan, there is another layer to Nairobi's child-trafficking business. Dotted around some of the city's slums you can find illegal street clinics with delivery rooms for expectant mothers. These makeshift clinics are a known location for the black-market trade in babies. Working with a local journalist, Judith Kanaitha of Ghetto Radio, Africa Eye approached a clinic in Nairobi's Kayole neighbourhood, home to thousands of the city's poorest residents. According to Kanaitha, the baby trade is booming in Kayole. The clinic we approached is operated by a woman known as Mary Auma, who said she had worked as a nurse in some of Nairobi's biggest hospitals. Kanaitha posed as a buyer. Inside the clinic, two women were already in labour. ""This one, she is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she is almost ready to deliver,"" Auma said, whispering. She offered to sell the unborn child to Kanaitha for 45,000 shillings â Â£315. Auma did not appear concerned for the mother's welfare after the birth. ""As soon as she gets her money, she will go,"" she said, waving her hand. ""We make it clear, they never come back."" This video can not be played Mary Auma negotiates the sale at her street clinic The woman in the clinic that day whose unborn baby Auma was negotiating for sale was Adama. Adama was broke. Like Rebecca, she had been abandoned by the man who got her pregnant, and the pregnancy had cost her her job on a construction site when she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. So Adama decided to sell her baby. Mary Auma was not offering her the 45,000 shillings she was attempting to charge us. She told Adama the deal was for just 10,000 â Â£70. ""Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,"" Adama said later, in an interview in her village. ""But I was desperate and I didn't have a choice."" Adama said that the day we walked into the clinic, Mary Auma had just induced her, without warning, by giving her tablets to swallow. Auma had a buyer and was keen to make a sale. But the birth was not smooth. The baby boy had chest issues and Auma told Adama to take him to Mama Lucy hospital for treatment. After two weeks, Adama was discharged with the baby. She texted Auma, and Auma texted us. ""New package has been born,"" she wrote. ""45,000k."" Illegal street clinics dot the Nairobi slums like Kayole At the clinic, Adama was reunited with Auma and her assistant. ""They said the baby looked OK and if the client wanted him he would be taken straightaway,"" she said. Adama had made a painful choice to sell her child. Now she was reconsidering. ""I did not want to sell my baby to someone who would not be able to take care of him, or someone who buys babies to go use them for other things,"" she said later. So Adama left the clinic that day carrying her baby boy. She dropped him instead at the government-run children's hospital, where he would wait for foster parents and, she hoped, a better life. She never got the money she needed. She lives alone now, away from Nairobi, and sometimes she dreams about her son and wakes in the early hours and thinks about him. Sometimes, if she can't get back to sleep, she walks down the road in the dark until she finds someone else awake. But she doesn't regret her choice. ""I feel at peace to have given my baby to the government,"" she said, ""because I know he is safe."" Fred Leparan, the clinical social worker at the government hospital, called to say he had identified a baby boy given up by his mother that he wanted to steal for us. The boy was one of three children at the hospital waiting to be transferred to a nearby children's home. It was Leparan's job to ensure they got there safely. But Leparan knew that once the babies left Mama Lucy hospital, there was only a slim chance anyone from there would check they had arrived at the home. At the hospital, Leparan filled out the necessary paperwork and made small talk with the staff, who had no idea that a child was being stolen on their watch. Rose, the undercover reporter, was waiting in a car outside. Leparan told the hospital nurses she worked for the children's home and asked them to take the babies out to her. He seemed increasingly anxious, but he assured our source that the nurses would not follow them. ""No, they can't, they have work to do,"" he said. Then he urged the team to leave quickly. ""If we keep chatting like this someone may suspect,"" he said. This video can not be played Fred Leparan orchestrates the transfer of the child at Mama Lucy Moments later, the team drove out of Mama Lucy hospital with three infant children in the car and instructions to deliver just two of them to the children's home. From there, the third baby could have gone anywhere, to anyone. The undercover team delivered all three children safely to the home, where they will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. Later that afternoon, Leparan called Rose to a meeting and instructed her to place the agreed 300,000 shillings on the table. He instructed her to see a nutritionist. ""The only thing to keep an eye on is the boy's vaccine mark,"" he said. ""Also, be careful. Be very careful."" The BBC confronted Fred Leparan about this transaction but he refused to comment. The hospital also declined requests to comment, and Leparan appears to have kept his job. We also informed a children's rights NGO about Mary Auma's illegal street clinic in Kayole, which in turn informed the police. But Auma appears to still be in business. She did not respond when we put our allegations to her. And we attempted to put our allegations to Anita, but she seemed to have once again disappeared into the shadows of the street. ""We all want to be mothers to our children,"" Rebecca said. ""It is not our fault we are in the streets."" For the mothers whose children were stolen, there will never be any real resolution. Most go on in limbo, hoping to see their child again, knowing that they probably won't. Rebecca would give ""everything"" to see her son, she said. ""And if he died I would like to know too."" Last year, she heard that someone saw a boy in a distant neighbourhood of Nairobi that looked just like her eldest daughter, Lawrence Josiah's sister. Rebecca knew it was probably nothing, and she had no way of getting to the neighbourhood and no idea where to look if she did. She did get as far as the local police station, but she couldn't get any help, she said, and eventually she gave up. ""There is a one in a million chance these women will see their children again,"" said Maryana Munyendo, from Missing Child Kenya. ""Many of the street mothers are children themselves, and they are taken advantage of in their vulnerability."" People like Rebecca were too often not seen as sympathetic victims of crime, Munyendo said. ""But nobody should assume that people on the street do not have feelings, that they do not deserve justice. They do have feelings. The way you miss your child if you live in a suburban area is the same way you miss your child if you are a mother on the street."" Some of the babies stolen from the street will end up in those suburban areas. Sometimes Rebecca thinks about the wealthier women who paid for them â about what it takes to raise a child you know was stolen from someone else. ""What are they thinking?"" she said. ""How do they feel?"" Additional reporting by Kassim Mohamed and Elijah Kanyi. Photographs by Brian Inganga. All images copyright Imported for my body: Trafficked to India for sex.

"Two new Covid testing 'mega labs' in early 2021The labs will use technology to speed up the process so results come faster, the government says.","Two new ""mega labs"" will open in early 2021 with the aim of doubling the UK's daily coronavirus testing capacity, the government has said. The sites - at Leamington Spa in the Midlands and another at an unconfirmed site in Scotland - will increase testing capacity by 600,000. The latest data shows,externalcurrent capacity is around 519,000 - although the number of tests actually processed is lower. Meanwhile, Labour is calling for a national plan to roll out the vaccine. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccination programme will probably be the largest logistical operation since World War Two - and called for a plan setting out who will be eligible for a jab and when. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Coronavirus testing explained Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but the government's system has experienced setbacks during the pandemic. In recent weeks, the governmenthas started to pilot mass testing- including people with no symptoms - using a new type of rapid swab tests which do not need to be sent to a lab. However, the bulk of the UK's testing still uses the standard swab test that need to be analysed in a lab. Announcing the two new ""mega labs"", the government said they will use technology to speed up the process - for example through automation and robotics. ""This means more tests will be processed more quickly and at a lower cost, and therefore faster turnaround times for test results,"" the Department of Health said. The sites will create up to 4,000 jobs, with the labs also being used to process tests for other illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. They would each add 300,000 to the UK's daily testing capacity - defined as how many tests can be processed in the lab each day - when operating at maximum. The testing capacity is different to how many tests are actually processed. For example, the latest figures for Friday showed that although the UK's capacity was 519,951, the number of tests carried out was 379,955. Officialshave previously saidit is natural that not all the capacity is used up, and there needs to be flexibility in the system to cope with surges in demand or problems with equipment or staff. On the face of it the planned new ""mega labs"" will mark a significant boost to UK testing capacity. The current capability of 500,000 tests a day will be more than doubled when the two labs are up and running. But the big unanswered question is when? The timing is vague with only an aim for an opening early next year. The site for the Scottish lab has not yet been announced. Previous pledges on testing capacity have not always been met. A new ""lighthouse lab"" at Charnwood in the East Midlands was due to open in early October. That didn't happen although government sources say it will come online ""in the coming months"" along with three others. Plans are one thing. Delivery is another. More details of the ""mega labs"" will be closely scrutinised when they are published. ""We didn't go into this crisis with a significant diagnostics industry, but we have built one, and these two mega labs are another step forward,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""These mega labs are future-proofing our national infrastructure to respond to future epidemics and improving care for other diseases."" The Scotland lab - which will be rolled out after Leamington Spa - will create about 1,800 jobs, the Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said. Its location is yet to be confirmed. She described the establishment of the mega lab as ""an important step in our fight against the virus"" that will ""significantly"" increase testing and diagnostic capacity. Ms Freeman added: ""The facility, which will follow on from the lab in Leamington Spa, will also have the flexibility to provide diagnostic capability in the future for other diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and will support Scotland's growing precision medicine industry."" Separately,the NHS announced,externalit is launching 40 clinics specialising in ""long Covid"" which will start opening at the end of November. The condition is thought to affect more than 60,000 people in the UK. Meanwhile, hope continues that a Covid vaccine will be rolled out in coming months. At the weekend, the co-founder of pharmaceutical company BioNTech, whose vaccine with Pfizer has shown positive early results, said life should be back to normal by next winter. Prof Ugur Sahin saidif everything continued to go well, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"". This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" Labour's Sir Keir has called on Boris Johnson to publish a national action plan for rolling out a vaccine ""that harnesses all of the talents of the British people: our businesses, nurses, doctors, scientists and public servants"". He said the government should consider supporting councils to refurbish town halls or sport centres into local vaccine clinics, and also launch a nationwide public health campaign to crack down on vaccine fake news. ""We are world leaders in vaccines, and I believe we should be aiming for a world class programme for rolling it out,"" he said. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Last week, BioNTech and Pfizer became the first vaccine developers to share preliminary analysis that showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. Their vaccine is one of 11 in the final stages of testing. However, there is no data yet to show how well the jab works in the elderly, and it is also not known if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick. The UK has ordered enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Theagency's head has saidit would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the UK's number of people who have died to 51,934.

"Covid insurance test case heads to Supreme CourtJudges' decisions on insurance payouts for business interruption has a bearing on 370,000 businesses.BusinessWorking from home 'could lead to more prejudice'Offices and workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, a study suggests.","A hotly-contested case about insurance payouts for small businesses who were unable to trade owing to lockdown heads to the Supreme Court on Monday. A host of businesses closed or faced significant losses, so made claims on their business interruption insurance. But many insurers disputed the claims, arguing policies were never meant to cover such unprecedented restrictions. Supreme Court judges will make a final judgement after the hearing, which is expected to last four days. The issue will have had implications for 370,000 - mostly small - businesses, and involves potential payouts of Â£1.2bn. High Court judges earlier found mostly in favour of insurers having to pay out to policyholders regarding a selection of policy types. Some of these decisions are now being appealed against at the Supreme Court. Many thousands of businesses could not operate during the first national lockdown because, for example, they were unable to enter their premises. Anna Smart and her husband Robin had to relocate to their back garden It meant some went out of business. Others - like Anna and Robin Smart's photography studio in Oxfordshire - had to downsize, make staff redundant, or relocate. The Smarts moved their studio into their back garden and said the whole situation caused ""immense stress"". They, like others, looked to their insurer for compensation via their business interruption insurance policies. Some businesses paid premiums of many thousands of pounds a year for such cover. Some insurers refused to pay out, in some cases because they said disease clauses in contracts did not cover such a scenario. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, brought a test case with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. This went to the High Court, where judges found that most, but not all, of the policies involved should pay out offering a potential lifeline to many of these small businesses. But many have still had to wait while the proceedings were fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court. The High Court looked at 21 policy types as part of a test case, and rulings on 13 have been appealed against. These will be discussed in complex legal arguments over four days at the Supreme Court. 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling Of these, the lower court said 11 should have led to payouts - decisions now being appealed against by insurers. Judges said two should not pay out, and these are the subject of appeal by the FCA. For two insurers, Zurich and Ecclesiastical, the judgement found entirely in their favour and the FCA decided not to appeal against the findings. The final ruling by the Supreme Court judges will provide authoritative guidance for the other policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. For example, the Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. The Supreme Court will give judgement some weeks after next week's hearing. The FCA will expect insurers to respond quickly to the final judgement, if the result means they are required to do so. Many businesses will have renewed annual policies since the first lockdown began and these will have Covid exclusions, so claims are mostly relevant for older policies during the first UK lockdown.

States clamp down as US cases pass 11 million mark,"Hospital admissions and new cases are at record levels in the United States Michigan, Washington and California are the latest US states to bring in strict measures to try to curb the spread of Covid-19,as cases top 11 million,external. High schools and colleges are to halt on-site teaching while restaurants are prohibited from offering indoor dining in Michigan from Wednesday. Indoor restaurant dining is also banned in Washington State, and gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums will close. And much of California will return to its most severe restriction level. On average, more than 1,000 people a day are dying with the virus, and the overall death toll is close to 250,000. Hospital admissions have also reached record levels with nearly 150,000 new cases across the US on Monday. The Trump administration struck an optimistic note on Friday, saying it hoped to distribute 20 million doses of an approved vaccine in December, and for each month after that - although vaccines have yet to get official approval. These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases Is this Covid wave in US the worst yet? President-elect Joe Bidensaid on Monday that ""people may die""because of the White House's refusal to facilitate a presidential transition and co-ordinate with the Biden team for a vaccination campaign. The lack of cooperation is ""totally irresponsible"", he said. On Monday, in a major new development,US drug company Moderna said its Covid-19 vaccine was nearly 95% effective according to early results. A similar announcement earlier this month about another vaccine - from the companies Pfizer and BioNTech - sent stock markets soaring amid hopes that life could return to normal next year. Mr Biden celebrated the developments, but cautioned that distributing a vaccine to Americans is ""a huge, huge, undertaking"". Even without coordination between the president and the president-elect, aides to Mr Biden have said his team would nonetheless start talking to vaccine manufacturers. President Donald Trump on Monday celebrated the news and appeared to claim credit for the vaccine progress, writing on Twitter that these ""great developments...all took place on my watch"". Mr Trump has ruled out putting the nation into lockdown, but many states are introducing their own restrictions as fast rising cases threaten to overwhelm their healthcare systems. Michigan, Washington State and California have seen Covid cases double in recent weeks. Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the state was ""at the precipice"" and could soon suffer 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths a week unless action is taken. As well as suspending in-person teaching and indoor dining,Ms Whitmer also ordered the closure of public entertainment venues for a period of three weeks,external.

""Today, Sunday, November 15, 2020, is the most dangerous public health day in the last 100 years of our state's history,"" Governor Jay Inslee said. ""A pandemic is raging in our state. Left unchecked, it will assuredly result in grossly overburdened hospitals and morgues; and keep people from obtaining routine but necessary medical treatment for non-Covid conditions."" On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was pulling the ""emergency brake"", bringing more than 94% of the population under the strictest coronavirus guidance. In these counties, indoor restaurant spaces, worship spaces and gyms will be closed. Mr Newsom said he is also considering a state curfew to help slow the spread. He also apologised on Monday for his ""bad mistake"" in attending a lobbyist's birthday party that violated his own coronavirus-prevention rules. It emerged on Friday that he and his wife attended the celebration on 6 November at a Michelin-starred restaurant in wine country near San Francisco. ""The spirit of what I'm preaching all the time was contradicted,"" Mr Newsom said. ""I need to preach and practise, not just preach.""

Johnson self-isolating after MP tests positive,"Boris Johnson is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. The prime minister said he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace on Sunday but is not showing symptoms. Mr Johnson on Thursday spent about 35 minutes with Ashfield MP Lee Anderson who has since tested positive. The news came as No 10 said Mr Johnson would make ""critical announcements"" about coronavirus and ""levelling up"" the UK over the coming weeks. In an announcement planned before Mr Johnson was told to self-isolate, Downing Street said there would be a ""clear signal"" of his ""ongoing ambitions for the United Kingdom"". It said Mr Johnson would chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday But No 10's effort to start the week afresh following the departure of two of Mr Johnson's top aides amid an internal power struggle was overshadowed by news the prime minister was self-isolating. Mr Johnsonwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night: ""Today I was notified by NHS Test and Trace that I must self-isolate as I have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. ""I have no symptoms, but am following the rules and will be working from No 10 as I continue to lead the government's pandemic response."" A No 10 spokesman added: ""The PM is well and does not have any symptoms of Covid-19."" In a WhatsApp message to Tory MPs seen by the BBC the PM added: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace continues to improve. The bad news is that I have been pinged!"" He said that he would observe self-isolation rules despite ""following the guidance and socially distancing"" during his meeting with Mr Anderson. ""It doesn't matter that I feel fine - better than ever - or that my body is bursting with antibodies because I have already had the damn thing,"" he added. ""The rules are the rules and they are there to stop the spread of the disease."" In April, Mr Johnson spent three nights in intensive care after falling ill with the virus. He later saidit ""could have gone either way""and thanked healthcare workers for saving his life. Boris Johnson will now have to stay at home in No 10. It means he will not be able to be in Parliament, though I'm told he will be working from Downing Street. He does still intend to keep communicating with the country. It was supposed to be a pretty big week for Boris Johnson - he is trying to reset his government after some factional fighting in his office over the last few days. There are conversations taking place with the parliamentary authorities to see whether he can still contribute to the Commons. I think it is fair to say this has not come at the best time for Mr Johnson: he has big decisions to make on Brexit and what happens when England's lockdown ends on 2 December. And it is also worth bearing in mind he was extremely ill with coronavirus earlier in the year and we do not know what getting the virus does for a person's immunity. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Sunday evening he was urgently exploring how to ""support additional virtual participation"" in the chamber following a campaign by vulnerable MPs. Such a move could allow more MPs, including Mr Johnson, to attend Commons' debates virtually and possibly even Prime Minister's Questions as he self-isolates. On Thursday, Conservative MP Mr Anderson posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" Mr Johnson said he observed all the guidelines and distancing advice during his meeting with Lee Anderson on Thursday Mr Anderson posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable. ""On Friday I lost my sense of taste at the same time my wife had a bad headache,"" he said. ""I had no cough, no fever and felt well. We both had a test on Saturday and the result came in Sunday morning. ""My wife and I both tested positive. I feel absolutely fine and my biggest concern is my wife who is in the shielded group. ""But we are both feeling good."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthe news had come the night before what was meant to be a ""big relaunch week"", following the row last week involving the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummingsleft Downing Street for the last time on Fridayfollowing internal battles about his role. Earlier this weekend,senior Tory MP David Davis said Mr Cummings' departurewas a chance to ""reset government"". Another Conservative MP, Sir Charles Walker, said the changes were a sign of Mr Johnson's ""determination to rebuild relationships"". A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs had been scheduled for Monday. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area CASES NEAR YOU:How many cases in your area?

Officials also confirmed the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" would be published ""to boost green jobs whilst invigorating plans to achieve net zero by 2050"". Elements already announced include a newÂ£40m investment in green spaces across EnglandandÂ£160m for the wind turbine industry. In addition,another week of negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EUare set to begin in Brussels. The transition period, which followed Brexit in January, ends on 31 December by which time a deal needs to be agreed and approved by parliaments in the UK and EU. Chief UK negotiator David Frost has said there had been some progress between the two sides but that considerable differences remained.

Johnson self-isolating as 'critical' reset begins,"Downing Street says the prime minister and MP Lee Anderson were standing ""side by side"" and observed guidelines and distancing advice during their meeting with on Thursday Boris Johnson, six Tory MPs and two political aides are self-isolating after a breakfast meeting inside Downing Street last Thursday. One of the MPs, Lee Anderson, later tested positive for Covid-19, and on Sunday the prime minister was told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Ina video from No 10,external, Mr Johnson urged others to ""follow the rules"" if contacted by the system. The PM's official spokesman insisted that Downing Street is ""Covid-secure"". He said ""social distancing did happen"" but factors such as the length of the meeting were considered by Test and Trace. Mr Johnson, who wasadmitted to intensive carewith coronavirus seven months ago, spent about 35 minutes with Mr Anderson - who lost his sense of taste the day after the meeting. The five other MPs self-isolating following the meeting with ""Red Wall""  Tories include: Heywood & Middleton MPChris Clarkson South Ribble MPKatherine Fletcher Warrington South MPAndy Carter Great Grimsby MPLia Nici Bassetlaw MPBrendan Clarke-Smith Mr Johnson's spokesman declined to name the aides but suggested they were not Lee Cain or Dominic Cummings,who left Downing Street last week. Jacob Young, MP for Redcar, is also self-isolating - but said he was not at the meeting - while Basingstoke MP Maria Miller has said she is self-isolating after having been contacted by Test and Trace. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was right to self-isolate as ""it is important for all of us to say that we have got to comply with the advice and guidance"".

The PM's period of isolation began as the government prepares a policy relaunch. Downing Street said a series of ""critical announcements"" would this week detail Mr Johnson's ""ambitions for the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson will chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". The prime minister had been expected to lead a No 10 news conference on Monday but Health Secretary Matt Hancock took his place. However, Mr Johnson is hoping to take part in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons virtually, Downing Street said. How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said the prime minister's self-isolation would make no difference to the amount of work he would be able to do ""driving forward the agenda"". Asked if the PM and Mr Anderson followed social distancing rules during their meeting, he said there were rules ""around Downing Street being a Covid-secure workplace"". He added: ""The central point is that it doesn't matter who you are, if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate that is what you must do."" Photos of Mr Johnson and several Tory MPs show them standing close together. The prime minister had to self-isolate after one of them, Mr Anderson, developed Covid symptoms. Guidelines for offices require social distancing of 2m (6ft), or 1m plus precautions such as frequent cleaning and one-way systems where that is not possible. No 10 is yet to respond to a request from BBC Reality Check for details of the Covid-secure guidelines in Downing Street. But the PM's spokesman said ""social distancing did happen"" and that the picture shows Mr Johnson and Mr Anderson ""stood side-by-side, rather than face-to-face"". However, Test and Trace guidance defines a close contact as someone you spent more than 15 minutes with at a distance of under 2m. Mr Johnson's meeting with Mr Anderson lasted about 35 minutes and he would therefore be required to self-isolate if they were not more than 2m apart. In his video posted on Twitter, the PM said: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace is working ever-more efficiently, but the bad news is that they've pinged me and I've got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid. ""It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great. ""And actually, it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies. We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace."" According to No 10, the prime minister has had at least one antibody test for coronavirus. It remains unclear what effect, if any, previously having the coronavirus has on a person's immunity but experts think reinfection is likely to be rare,BBC health correspondent James Gallagher has reported. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said there have been more than 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reinfection globally. He added: ""I think most of us think the rate of reinfection is quite a lot higher than that, but not enormous."" Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14 day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? On Thursday, Mr Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield, posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" On Sunday, he posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable, after they both tested positive. The PMwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night that he had been notified by NHS Test and Trace that he must self-isolate as he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, and he would be working from No 10. The new policy plans follow thedramatic departure of the PM's chief adviserDominic Cummings last week. Over the weekend,senior Tory MPs said his exitwas a chance to ""reset government"" and a series of announcements are planned for this week, including the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs is scheduled to take place via online video conference later on Monday.

"'Ultimate entertainer' Des O'Connor dies aged 88The star, whose 45-year career included hit singles and TV chat shows, died ""peacefully"" in his sleep.Entertainment & Arts","Entertainer Des O'Connor has died at the age of 88, his agent has confirmed. The comedian, singer and TV host died on Saturday following a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire just over a week ago. He was known for hosting his own chat show, as well as Take Your Pick and Countdown - and for his friendship with Morecambe and Wise. In a statement his agent said he was ""well loved by absolutely everybody"" and ""loved life"". His long-time agent and family friend Pat Lake-Smith described him as the ""ultimate entertainer"" and said he had been recovering from the fall before his condition had suddenly deteriorated. She said: ""He was a joy to work with - he was talented, fun, positive, enthusiastic, kind and a total professional. He loved life, and considered enthusiasm almost as important as oxygen."" Obituary: Des O'Connor London-born O'Connor presented his own prime-time TV shows for more than 45 years but also had success as a singer. His friendship with comedy duo Morecambe and Wise saw him mocked for his singing ability in sketches despite a successful career which included four Top 10 hits and more than 30 albums. This video can not be played David Sillito looks back at Des O'Connor's career O'Connor appeared on stages around the world including hundreds of shows at the London Palladium. His fame soared when he was hired to host The Des O'Connor Show, which ran on ITV from 1963 to 1971. In 1977 he began hosting Des O'Connor Tonight, which started on BBC Two before moving to ITV, where it stayed until it ended in 2002. He later hosted the Channel 4 quiz show Countdown alongside Carol Vorderman, with the pair bowing out together in 2008, and was made a CBE for his services to entertainment and broadcasting in that year's birthday honours. This video can not be played Gyles Brandreth: ""I don't think you'll find anybody...who's got a thing to say against Des O'Connor"" O'Connor was married four times, and has described the end of his first three relationships as casualties of his obsession with work. In 2007, he married long-term girlfriend Jodie Brooke Wilson, who was 37 years his junior and gave birth to their son Adam when O'Connor was 72. O'Connor also had four daughters, Karin, TJ, Samantha and Kristina from his previous marriages. Tributes have been paid following his death, with Countdown co-host Vorderman saying he was a born entertainer and it had been a ""complete joy to work with him"". She told BBC News: ""I grew up throughout the Des O'Connor years, when he was on the television all the time, on Des O'Connor Tonight and the Morecambe and Wise shows. O'Connor was made a CBE in the 2008 Birthday Honours ""Up to 20 million people would sit around the television and watch and laugh, and I mean laugh until they cried. ""He was the king; he was one of the very great British television entertainers."" Fellow Countdown star Susie Dentdescribed him as a ""true gent"",externalwhile Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann said O'Connor ""never took himself too seriously"". Melanie Sykes, who hosted TV show Today With Des And Mel alongside O'Connor, said it was an ""education and a privilege to work with him"". She wrote on Instagram: ""He had talent in every fibre of his being and was stubborn as a mule. He was the full ticket as a friend and colleague."" Broadcaster Tony Blackburn said ""he was a great entertainer and more importantly a very nice person"", and TV presenter Gyles Brandreth described him as ""the ultimate professional"". Speaking about his sketches with Morecambe and Wise, comedian David Baddiel said: ""RIP Des O' Connor. It's worth remembering how brilliant he is at his own expense in these sketches."" Northampton Town Football Club alsojoined the tributes,externalto their former reserve player. The club said: ""We are very sorry to learn of the passing of Des O'Connor. Des famously played for our reserve team on a few occasions just after World War Two. Our thoughts are with all who knew Des."" Violinist Sue Croot told the BBC she had always treasured a signed photograph O'Connor gave to her father Ronald Croot, who was helping out on a production of Cinderella at the Grand Theatre in Swansea in the late 1950s.

Buying a baby on the black market,"Babiesare being stolen to order in Kenya to feed a thriving black market.In a year-long investigation, BBCAfrica Eye infiltrated the trafficking ringssellingchildrenfor as little as Â£300. Rebecca's son was snatched in the night. ""I hope one day he will come back,"" she said Somewhere, Rebecca's son is 10. He could be in Nairobi, where she lives, or he could be somewhere else. He could, she knows in her heart, be dead. The last time she saw him, Lawrence Josiah, her firstborn son, he was one. She was 16. It was about 2am one night in March 2011 and Rebecca was drowsy from sniffing a handkerchief doused in jet fuel â a cheap high on the city's streets. She sniffed jet fuel because it gave her the confidence to go up to strangers and beg. By the time Rebecca was 15, her mother could no longer support her or pay her school fees and she dropped out and slid into life on the street. She met an older man who promised to marry her but instead made her pregnant and left. The following year Lawrence Josiah was born, and Rebecca raised him for a year and a few months until she closed her eyes that night and never saw him again. ""Even though I have other kids, he was my firstborn, he made me a mother,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I have searched in every children's centre, in Kiambu, Kayole, and I have never found him."" Rebecca still lives on the same streets in Nairobi. She is small, with sharp cheekbones and short, tightly braided hair. She has three more children now â girls aged eight, six, and four. The youngest girl was grabbed once, she said, by a man who'd been hanging around the area, and claimed the barely one-year-old girl had asked him to buy her a drink. Rebecca followed him to a car afterwards, she said, where a woman was waiting. The next day, he was back. Rebecca and her youngest girl. ""You have to be alert,"" she said. ""The rich people will steal your baby as you sleep"" You do not have to look hard to find similar stories around the streets where Rebecca lives, alongside other unhoused Nairobi residents. Esther's three-year-old son disappeared in August 2018. ""I have never been at peace since I lost my child,"" she said. ""I have searched for him all the way to Mombasa."" It's been five years since Carol's two-year-old son was snatched in the middle of the night. ""I loved him so much,"" she said. ""I would forgive them if they would just give me back my child."" Vulnerable women are being preyed on in Nairobi to feed a thriving black market for babies. Over the course of a year-long investigation, Africa Eye has found evidence of children being snatched from homeless mothers and sold for massive profits. We uncovered illegal child trafficking in street clinics and babies being stolen to order at a major government-run hospital. And in an effort to expose those abusing government positions, we arranged to purchase an abandoned child from a hospital official, who used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week old boy before selling him directly to us. The baby-stealers range from vulnerable opportunists to organised criminals â often both elements working together. Among the opportunists are women like Anita, a heavy drinker and drug user who herself lives on and off the street, and makes money stealing children from women like Rebecca â targeting mothers with infants under the age of three. Africa Eye found out about Anita through a friend of hers, who wanted to remain anonymous. The friend, who asked to be called Emma, said Anita had different methods for snatching children on the street. ""Sometimes she will speak to the mother first, to try and see if the mother knows what she plans to do,"" Emma said. ""Sometimes she will drug the mother, give her sleeping pills or glue. Sometimes she will play with the kid. ""Anita has a lot of ways to get kids."" Emma helped expose a woman she knew stealing babies from unsuspecting street mothers Posing as potential buyers, Africa Eye set up a meeting with Anita in a pub in downtown Nairobi frequented by street sellers. Anita told us she was under pressure from her boss to steal more children, and she described a recent abduction. ""The mother was new to the streets, she seemed to be confused, not aware of what was going on,"" she said. ""She trusted me with her child. Now I have the child."" Anita said her boss was a local businesswoman who bought stolen babies from petty criminals and sold them for a profit. Some of the customers were ""women who are barren, so for them this is a kind of adoption,"" she said, but ""some use them for sacrifices"". ""Yes, they are used for sacrifices. These children just disappear from the streets and they are never seen again."" That dark hint echoed something Emma had already told us, that Anita said some buyers ""take the kids for rituals"". In reality, once Anita has sold a child on, she knows little about its fate. She charges the businesswoman 50,000 shillings for a girl or 80,000 shillings for a boy, she said â Â£350 or Â£550. That is roughly the going rate in Nairobi to steal a child from a woman on the street. ""The businesswoman, she never says the business she does with the kids,"" Emma said. ""I asked Anita does she know what the woman does with them, and she told me she could not care less whether she takes them to witchcraft or whatever. As long as she has money, she does not ask."" Soon after the first meeting, Anita called to arrange another. When we arrived, she was sitting with a baby girl who she said was five months old and she had just snatched moments before, after winning the mother's trust. ""She gave it to me for a second and I ran away with it,"" she said. Anita said she had a buyer lined up to purchase the girl for 50,000 shillings. Emma, our source, attempted to intervene, saying she had been introduced to a buyer who could pay 80,000. ""That is good,"" Anita said. ""Let's seal the deal up for tomorrow."" This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings A meeting was set for 5pm. Because a child's life was in danger, Africa Eye informed the police, who set up a sting operation to arrest Anita and rescue the child, once our buyer had met her. It was likely to be the last opportunity to secure this baby girl before she disappeared. But Anita never showed up, and despite trying for days we were unable to find her. Weeks later, Emma finally tracked her down. She told us Anita said she had found a higher bidder and used the money to build a two-room, tin-sheet house in one of the city's slums. The child was gone. The police still have an open file on Anita. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in Kenya â no government reports, no comprehensive national surveys. The agencies responsible for finding missing children and tracking the black market are under-resourced and under-staffed. One of the few safeguards for mothers whose children are taken is Missing Child Kenya, an NGO founded and run by Maryana Munyendo. In its four years in operation, the organisation has worked on about 600 cases, Munyendo said. ""This is a very big issue in Kenya but it is under-reported. At Missing Child Kenya we have barely scratched the surface."" The issue had ""not been prioritised in action response plans for social welfare,"" she said. That is partly because this is a crime whose victims tend to be vulnerable, voiceless women like Rebecca, who do not have the resources or social capital to draw media attention or drive action from the authorities. ""The under-reporting has a strong correlation to the economic status of the victims,"" Munyendo said. ""They lack the resources, networks and information to be able go somewhere and say, 'Hey, can someone follow up on my missing child?'"" The driving force behind the black market is a persistent cultural stigma around infertility. ""Infertility is not a good thing for a woman in an African marriage,"" Munyendo said. ""You are expected to have a child and it should be a boy. If you can't, you might get kicked out of your home. So what do you do? You steal a child."" A boy in the Nairobi slum Kayole, where child trafficking is ""booming"", a local journalist said A woman in that situation will most likely be put in touch with a trafficker like Anita's boss, who uses vulnerable people like Anita to snatch children on the street. Or they might be connected to someone with access to a hospital. According to Africa Eye's research, child-trafficking rings are operating within the walls of some of Nairobi's biggest government-run hospitals. Through a source, we approached Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. It is Leparan's job to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable children born at Mama Lucy. But our source said Leparan was directly involved in trafficking. The source arranged to meet Leparan, and told him he knew of a woman desperate to purchase a child after failing to conceive. ""I have this baby boy in the hospital,"" Leparan replied. ""They dropped him off two weeks ago and never came back."" According to our source, this was not the first time Leparan had arranged to sell a child. ""The last case scared me,"" Leparan said in the meeting, which Africa Eye recorded. ""Suppose we do this, I want a plan that won't cause us problems later on,"" he said. Fred Leparan accepted 300,000 Kenyan shillings to steal a child from Mama Lucy hospital Children like the abandoned baby boy on offer from Leparan should be taken to a government children's home while they are placed officially with foster parents who have been subject to background and welfare checks. When they are sold illegally by people like Fred Leparan, nobody really knows where they will end up. Posing as a woman called Rose, an undercover reporter working for Africa Eye met Leparan at an office close to the hospital. Leparan asked a few cursory questions about Rose's status. She said she was married but could not conceive, and was under pressure from her husband's family to give birth. ""Have you tried adoption?"" Leparan asked. ""We thought about it but it seems like it is a bit complicated,"" Rose replied. With that, Leparan agreed. The price would be 300,000 shillings â Â£2,000. ""If we go ahead with this deal it will only be the three of us - me, you and him,"" he said, pointing to Rose and our source. ""My issue is trusting someone. It is very risky. It worries me a lot."" He said he would be in touch to arrange the sale. Between the street snatchers like Anita and the corrupt officials like Leparan, there is another layer to Nairobi's child-trafficking business. Dotted around some of the city's slums you can find illegal street clinics with delivery rooms for expectant mothers. These makeshift clinics are a known location for the black-market trade in babies. Working with a local journalist, Judith Kanaitha of Ghetto Radio, Africa Eye approached a clinic in Nairobi's Kayole neighbourhood, home to thousands of the city's poorest residents. According to Kanaitha, the baby trade is booming in Kayole. The clinic we approached is operated by a woman known as Mary Auma, who said she had worked as a nurse in some of Nairobi's biggest hospitals. Kanaitha posed as a buyer. Inside the clinic, two women were already in labour. ""This one, she is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she is almost ready to deliver,"" Auma said, whispering. She offered to sell the unborn child to Kanaitha for 45,000 shillings â Â£315. Auma did not appear concerned for the mother's welfare after the birth. ""As soon as she gets her money, she will go,"" she said, waving her hand. ""We make it clear, they never come back."" This video can not be played Mary Auma negotiates the sale at her street clinic The woman in the clinic that day whose unborn baby Auma was negotiating for sale was Adama. Adama was broke. Like Rebecca, she had been abandoned by the man who got her pregnant, and the pregnancy had cost her her job on a construction site when she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. So Adama decided to sell her baby. Mary Auma was not offering her the 45,000 shillings she was attempting to charge us. She told Adama the deal was for just 10,000 â Â£70. ""Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,"" Adama said later, in an interview in her village. ""But I was desperate and I didn't have a choice."" Adama said that the day we walked into the clinic, Mary Auma had just induced her, without warning, by giving her tablets to swallow. Auma had a buyer and was keen to make a sale. But the birth was not smooth. The baby boy had chest issues and Auma told Adama to take him to Mama Lucy hospital for treatment. After two weeks, Adama was discharged with the baby. She texted Auma, and Auma texted us. ""New package has been born,"" she wrote. ""45,000k."" Illegal street clinics dot the Nairobi slums like Kayole At the clinic, Adama was reunited with Auma and her assistant. ""They said the baby looked OK and if the client wanted him he would be taken straightaway,"" she said. Adama had made a painful choice to sell her child. Now she was reconsidering. ""I did not want to sell my baby to someone who would not be able to take care of him, or someone who buys babies to go use them for other things,"" she said later. So Adama left the clinic that day carrying her baby boy. She dropped him instead at the government-run children's hospital, where he would wait for foster parents and, she hoped, a better life. She never got the money she needed. She lives alone now, away from Nairobi, and sometimes she dreams about her son and wakes in the early hours and thinks about him. Sometimes, if she can't get back to sleep, she walks down the road in the dark until she finds someone else awake. But she doesn't regret her choice. ""I feel at peace to have given my baby to the government,"" she said, ""because I know he is safe."" Fred Leparan, the clinical social worker at the government hospital, called to say he had identified a baby boy given up by his mother that he wanted to steal for us. The boy was one of three children at the hospital waiting to be transferred to a nearby children's home. It was Leparan's job to ensure they got there safely. But Leparan knew that once the babies left Mama Lucy hospital, there was only a slim chance anyone from there would check they had arrived at the home. At the hospital, Leparan filled out the necessary paperwork and made small talk with the staff, who had no idea that a child was being stolen on their watch. Rose, the undercover reporter, was waiting in a car outside. Leparan told the hospital nurses she worked for the children's home and asked them to take the babies out to her. He seemed increasingly anxious, but he assured our source that the nurses would not follow them. ""No, they can't, they have work to do,"" he said. Then he urged the team to leave quickly. ""If we keep chatting like this someone may suspect,"" he said. This video can not be played Fred Leparan orchestrates the transfer of the child at Mama Lucy Moments later, the team drove out of Mama Lucy hospital with three infant children in the car and instructions to deliver just two of them to the children's home. From there, the third baby could have gone anywhere, to anyone. The undercover team delivered all three children safely to the home, where they will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. Later that afternoon, Leparan called Rose to a meeting and instructed her to place the agreed 300,000 shillings on the table. He instructed her to see a nutritionist. ""The only thing to keep an eye on is the boy's vaccine mark,"" he said. ""Also, be careful. Be very careful."" The BBC confronted Fred Leparan about this transaction but he refused to comment. The hospital also declined requests to comment, and Leparan appears to have kept his job. We also informed a children's rights NGO about Mary Auma's illegal street clinic in Kayole, which in turn informed the police. But Auma appears to still be in business. She did not respond when we put our allegations to her. And we attempted to put our allegations to Anita, but she seemed to have once again disappeared into the shadows of the street. ""We all want to be mothers to our children,"" Rebecca said. ""It is not our fault we are in the streets."" For the mothers whose children were stolen, there will never be any real resolution. Most go on in limbo, hoping to see their child again, knowing that they probably won't. Rebecca would give ""everything"" to see her son, she said. ""And if he died I would like to know too."" Last year, she heard that someone saw a boy in a distant neighbourhood of Nairobi that looked just like her eldest daughter, Lawrence Josiah's sister. Rebecca knew it was probably nothing, and she had no way of getting to the neighbourhood and no idea where to look if she did. She did get as far as the local police station, but she couldn't get any help, she said, and eventually she gave up. ""There is a one in a million chance these women will see their children again,"" said Maryana Munyendo, from Missing Child Kenya. ""Many of the street mothers are children themselves, and they are taken advantage of in their vulnerability."" People like Rebecca were too often not seen as sympathetic victims of crime, Munyendo said. ""But nobody should assume that people on the street do not have feelings, that they do not deserve justice. They do have feelings. The way you miss your child if you live in a suburban area is the same way you miss your child if you are a mother on the street."" Some of the babies stolen from the street will end up in those suburban areas. Sometimes Rebecca thinks about the wealthier women who paid for them â about what it takes to raise a child you know was stolen from someone else. ""What are they thinking?"" she said. ""How do they feel?"" Additional reporting by Kassim Mohamed and Elijah Kanyi. Photographs by Brian Inganga. All images copyright Imported for my body: Trafficked to India for sex.

He could, she knows in her heart, be dead. The last time she saw him, Lawrence Josiah, her firstborn son, he was one. She was 16. It was about 2am one night in March 2011 and Rebecca was drowsy from sniffing a handkerchief doused in jet fuel â a cheap high on the city's streets. She sniffed jet fuel because it gave her the confidence to go up to strangers and beg. By the time Rebecca was 15, her mother could no longer support her or pay her school fees and she dropped out and slid into life on the street. She met an older man who promised to marry her but instead made her pregnant and left. The following year Lawrence Josiah was born, and Rebecca raised him for a year and a few months until she closed her eyes that night and never saw him again. ""Even though I have other kids, he was my firstborn, he made me a mother,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I have searched in every children's centre, in Kiambu, Kayole, and I have never found him."" Rebecca still lives on the same streets in Nairobi. She is small, with sharp cheekbones and short, tightly braided hair. She has three more children now â girls aged eight, six, and four. The youngest girl was grabbed once, she said, by a man who'd been hanging around the area, and claimed the barely one-year-old girl had asked him to buy her a drink. Rebecca followed him to a car afterwards, she said, where a woman was waiting. The next day, he was back. Rebecca and her youngest girl. ""You have to be alert,"" she said. ""The rich people will steal your baby as you sleep"" You do not have to look hard to find similar stories around the streets where Rebecca lives, alongside other unhoused Nairobi residents. Esther's three-year-old son disappeared in August 2018. ""I have never been at peace since I lost my child,"" she said. ""I have searched for him all the way to Mombasa."" It's been five years since Carol's two-year-old son was snatched in the middle of the night. ""I loved him so much,"" she said. ""I would forgive them if they would just give me back my child."" Vulnerable women are being preyed on in Nairobi to feed a thriving black market for babies. Over the course of a year-long investigation, Africa Eye has found evidence of children being snatched from homeless mothers and sold for massive profits. We uncovered illegal child trafficking in street clinics and babies being stolen to order at a major government-run hospital. And in an effort to expose those abusing government positions, we arranged to purchase an abandoned child from a hospital official, who used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week old boy before selling him directly to us. The baby-stealers range from vulnerable opportunists to organised criminals â often both elements working together. Among the opportunists are women like Anita, a heavy drinker and drug user who herself lives on and off the street, and makes money stealing children from women like Rebecca â targeting mothers with infants under the age of three. Africa Eye found out about Anita through a friend of hers, who wanted to remain anonymous. The friend, who asked to be called Emma, said Anita had different methods for snatching children on the street. ""Sometimes she will speak to the mother first, to try and see if the mother knows what she plans to do,"" Emma said. ""Sometimes she will drug the mother, give her sleeping pills or glue. Sometimes she will play with the kid. ""Anita has a lot of ways to get kids."" Emma helped expose a woman she knew stealing babies from unsuspecting street mothers Posing as potential buyers, Africa Eye set up a meeting with Anita in a pub in downtown Nairobi frequented by street sellers. Anita told us she was under pressure from her boss to steal more children, and she described a recent abduction. ""The mother was new to the streets, she seemed to be confused, not aware of what was going on,"" she said. ""She trusted me with her child. Now I have the child."" Anita said her boss was a local businesswoman who bought stolen babies from petty criminals and sold them for a profit. Some of the customers were ""women who are barren, so for them this is a kind of adoption,"" she said, but ""some use them for sacrifices"". ""Yes, they are used for sacrifices. These children just disappear from the streets and they are never seen again."" That dark hint echoed something Emma had already told us, that Anita said some buyers ""take the kids for rituals"". In reality, once Anita has sold a child on, she knows little about its fate. She charges the businesswoman 50,000 shillings for a girl or 80,000 shillings for a boy, she said â Â£350 or Â£550. That is roughly the going rate in Nairobi to steal a child from a woman on the street. ""The businesswoman, she never says the business she does with the kids,"" Emma said. ""I asked Anita does she know what the woman does with them, and she told me she could not care less whether she takes them to witchcraft or whatever. As long as she has money, she does not ask."" Soon after the first meeting, Anita called to arrange another. When we arrived, she was sitting with a baby girl who she said was five months old and she had just snatched moments before, after winning the mother's trust. ""She gave it to me for a second and I ran away with it,"" she said. Anita said she had a buyer lined up to purchase the girl for 50,000 shillings. Emma, our source, attempted to intervene, saying she had been introduced to a buyer who could pay 80,000. ""That is good,"" Anita said. ""Let's seal the deal up for tomorrow."" This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings A meeting was set for 5pm. Because a child's life was in danger, Africa Eye informed the police, who set up a sting operation to arrest Anita and rescue the child, once our buyer had met her. It was likely to be the last opportunity to secure this baby girl before she disappeared. But Anita never showed up, and despite trying for days we were unable to find her. Weeks later, Emma finally tracked her down. She told us Anita said she had found a higher bidder and used the money to build a two-room, tin-sheet house in one of the city's slums. The child was gone. The police still have an open file on Anita. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in Kenya â no government reports, no comprehensive national surveys. The agencies responsible for finding missing children and tracking the black market are under-resourced and under-staffed. One of the few safeguards for mothers whose children are taken is Missing Child Kenya, an NGO founded and run by Maryana Munyendo. In its four years in operation, the organisation has worked on about 600 cases, Munyendo said. ""This is a very big issue in Kenya but it is under-reported. At Missing Child Kenya we have barely scratched the surface."" The issue had ""not been prioritised in action response plans for social welfare,"" she said. That is partly because this is a crime whose victims tend to be vulnerable, voiceless women like Rebecca, who do not have the resources or social capital to draw media attention or drive action from the authorities. ""The under-reporting has a strong correlation to the economic status of the victims,"" Munyendo said. ""They lack the resources, networks and information to be able go somewhere and say, 'Hey, can someone follow up on my missing child?'"" The driving force behind the black market is a persistent cultural stigma around infertility. ""Infertility is not a good thing for a woman in an African marriage,"" Munyendo said. ""You are expected to have a child and it should be a boy. If you can't, you might get kicked out of your home. So what do you do? You steal a child."" A boy in the Nairobi slum Kayole, where child trafficking is ""booming"", a local journalist said A woman in that situation will most likely be put in touch with a trafficker like Anita's boss, who uses vulnerable people like Anita to snatch children on the street. Or they might be connected to someone with access to a hospital. According to Africa Eye's research, child-trafficking rings are operating within the walls of some of Nairobi's biggest government-run hospitals. Through a source, we approached Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. It is Leparan's job to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable children born at Mama Lucy. But our source said Leparan was directly involved in trafficking. The source arranged to meet Leparan, and told him he knew of a woman desperate to purchase a child after failing to conceive. ""I have this baby boy in the hospital,"" Leparan replied. ""They dropped him off two weeks ago and never came back."" According to our source, this was not the first time Leparan had arranged to sell a child. ""The last case scared me,"" Leparan said in the meeting, which Africa Eye recorded. ""Suppose we do this, I want a plan that won't cause us problems later on,"" he said. Fred Leparan accepted 300,000 Kenyan shillings to steal a child from Mama Lucy hospital Children like the abandoned baby boy on offer from Leparan should be taken to a government children's home while they are placed officially with foster parents who have been subject to background and welfare checks. When they are sold illegally by people like Fred Leparan, nobody really knows where they will end up. Posing as a woman called Rose, an undercover reporter working for Africa Eye met Leparan at an office close to the hospital. Leparan asked a few cursory questions about Rose's status. She said she was married but could not conceive, and was under pressure from her husband's family to give birth. ""Have you tried adoption?"" Leparan asked. ""We thought about it but it seems like it is a bit complicated,"" Rose replied. With that, Leparan agreed. The price would be 300,000 shillings â Â£2,000. ""If we go ahead with this deal it will only be the three of us - me, you and him,"" he said, pointing to Rose and our source. ""My issue is trusting someone. It is very risky. It worries me a lot."" He said he would be in touch to arrange the sale. Between the street snatchers like Anita and the corrupt officials like Leparan, there is another layer to Nairobi's child-trafficking business. Dotted around some of the city's slums you can find illegal street clinics with delivery rooms for expectant mothers. These makeshift clinics are a known location for the black-market trade in babies. Working with a local journalist, Judith Kanaitha of Ghetto Radio, Africa Eye approached a clinic in Nairobi's Kayole neighbourhood, home to thousands of the city's poorest residents. According to Kanaitha, the baby trade is booming in Kayole. The clinic we approached is operated by a woman known as Mary Auma, who said she had worked as a nurse in some of Nairobi's biggest hospitals. Kanaitha posed as a buyer. Inside the clinic, two women were already in labour. ""This one, she is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she is almost ready to deliver,"" Auma said, whispering. She offered to sell the unborn child to Kanaitha for 45,000 shillings â Â£315. Auma did not appear concerned for the mother's welfare after the birth. ""As soon as she gets her money, she will go,"" she said, waving her hand. ""We make it clear, they never come back."" This video can not be played Mary Auma negotiates the sale at her street clinic The woman in the clinic that day whose unborn baby Auma was negotiating for sale was Adama. Adama was broke. Like Rebecca, she had been abandoned by the man who got her pregnant, and the pregnancy had cost her her job on a construction site when she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. So Adama decided to sell her baby. Mary Auma was not offering her the 45,000 shillings she was attempting to charge us. She told Adama the deal was for just 10,000 â Â£70. ""Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,"" Adama said later, in an interview in her village. ""But I was desperate and I didn't have a choice."" Adama said that the day we walked into the clinic, Mary Auma had just induced her, without warning, by giving her tablets to swallow. Auma had a buyer and was keen to make a sale. But the birth was not smooth. The baby boy had chest issues and Auma told Adama to take him to Mama Lucy hospital for treatment. After two weeks, Adama was discharged with the baby. She texted Auma, and Auma texted us. ""New package has been born,"" she wrote. ""45,000k."" Illegal street clinics dot the Nairobi slums like Kayole At the clinic, Adama was reunited with Auma and her assistant. ""They said the baby looked OK and if the client wanted him he would be taken straightaway,"" she said. Adama had made a painful choice to sell her child. Now she was reconsidering. ""I did not want to sell my baby to someone who would not be able to take care of him, or someone who buys babies to go use them for other things,"" she said later. So Adama left the clinic that day carrying her baby boy. She dropped him instead at the government-run children's hospital, where he would wait for foster parents and, she hoped, a better life. She never got the money she needed. She lives alone now, away from Nairobi, and sometimes she dreams about her son and wakes in the early hours and thinks about him. Sometimes, if she can't get back to sleep, she walks down the road in the dark until she finds someone else awake. But she doesn't regret her choice. ""I feel at peace to have given my baby to the government,"" she said, ""because I know he is safe."" Fred Leparan, the clinical social worker at the government hospital, called to say he had identified a baby boy given up by his mother that he wanted to steal for us. The boy was one of three children at the hospital waiting to be transferred to a nearby children's home. It was Leparan's job to ensure they got there safely. But Leparan knew that once the babies left Mama Lucy hospital, there was only a slim chance anyone from there would check they had arrived at the home. At the hospital, Leparan filled out the necessary paperwork and made small talk with the staff, who had no idea that a child was being stolen on their watch. Rose, the undercover reporter, was waiting in a car outside. Leparan told the hospital nurses she worked for the children's home and asked them to take the babies out to her. He seemed increasingly anxious, but he assured our source that the nurses would not follow them. ""No, they can't, they have work to do,"" he said. Then he urged the team to leave quickly. ""If we keep chatting like this someone may suspect,"" he said. This video can not be played Fred Leparan orchestrates the transfer of the child at Mama Lucy Moments later, the team drove out of Mama Lucy hospital with three infant children in the car and instructions to deliver just two of them to the children's home. From there, the third baby could have gone anywhere, to anyone. The undercover team delivered all three children safely to the home, where they will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. Later that afternoon, Leparan called Rose to a meeting and instructed her to place the agreed 300,000 shillings on the table. He instructed her to see a nutritionist. ""The only thing to keep an eye on is the boy's vaccine mark,"" he said. ""Also, be careful. Be very careful."" The BBC confronted Fred Leparan about this transaction but he refused to comment. The hospital also declined requests to comment, and Leparan appears to have kept his job. We also informed a children's rights NGO about Mary Auma's illegal street clinic in Kayole, which in turn informed the police. But Auma appears to still be in business. She did not respond when we put our allegations to her. And we attempted to put our allegations to Anita, but she seemed to have once again disappeared into the shadows of the street. ""We all want to be mothers to our children,"" Rebecca said. ""It is not our fault we are in the streets."" For the mothers whose children were stolen, there will never be any real resolution. Most go on in limbo, hoping to see their child again, knowing that they probably won't. Rebecca would give ""everything"" to see her son, she said. ""And if he died I would like to know too."" Last year, she heard that someone saw a boy in a distant neighbourhood of Nairobi that looked just like her eldest daughter, Lawrence Josiah's sister. Rebecca knew it was probably nothing, and she had no way of getting to the neighbourhood and no idea where to look if she did. She did get as far as the local police station, but she couldn't get any help, she said, and eventually she gave up. ""There is a one in a million chance these women will see their children again,"" said Maryana Munyendo, from Missing Child Kenya. ""Many of the street mothers are children themselves, and they are taken advantage of in their vulnerability."" People like Rebecca were too often not seen as sympathetic victims of crime, Munyendo said. ""But nobody should assume that people on the street do not have feelings, that they do not deserve justice. They do have feelings. The way you miss your child if you live in a suburban area is the same way you miss your child if you are a mother on the street."" Some of the babies stolen from the street will end up in those suburban areas. Sometimes Rebecca thinks about the wealthier women who paid for them â about what it takes to raise a child you know was stolen from someone else. ""What are they thinking?"" she said. ""How do they feel?"" Additional reporting by Kassim Mohamed and Elijah Kanyi. Photographs by Brian Inganga. All images copyright Imported for my body: Trafficked to India for sex.

"Two new Covid testing 'mega labs' in early 2021The labs will use technology to speed up the process so results come faster, the government says.UK","Two new ""mega labs"" will open in early 2021 with the aim of doubling the UK's daily coronavirus testing capacity, the government has said. The sites - at Leamington Spa in the Midlands and another at an unconfirmed site in Scotland - will increase testing capacity by 600,000. The latest data shows,externalcurrent capacity is around 519,000 - although the number of tests actually processed is lower. Meanwhile, Labour is calling for a national plan to roll out the vaccine. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccination programme will probably be the largest logistical operation since World War Two - and called for a plan setting out who will be eligible for a jab and when. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Coronavirus testing explained Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but the government's system has experienced setbacks during the pandemic. In recent weeks, the governmenthas started to pilot mass testing- including people with no symptoms - using a new type of rapid swab tests which do not need to be sent to a lab. However, the bulk of the UK's testing still uses the standard swab test that need to be analysed in a lab. Announcing the two new ""mega labs"", the government said they will use technology to speed up the process - for example through automation and robotics. ""This means more tests will be processed more quickly and at a lower cost, and therefore faster turnaround times for test results,"" the Department of Health said. The sites will create up to 4,000 jobs, with the labs also being used to process tests for other illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. They would each add 300,000 to the UK's daily testing capacity - defined as how many tests can be processed in the lab each day - when operating at maximum. The testing capacity is different to how many tests are actually processed. For example, the latest figures for Friday showed that although the UK's capacity was 519,951, the number of tests carried out was 379,955. Officialshave previously saidit is natural that not all the capacity is used up, and there needs to be flexibility in the system to cope with surges in demand or problems with equipment or staff. On the face of it the planned new ""mega labs"" will mark a significant boost to UK testing capacity. The current capability of 500,000 tests a day will be more than doubled when the two labs are up and running. But the big unanswered question is when? The timing is vague with only an aim for an opening early next year. The site for the Scottish lab has not yet been announced. Previous pledges on testing capacity have not always been met. A new ""lighthouse lab"" at Charnwood in the East Midlands was due to open in early October. That didn't happen although government sources say it will come online ""in the coming months"" along with three others. Plans are one thing. Delivery is another. More details of the ""mega labs"" will be closely scrutinised when they are published. ""We didn't go into this crisis with a significant diagnostics industry, but we have built one, and these two mega labs are another step forward,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""These mega labs are future-proofing our national infrastructure to respond to future epidemics and improving care for other diseases."" The Scotland lab - which will be rolled out after Leamington Spa - will create about 1,800 jobs, the Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said. Its location is yet to be confirmed. She described the establishment of the mega lab as ""an important step in our fight against the virus"" that will ""significantly"" increase testing and diagnostic capacity. Ms Freeman added: ""The facility, which will follow on from the lab in Leamington Spa, will also have the flexibility to provide diagnostic capability in the future for other diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and will support Scotland's growing precision medicine industry."" Separately,the NHS announced,externalit is launching 40 clinics specialising in ""long Covid"" which will start opening at the end of November. The condition is thought to affect more than 60,000 people in the UK. Meanwhile, hope continues that a Covid vaccine will be rolled out in coming months. At the weekend, the co-founder of pharmaceutical company BioNTech, whose vaccine with Pfizer has shown positive early results, said life should be back to normal by next winter. Prof Ugur Sahin saidif everything continued to go well, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"". This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" Labour's Sir Keir has called on Boris Johnson to publish a national action plan for rolling out a vaccine ""that harnesses all of the talents of the British people: our businesses, nurses, doctors, scientists and public servants"". He said the government should consider supporting councils to refurbish town halls or sport centres into local vaccine clinics, and also launch a nationwide public health campaign to crack down on vaccine fake news. ""We are world leaders in vaccines, and I believe we should be aiming for a world class programme for rolling it out,"" he said. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Last week, BioNTech and Pfizer became the first vaccine developers to share preliminary analysis that showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. Their vaccine is one of 11 in the final stages of testing. However, there is no data yet to show how well the jab works in the elderly, and it is also not known if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick. The UK has ordered enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Theagency's head has saidit would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the UK's number of people who have died to 51,934.

New homes plan revised after Tory backlashA formula for housing targets in England led to upset from MPs - now changes are expected.UK Politics,"The government is set to revise its proposals for controversial planning reforms in England, after new housing targets prompted a backlash amongst some senior Conservative MPs. Ministers have proposed updating the formula for where to build houses to meet its aim of delivering more homes. But some said the ""mutant algorithm"" would fail to ""level up"" the North and see the South ""concreted over"". Critics of the proposal include former Prime Minister Theresa May. She said the new formula ""does not guarantee a single extra home being built"". May attacks 'ill-conceived' planning reforms Government won't cut 300,000 homes target, says housing secretary Johnson defends 'long overdue' planning overhaul In the House of Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he would make a statement on revised plans ""in the weeks ahead"". He told MPs the Covid crisis was causing the ""most substantial change to city centres and town centres since the Second World War and that does give us pause for reflection"". The government would ""consider what those opportunities will be for the repurposing of offices into residential, for turning retail into mixed use and that will, I think, lead us to a different approach to distributing housing numbers across the country,"" he said. The new formula was proposed as part of wider government planning reforms. They include a target to build 300,000 new homes across England each year by the mid-2020s, with the formula providing a rough estimate to local councils on how many need to be built in their communities. Mr Jenrick has said local authorities will then be expected to come forward with potential sites for new buildings - taking into account constraints, such as areas protected by the green belt. But several Tory MPs have expressed concern that the government's plan could mean more homes in rural areas and in the South East, rather than the North and Midlands. While the 300,000 target remains ""undiminished"", the government says it has listened to the feedback of critical MPs and ministers are looking to ""rebalance"" the formula. It is thought the focus will shift towards building more homes in the North and Midlands, and in urban areas or city centres - where the coronavirus pandemic has potentially accelerated a longer-term drop in demand for office and retail spaces. It does not mean there will not still be new homes built in the South East. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who met Mr Jenrick this week to raise his concerns about the formula, thanked his colleague on Twitter for ""listening to the concerns of me and many other MPs"". He added: ""We support your desire for more houses to help young people get on the housing ladder and will work with you to make sure a revised algorithm achieves that."" Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight Bob Seely, who led calls for a change to the plan - and secured a recent Commons debate on the issue - told the BBC he also welcomed the fact the government was willing to listen to the ""strength of feeling and depth of concern"" backbenchers had. But he said it now had to work with MPs and ""rethink"" as the UK needed ""levelling up, not concreting out."" Former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers also said the change in approach from government was ""encouraging"", but ""a few tweaks are not enough"". She said: ""We need radical change to the proposal if we're to ensure that this algorithm doesn't lead to unacceptable overdevelopment."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson has defended his proposals for overhauling the planning system. Meanwhile, sources from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government have also confirmed the department is looking to move a ""proportion"" of its operations to the West Midlands, with Wolverhampton understood to be the preferred location. This would involve moving ministerial offices and senior officials, although ministers would still spend time in Westminster. Next year has been described as a ""ball park"" timeline for the move.
