What is the UK's plan and what could happen next?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

Holes remain in government's bold virus plans,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a package of financial measures to support the economy on Tuesday As we discussed earlier, the government had to act credibly, and act fast. There is no question that offering to pump more than Â£300bn into the economy to protect it from the worst is a very serious move - the lion's share government backed loans, with around Â£20bn of grants and tax cuts too. You can't question the government's intention tonight to show boldness and to show intent that they will do ""whatever it takes"" (the chancellor and the PM's mantra) not just to support the health of the country, but our livelihoods too. Rarely, but every now and then, there is a day in Westminster when it feels like the landscape has transformed - and this is one of them. Not just because the size of the promises is vast and represents a huge extension of state intervention in the economy; also, it will have massive implications for the taxpayer for years and years to come. One insider whispered to me that the moves could end up with the government essentially supporting every UK business in one way or another, and the national debt ballooning once again. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Together with sweeping new powersin the government's emergency legislation, which also deserves careful scrutiny, the government is clearly buckling up for a period of profound disruption and change, and that will see ministers' roles become much more central in all of our lives. There are still holes in the vast plans - it's not yet clear what will happen to people who rent their homes rather than have mortgages. Can businesses who are making decisions right now about whether they need to shut up shop possibly get money and support fast enough to stave off the worst? Can families who have lost their sources of income get help quickly so they can pay the bills right now? There is pressure on the ministers to answer these, and many other questions as quickly as they can. But with the government announcing enormous and expensive emergency promises, planes grounded, hospital operations cancelled, even religious worship curtailed, for now, even if on a temporary basis, the UK is changing before our eyes.

What are shops doing about stockpiling?,"People have been stockpiling food, supermarket online delivery slots are full, items are restricted in stores and vulnerable people are being sent food parcels by the government. So what is being done to make sure people can get food? A total of one-and-a-half million people in England have been identified as being extremely medically vulnerable. The government has contacted 900,000 of these and has started distributing free weekly food parcels to those who have no family or friends to help them. This could eventually total more than 50,000 people. The identical parcels contain essential supplies including pasta, cereal, fruit, tea bags, and toilet paper. There have been concerns about healthy over-70s or people with other medical conditions not finding themselves eligible for these parcels. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are working quickly to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies."" In Wales, people who are extremely vulnerable will receive a letter from the country's chief medical officer. If nobody can help them get food,then from this week they can request a free weekly food box.,external Detail on schemes being set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to be announced in the coming days. Branches of the main supermarkets have introduced policies to keep customers at a safe distance from one other. These include having somebody on the door controlling customer numbers, and spacing out those queuing outside. Inside, many supermarkets are providing hand sanitiser for customers and floor markers for till queues. In addition, some are putting up screens between the cashiers and the public. Other initiatives includeTescointroducing floor markings showing which direction to walk down the aisles in some of its larger stores.Morrisonshas a queuing zone if there are too many customers to be separated by the floor markings, whileAsdais bringing in directional barriers. Empty shelves caused by panic buying led to the supermarkets imposing restrictions on how many of individual items customers could buy. However, with stock levels improving, on Tuesday, Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda lifted some of the limits. Sainsbury's will start to remove restrictions on some of its items from Sunday, while Tesco and Co-op are not changing their current restriction policies. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The supermarkets have introduced allotted times of the day when only the elderly, vulnerable and disabled, or NHS staff and other key workers, can shop. Several food retailers are""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell.They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, Morrisons is launching a pre-order food box collection service for NHS staff. This has been a sticking point for many people who, despite following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request tostay at home and use online deliveries, find themselves unable to book slots. Tesco,which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click-and-collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. The supermarket has also suspended all fees on its Delivery Saver scheme until it can offer its full service again. Asdais also recruiting more delivery drivers, whileSainsbury'shas offered priority booking slots to more than 450,000 elderly and vulnerable customers. Morrisonsis creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, whileWaitrosesays it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers. Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together. They can now share resources like distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, and co-ordinate stock levels across the country. Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries. Why are people stockpiling toilet paper?

Coronavirus and ibuprofen: Separating fact from fiction,"Stories have been circulating online suggesting it's dangerous to take ibuprofen if you have coronavirus. Alongside genuine medical advice, false messages have been spreading, distorting the facts. Speaking to the BBC, medical professionals said that ibuprofen is not recommended for managing coronavirus symptoms. The NHS says that, while ""there is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse, until we have more information take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you."" Those already taking ibuprofen for other conditions should not stop without consulting a doctor, though. Both paracetamol and ibuprofen can bring a temperature down and help with flu-like symptoms. But ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not suitable for everyone and can cause side-effects - especially for people with asthma, heart and circulatory problems. The NHS website previously recommended both paracetamol and ibuprofen, but has since changed its advice. There is also some evidence linking ibuprofen to more severe illness from other respiratory infections. But whatever the advice, there's still been a great deal of misinformation online. Bogus messages have been circulating on WhatsApp claiming that: â¢           ""There are four young people in an intensive care unit in Cork who have no underlying illnesses - all were taking anti-inflammatories and there are concerns this has caused a more severe illness""(false) â¢           The University of Vienna has sent a memo warning people with coronavirus symptoms not to take ibuprofen, ""because it has been discovered that it increases the speed of reproduction of the coronavirus Covid-19 in the body and this is the reason why people in Italy have reached the current bad stage and rapid spread""(false) â¢           ""At the university hospital in Toulouse, France, there are four very critical cases of coronavirus in [young people] who do not have any health problems. Their problem is that when they all appeared to have symptoms, they all took painkillers like ibuprofen""(false) These stories circulating on WhatsApp are also appearing on different platforms including Instagram. Commonly these kinds of copied-and-pasted texts will claim to be from someone the forwarder says they know, often with a medical background. The Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland said a WhatsApp message circulating about coronavirus patients in Cork is ""a fake message"", asking anyone who receives it to ""ignore and delete"".

Toulouse University Hospital warned that inaccurate information was circulating on social networks, saying it would not have discussed the care of patients due to medical confidentiality. There has been no research into ibuprofen and the new coronavirus (Covid-19). But there has been some for other respiratory infections, suggesting ibuprofen is linked to more complications and more severe illness, according to Paul Little, a professor of primary care research at University of Southampton. Experts believe that ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory properties may ""dampen"" the body's immune response. Prof Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading says: ""There are many studies that suggest ibuprofen use during a respiratory infection can result in worsening of the disease or other complications."" But, she says, ""I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25 year old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications."" Although we don't yet know whether ibuprofen has a particular effect on the severity or length of illnesses caused by coronavirus - either in healthy people or those with underlying conditions - Dr Charlotte Warren-Gash, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says, especially for vulnerable patients, ""it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice"". Paracetamol has sold out in many pharmacies Worries over the use of ibuprofen appear to have surfaced in France, after Jean-Louis Montastruc, a doctor at Toulouse University Hospital warned on Twitter that: ""In this period of coronavirus, it is necessary to remember the risk of complications of the NSAIDs in case of fever or infection."" A subsequent tweet by France's health minister, Olivier Veran, saying that anti-inflammatory drugs ""could be an aggravating factor of the infection"" was shared more than 43,000 times.  But he also said people should consult a doctor before stopping taking them. Other tweets are also being shared including one saying that ibuprofen ""may cause severe cases of the disease, even in young and middle-aged adults with no underlying conditions"" which has been shared more than 94,000 times on Twitter. Many people on social media appeared to have ""a doctor in the family"" with inside information A lack of clear consensus on the issue from the medical profession has led to mixed messages and rumours spreading online, and the University of Vienna laboratory claim noted earlier seems to have taken on a life of its own in both English and German. Twitter and Facebook posts - which seem to be cut-and-pasted and adapted by users - all claim to have a ""doctor in the family"" who has information from the Vienna lab that ""the vast majority of people who died of Covid-19 had ibuprofen in their system"". Some of the posts go on to claim that coronavirus ""thrives on ibuprofen"". There is no evidence that this is the case. This online rumour also appeared on German-language WhatsApp as voice message and text messages. These messages typically claimed to be from a young mother saying that the Vienna lab had researched Covid-19 deaths in Italy and found that the majority had self-medicated with ibuprofen. The message offers no specific evidence to back up its claims, according to German pharmaceutical news website aponet.de. ""Such a pattern is typical of conspiracy theories,"" it concludes.

Restaurants in central London have emptied since new social distancing measures were advised on Monday Hotels, pubs and restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic are being hit hard by the pandemic as travel plummets and consumers shut down their social lives. Here's what workers in the industry are facing: Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent ""We're going big"" - that was how President Donald Trump characterised the stimulus plan being worked on by his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin. While a specific figure hasn't been mentioned openly, it's thought the plan could amount to $850bn - more than the bail-out of the banks after the financial crisis. According to Mr Mnuchin, the administration is already talking to Congress with a view to passing legislation very quickly. He said he wanted direct payments to those who'd lost their jobs, with cheques going out within the next two weeks - though there will clearly be some means testing involved. The Federal Reserve, America's central bank, is also preparing to underwrite up to a trillion dollars of liquidity in the credit markets as companies struggle to find short-term borrowing to fund payroll and loans. Read more about the plans here. The UK government has acknowledged it could temporarily nationalise transport companies in an attempt to help them through the coronavirus outbreak. Some companies have warned of possible collapse and during an exchange in the House of Commons, Labour called for the transport system to be brought back into public ownership during the crisis. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs a number of ideas were being looked at, adding: âWe will work in partnership with the transport industry to keep essential services running for the public and for those who need to get to work, those who have essential business."" He continued: ""It'll be hugely challenging and we will require a lot of different responses and mechanisms in order to get there, including on occasions organisations being run by the public sector, which [Labour has] already seen in the case of trains but for a completely different reason.""  Kevin Durant is one of four Brooklyn Nets players to test positive for the virus US star basketballer Kevin Durant and three of his Brooklyn Nets teammates - so far unnamed - have tested positive for Covid-19. The entire team was tested and the Nets paid for a private company to conduct the tests. The National Basketball Association says it will notify anyone known to have had recent contact with the players, including opponents. The leagueâs 2019-2020 season was indefinitely suspended last week because of the outbreak. âWeâre going to get through this,â said Durant - one of the leagueâs top scorers - after testing positive. âEveryone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine.â The coronavirus has infected more than 185,000 people
worldwide across 159 countries and territories, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The latest figures, from the WHO and elsewhere, show that the six countries with
the most confirmed cases and deaths are: In the UK the figures are 1,950 cases and 71 deaths. Bear in mind that the true figures globally are likely to be higher
than the WHOâs, as there is typically a lag in its reporting. Also many cases involving mild symptoms are not being tested in some countries, including the UK.  Let's dig a little deeper into this. The head of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said a German company could have a vaccine ready by the autumn. But how likely is this? And what needs to happen for us to get there? So far, researchers have developed vaccines and are starting to test them. There could be human trials by the end of the year if these tests go well. But, even if a vaccine is developed before 2021, there's still a major hurdle beyond that in the shape of firms being able to successfully mass-produce doses. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. You can read more about the work to produce a vaccine here. A French scientist works to produce a new vaccine The chancellor outlined his measures alongside Boris Johnson at a Downing Street news conference The financial measures for UK companies which have lost revenue due to coronavirus come  after similar packages were unveiled by both France and the US. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised grants, relief from business rates and government-backed loans worth more than Â£300bn. On Tuesday, France announced it would guarantee hundreds of billions of euros worth of loans, alongside a 45 billion euro package to help businesses and affected employees. In the US, the White House's plans could potentially amount to $850bn and would include money to keep airlines in business; loans for small companies; and direct payments to Americans who lose their jobs. But Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, told the BBC: âItâs too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you
can do is limit the pain.â BBC presenter Sarah Montague's makeshift home studio With millions of people now working from home, many will be turning their attention to their home office set-up. From the right chair, to desk, to the perfect lamp - there's certainly a lot to consider... Things get even more complicated when you're expected to be on air. But some BBC presenters are making sure the show goes on. Our colleague Sarah Montague, who presents the World at One on Radio 4, shared the above picture of her new home studio on her living room table. And there was even a special guest appearance from this budding presenter, Pickle: Sarah Montague's dog Pickle rehearses his lines Question from Caroline Barker Caroline also asks what would be the isolating procedure if one of the newborn parents showed coronavirus symptoms. BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts says: There is little evidence about the risks to newborn babies from this
virus and, understandably, it may be difficult to isolate entirely. It is
possible to care for your baby still and do things to cut your risk of passing
on an infection. Wash your hands before touching your baby and before feeding them.
At the moment there is
no evidence that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, so itâs felt that the
well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of
transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk. Try to avoid coughing or sneezing
on your baby and avoid as much contact as you can. The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists has more advice:https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/,external The coronavirus pandemic has plunged much of the worldâs everyday life into uncertainty. If you feel like worrying about the virus, or the constant news updates about its spread, is taking a toll on your mental health you canclick here for some useful tips. It includes advice on taking social media breaks and limiting the non-crucial news you consume.   In Turkey, 19 people have been detained for making ""âunfounded and provocativeâ posts on social media about the government's handling of the outbreak. The government has also identified 93 suspects who had written posts âtargeting officials and spreading panic and fearâ, the country's interior ministry said. Turkey has closed cafes, sports venues, and suspended mass prayers in mosques. The number of confirmed cases there is 47. Question from Tanya Lucid Tanya, from Kingston-upon-Thames, wants to know if she has coronavirus and has self-isolated for 14 days, is there a chance she could catch it again. BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts
says: Experts say most people should
develop immunity, at least in the short term, after they have recovered from
coronavirus which means they shouldnât catch it again soon. There is a chance
that some people will get it more than once though. Anyone who has symptoms â a
high temperature and/or a new and persistent cough â should self-isolate to
avoid spreading it to others. If you have a coronavirus question you want
the BBC to answer, get in touch: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The German company CureVac could have a vaccine ready âtowards fall (autumn)â, EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. Experts have said it will take at least a year to 18 months to get to that stage.  Russiaâs Orthodox Church has announced new rules to improve hygiene and curb the spread of coronavirus during church services in its Moscow diocese. Worshippers have been told to refrain from kissing the communion cup, but they can still kiss icons so long as they are rubbed with disinfectant between each use. Under the new rules, officials will have to wear disposable gloves while cutting consecrated bread, and single-use cups will be introduced for zapivka, a mixture of wine and water consumed after communion. The Church previously said it would not close any buildings or cancel proceedings. But in this latest announcement, it said it would temporarily suspend Sunday schools, parish meetings and club meetings. Russia has confirmed 114 cases of coronavirus nationwide, the majority of them in Moscow. Question from Hilary Derby, 75, Solihull  BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts
says: As long as you keep a good distance
away from other people - here in the UK it is fine to go outside and enjoy the fresh air. People
should keep exercising to stay fit and going for a walk counts. If you have a coronavirus question you want
the BBC to answer, get in touch:   EU member states have agreed to close the EU's borders to all non-essential travel for 30 days, the President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced after a meeting of the EU's 27 leaders. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Read more here. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent In making his announcement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak underlined these were the first steps. Obviously the Treasury had to get this package together very, very quickly and there are still a lot of things that need to be done - including getting money to the right people. It will be reassuring up to a point - Â£330bn is a massive intervention. But for individuals worrying about their own circumstances, there will still be questions. Both the chancellor and prime minister said it so many times, that they were willing to do ""whatever it takes"", and to ""act like a war time government"". And war time is what it feels like for people watching all of this. But despite the measures introduced yesterday, the PM concluded by making it very clear, they may have to go further quite soon. Hours after announcing a big package of measures to help businesses, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak was rebuked by the House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for announcing the measures in a live TV conference before briefing MPs. Sir Lindsay said these were ""difficult and sobering times"" for the country and he did not want ""to pick a fight"". But he reminded the chancellor that ministers ""have a duty to report first"" to Parliament. Mr Sunak apologised and said all future financial announcements would be made first to MPs.

European Union seals borders amid virus fight,"The French-German border is allowing only goods and commuters to pass The EU is banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its borders amid the coronavirus crisis. The measure is expected to apply to 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. UK citizens will be unaffected. The ban came as deaths continued to soar in Italy and Spain, and France began a strict lockdown. Europe has been badly hit by the virus, which has killed 7,500 globally. More than 185,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile,the Euro 2020 football competition has been postponed by a year. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Free travel is a cherished principle within the European border-free Schengen area. But in recent days many countries have unilaterally imposed full or partial border shutdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, at the urging of French President Emmanuel Macron. A visual guide to the pandemic Britons urged to avoid non-essential travel abroad The measures were agreed in a video-summit between EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon and will now have to be implemented by member states. ""They said they will immediately do that,"" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference. ""This is good, so that we have a unanimous and united approach [where] the external borders are concerned."" The UK and the Republic of Ireland - which is part of the EU but not Schengen - will be invited to join the measure. It was also crucial that the EU ""unblocks the situation"" with regards to closed internal borders, Mrs Von der Leyen said, because ""too many people are stranded"".

US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus,"This video can not be played The US Secretary to the Treasury announced measures to help workers affected by coronavirus disruptions US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he supports sending money directly to Americans as part of a $1tn (Â£830bn) stimulus aimed at averting an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. ""We're looking at sending cheques to Americans immediately,"" he said. The $250bn (Â£207bn) in cheques are part of a huge aid package which the White House is discussing with Congress. It follows widespread school and shop closures as the number of coronavirus cases in the US approached 6,000. The US has been debating how to provide relief as activity grinds to a halt in response to curfews and other measures intended to slow the spread of the virus. Details such as the size of the cheques, and who would qualify for them, are still under discussion. Follow the latest developments here Coronavirus: Stocks bounce as volatility continues A $1tn aid package - roughly the size of the entire UK budget - would be larger than the US response to the 2008 financial crisis, amounting to nearly a quarter of what the US federal government spent last year. In addition to the $250bn in cheques for families, the plan includes a bailout for airlines and hotels, among other measures. The proposal must be approved by Congress to move forward. Wall Street rebounded sharply on Tuesdayafter the plan was announced, though not nearly enough to make up for the previous day's heavy losses. Separate from the $1tn package, Mr Mnuchin said the government would also allow companies and individuals to delay their tax payments for 90 days. ""We look forward to having bipartisan support to pass this legislation very quickly,"" he said. US President Donald Trump initially proposed a payroll tax cut, which would reduce the money the government automatically withholds from worker pay to pay for social programmes. However, critics said that relief would come too slowly and leave out those without jobs. Several high-profile economists had urged more direct assistance, including $1,000 payments, winning support from lawmakers such as Republican Senator Mitt Romney. Mr Trump said he had come round to the view that faster, more direct relief is necessary. ""With this invisible enemy, we don't want people losing their jobs and not having money to live,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he wanted to target the relief to those who need it. Mr Mnuchin said he hoped to send the cheques within two weeks. ""Americans need cash now and the president wants to give cash now and I mean now, in the next two weeks."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University who had championed the idea, wrote on Twitter that he was thrilled to see it gain traction. Speaking to the BBC earlier, he said direct payments would help, even with so many shops closed for business. ""It would enable people to not work, if that's what they need to do. It will prevent some people from not making their rent payments,"" said Mr Furman, who served as a top economic adviser under former President Barack Obama. ""There are a lot of ways to spend money that don't involve going out."" But economist Gabriel Zucman, a professor at the University of California who has advised Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, said the government should prioritise help to businesses if it wants to avoid mass layoffs and company failures. ""What the US needs is massive support to small businesses to cover wages and maintenance costs during shutdown,"" he said, adding that lawmakers could opt to do both. Allow Twitter content?

The White House push for relief comes as Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain divided about what help is necessary. It follows actions by the Federal Reserve to ease financial strains. The bank on Tuesday said it will use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tr in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis. It is also offering another $500bn in overnight loans to banks. It has previously enacted two emergency rate cuts, and other stimulus measures. US markets rallied about 6% following Tuesday's announcements after steep falls a day earlier.

Most UK cinemas shut after virus advice,"A sign in the window of a Vue cinema in Altrincham, Greater Manchester Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld, Vue and Picturehouse are shutting all their UK screens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move comes a day afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to avoid public venues. Cinema UK, which represents the industry, said,external""most UK cinema sites"" would close in the coming days following the government advice. Theatres in London's West End and around the UK have already closed, and many concerts have been called off. Odeon has more than 120 cinemas in the UK and Ireland, while Vue has 91, Cineworld has 100, and also runs 24 Picturehouse sites. The BFI's Southbank complex has also been shut. Even before the announcements, many film fans were staying away from cinemas, with UK and Ireland box office takings down 50% between Friday and Sunday compared with the previous weekend,according to Screen Daily,external. On top of that, cinemas that remain open might not have much to show. Many of the biggest new releases of the coming months, such as James Bond's No Time To Die and the new Fast and Furious film F9, have been put back in the schedules. With more people staying at home, some film studios have decided to bring forward the home streaming releases of their latest releases. On Monday, Universal Pictures said it would start making its movies available on home entertainment on the same day as the films' global theatrical releases, starting with the family animation Trolls World Tour next month. The company will also make films that are currently in cinemas available on demand, starting as early as this week. This would include such titles as The Invisible Man and Emma. The Invisible Man director and writer Leigh Whannell posted a message confirming the news on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Prime Minister was heavily criticised by the entertainment and nightlife industries on Monday, for advising people to stay away from theatres and cinemas while not forcing venues to close, which could have given them financial protection. Some independent venues, such as the Lonsdale Alhambra in Penrith, Cumbria,have decided to stay openfor now. Cinema UK said: ""The priority now is to ensure that thousands working in the sector are helped during an exceptionally challenging period for them, and that UK cinema venues are supported during what, for many, represents an unprecedented challenge to their existence."" Tate, V&A and Natural History Museum to close West End shuts down after PM's coronavirus advice Pop stars live-stream concerts to combat isolation An Odeon spokesperson said: ""In line with the latest government guidance on Covid-19, we are temporarily closing our cinemas. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and look forward to welcoming back guests as soon possible."" Cineworld Group chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""At Cineworld and Picturehouse we are committed to providing safe and healthy environments for our employees and guests and have therefore made the difficult decision to close our cinemas in UK and Ireland until further notice. ""We deeply value our cinema-loving customers and have no doubt we will be serving everyone again as soon as possible with a full slate of Hollywood blockbusters and the best of independent films and content.""

Kuenssberg: Government knows it must act fast,"""The government is about to involve itself in the lives of millions of people in ways we haven't seen since the war,"" one senior figure in government said after Cabinet this morning. You can only imagine the mood around the table as ministers absorb the scale of what we face as a country and the scale of the responsibility they hold. Whether it is urging people not to travel abroad, providing huge emergency assistance to particular industries, or telling people to stay at home, according to that Cabinet minister, we are living through a massive change in the relationship between government and the public that could last for many months. What the prime minister said barely two weeks ago, that the UK would ""likely face a challenge"", has very rapidly turned into the biggest peacetime task any modern government has faced - managing a very serious international health emergency and trying to stave off the worst of a potential economic emergency too. Avoid office, pubs and travel to stop virus - PM Budget: Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat virus Boris Johnson told his colleagues this morning: ""We are engaged in a war against the disease which we have to win."" As I write the details of exactly what the Chancellor will promise to prop the economy are still being thrashed out. Less than a week ago, Rishi Sunak unveiled a programme that made sick pay more generous, promised to scrap business rates this year for some small firms and make it easier to claim benefits for people who were at risk of losing their income. But as the pace of the outbreak has accelerated, so too has the potential for enormous economic damage. So expect later today to hear about plans for bigger interventions. There is clearly urgent demand from business large and small to help. But the priority right now may be reassurance as much as a radical final blueprint. As during the financial crisis, perhaps the details of what will be announced this afternoon matter less than the promise of a comprehensive approach that genuinely will provide support to every part of the economy and every part of the country. It is also worth remembering that the financial system itself is in a much, much more robust state than it was then. But there is no spreadsheet that can capture the potential for disruption and hardship here, no set of calculations that can accurately predict what will happen to the economy. There is no end date to the epidemic, no precise sense of when we will hit the peak of the infections, although Whitehall sources still believe it is maybe a couple of months away. But the government knows that it has to act, very fast, and very credibly. One senior Treasury source said: ""There aren't options to let this float around - we have to take control because it is so unprecedented."" In the last 24 hours, Downing Street's instructions to the public to protect everyone's health changed at breakneck speed as new scientific data emerged. Now the government's approach to how the country makes its living is changing too. LATEST:Follow live updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Meanwhile, in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£330bn in financial helpfor UK firms affected by the outbreak. The outgoing head of the Office For Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has said a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee he said it was better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would guarantee â¬300bn of loans, and pledged that no French company would be allowed to collapse. Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain have also all announced hundreds of billions of dollars in government relief. Live: Latest business reaction to coronavirus Vauxhall factories shut over coronavirus fears Airlines cancel most flights as coronavirus spreads The scale of the US response - from both the central bank and the government - has been the most aggressive, even if many details remain unknown, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The good news is they're talking about it now, which is more than I can say about the Japanese or the Europeans,"" he said. ""It's too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Asian shares continued to see volatile trading on with markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai swinging between losses and gains. The turbulence follows one of the worst days in history for US markets.The Dow Jones lost close to 13% and the S&P 500 fell almost 12%, marking the biggest one-day falls for both indexes since ""Black Monday"" in 1987. That followed the US Federal Reserve making another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting central banks around the world to ease policy in the biggest co-ordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. In the last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has racked up the five biggest one-day points falls in its 135-year history. In March alone the index has also seen its four biggest one-day points gains on record. Wall Street's so-called ""Fear Gauge"" has just topped the levels seen during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, surged by almost 43%, surpassing the level seen in 2008.

What are your rights if working from home?,"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

"Chancellor unveils Â£330bn in support for economyRishi Sunak announces ""unprecedented"" help for companies as the economy goes through an ""economic emergency"".Business","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" The government has unveiled a package of financial measures to shore up the economy against the coronavirus impact. It includes Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial Â£330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"". He added: ""This a time to be bold, to have courage. We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses... We will do whatever it takes."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Sunak said: ""Some sectors are facing particularly acute challenges. In the coming days, my colleague the Secretary of State for Transport and I will discuss a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports."" The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was Â£330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP. And that is because the self-isolation and suppression moves announced yesterday will remove a chunk of our economy. At a stroke, every single forecast number in the Budget the chancellor gave less than a week ago are out of date. We are in an entirely new world. A wartime effort, with wartime deficits to cover it. It's not just there will be less tax and more income support required, which typically causes deficits to spike in recessions. Now we face the need for subsidy and provision of incomes in these very tough times. This is not a bailout. It's a very expensive bridge that the government cannot afford to fail to build. Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print. Like several sectors, the aviation industry has warned it is in a fight for survival as travel bans are put in place and travellers delays bookings. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, said Mr Sunak's measure were welcome, but added: ""Airlines are facing significant pressure and without government action there is a real risk to the industry. It will be important to work through the detail, but we are already talking to government."" This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak annouces a three-month mortgage holiday ""to help people get back on their feet"" Retailers, too, have warned the future looks grim without help. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

Laura Ashley nears collapse as firms demand helpThe retailer is the latest business casualty of the pandemic as firms struggle with plunging demand.BusinessComments,"Fashion and furniture chain Laura Ashley has become the latest business casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. Just two weeks after regional airline Flybe collapsed, the retailer has said it will have to call in administrators, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It is one of the many firms reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, with the government advising people to avoid unnecessary contact with others. Its action comes as the chancellor prepares fresh support for companies. Firms from many industries including airlines, retailers, restaurants, theatres and pubs have said the virus has pushed them to the brink, with several warning of imminent collapse without government help. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already announced a Â£12bn Budget package to help businesses deal with the crisis, including business rates relief for small firm and a new hardship fund. But he said in his Budget speech he would ""not hesitate to act"" if more was needed, and he is expected to unveil new financial measures in the government's daily briefing on the outbreak on Tuesday afternoon. Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the CBI business lobby group, called for co-ordinated and fast action to support businesses. ""We do not want to look back and say we acted too late,"" she said. The bosses of sixty big High Street retailers including Top Shop owner Arcadia, Costa Coffee, JD Sports and Primark wrote to the government on Tuesday pushing for a suspension of business rates for large retailers. ""Turning specifically to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic: there is no doubt that it is already being widely felt amongst the members of this group, with footfall and turnover declining by up to 50% in many towns and shopping centres,"" the chief executives said. Earlier Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs that Britain was facing something akin to a wartime situation for its public finances. He added that now was not the time for the government to hold back on spending. Sectors which have warned of problems include: Nissan hassuspended production at its Sunderland car plant. The hospitality industry warned on Tuesday thatnew government restrictions around coronavirus could shut down firms. Cafe chain Carluccio'ssaid it could see closures ""in days"" due to the impact of the virus. Airlines have had tocancel thousands of flights and ground planesand airports have warned they may have to close down operations. The UK tourism industry is seeing a sharp drop in bookings amid travel restrictions across Europe and elsewhere. Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehousewill temporarily close their doors until further notice. Most sporting events have been suspended including Premier League football games, horse racing events, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Most businesses do not have insurance cover to compensate them for coronavirus losses, a trade body and other experts have said. Small businesses, in particular,are unlikely to have such a policy. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chairMike Cherry said: ""Many will feel like they are being made to choose between their health and the very survival of their business. Nobody should have to make this choice."" He added that the prospect for small businesses over the coming weeks ""is increasingly bleak"". However, some retailers are seeing a huge spike in demand, with Amazon workersabeing told to work overtime to tackle demand for goods.

IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Laura Ashley said the outbreak ""has had an immediate and significant impact on trading"". It had been in talks with its lenders about accessing more funds to continue trading. But based on cashflow forecasts and continued virus uncertainty, it said it would not get that money in time. The firm, which was also facing challenging High Street conditions, said: ""The Covid-19 outbreak has had an immediate and significant impact on trading, and ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation."" The outgoing head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has warned the Treasury Select Committee that some businesses will ""inevitably"" fail during the coronavirus outbreak. Far from his usual approach of urging fiscal restraint, Chote says a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible - saying it's better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). He highlighted that the government ran deficits of 20% of GDP for five years during the WW2 era (vs just under 2% of GDP last year), and said that was the right thing to do. He also urged help for those working in the gig economy. His words, coming hours before the chancellor is expected to outline more support, helped limit the fall in the FTSE 100 this morning.

Europe plans full border closure in virus battle,"France has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties The European Commission is planning to ban all non-essential travel to the European Union after more countries within the bloc closed their borders to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would ask leaders to implement the measures on Tuesday. ""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,"" she said. Meanwhile, tough new measures in France restricting movement from the home are coming into effect on Tuesday. The latest World Heath Organization (WHO) figures,externallist 173,000 infections globally and 7,000 deaths. A visual guide to the pandemic UK to unveil new financial measures to support economy They were alluded to in French President Emmanuel Macron 's televised address to his nation on Monday. He said that ""all trips between non-European countries and EU countries will be suspended"". Ms von der Leyen said that long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The measures would be in place for at least 30 days. Some 26 states are part of the Schengen agreement, which allows people to move freely between EU countries without border checks, but several countries have unilaterally closed borders in recent days in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, on the urging of Mr Macron. Citizens of non-Schengen EU member states will also be invited to apply the travel ban. Travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved. ""It is more effective and less disruptive than measures to close borders within Europe, which must be avoided to allow cross-border workers to continue their activity and essential goods to circulate in Europe,"" said Mr Macron. The proposal was to be discussed in a video-summit with EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon hosted by European Council chief Charles Michel.

Mr Macron has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties from 11:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday. He said the previous measures, including the closing of schools, cafes and non-essential shops, had proved insufficient. ""Even while medics were warning about the gravity of the situation, we saw people get together in the parks, busy markets and restaurants and bars that did not respect the order to close,"" he said in the 20-minute televised address. It was watched by a record 35.3 million people, Le Monde reported, 96% of the people watching TV at the time. ""We are at war... we're fighting neither another army nor our own nation. But the enemy is here, invisible, untouchable... and is advancing,"" he said. The country will also close its land borders from midday (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The restrictions in France will be in place for at least 15 days, Mr Macron said. Citizens must carry a form spelling out their reasons for travel and the fine for transgressors will be set soon at â¬135 ($150; Â£123). Some 100,000 civil servants and soldiers will be deployed nationwide to carry out checks.

Arena bomber's brother guilty of 22 murders,"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi has been found guilty of murdering 22 people. Hashem Abedi had denied helping to plan the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which killed or injured ""nearly 1,000"". The Old Bailey heard the pair worked together to source materials used in the suicide blast after an Ariana Grande show at the venue. Prosecutors said Hashem was ""jointly responsible"" with his brother for the attack on 22 May 2017. The Manchester-born siblings ""stood shoulder to shoulder"" in the plot, with younger sibling Hashem ""just as guilty of murder"" as the bomber himself, the court heard. The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Hashem, 22, was also found guilty of one count of attempted murder, encompassing the remaining injured, and conspiring to cause explosions. He was not in court for the unanimous verdicts after hedismissed his legal team last weekand decided to take no further part in the trial. Top (left to right): Lisa Lees, Alison Howe, Georgina Callender, Kelly Brewster, John Atkinson, Jane Tweddle, Marcin Klis, Eilidh MacLeod - Middle (left to right): Angelika Klis, Courtney Boyle, Saffie Roussos, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Martyn Hett, Michelle Kiss, Philip Tron, Elaine McIver - Bottom (left to right): Wendy Fawell, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Allen-Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones Some of the victims' family members burst into tears as the verdicts were delivered after the seven-week trial. Figen Murray, mother of victim Martyn Hett, said while the verdicts bring her ""comfort to know the British justice system has played its role...it doesn't give us closure"". His father, Paul Hett, added that while ""this verdict will not bring back the 22 victims murdered by Salman and Hashem Abedi,"" he said it will provide ""an overwhelming sense of justice to all those affected by this heinous crime"". Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Twenty-two men, women and children, aged eight to 51, were killed in the attack while 264 ""were physically injured"" and 670 more have since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"". Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said the Abedi brothers had spent ""months"" planning the blast and had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". The bomb comprised a five-litre paint can placed inside a money tin, packed with thousands of nuts and screws They worked together to source chemicals and buy screws and nails to use as ""anti-personnel shrapnel"" in experimental improvised bombs, the court was told. The brothers used 11 mobile phones in five months - some for as little as two hours - and used a variety of vehicles, despite neither passing their driving test, to transport components around the city. Afterwards, police found Hashem's fingerprints at key addresses and in a car, which still contained traces of explosives. Although he was in Libya when the device was detonated he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, Mr Penny said. This video can not be played Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi Greater Manchester Police said Hashem may have been the senior figure in the plot, and intended to cause ""further bloodshed"" around the world. The former Manchester College electrical installation student held down a series of menial jobs working in restaurants and takeaways, including a Â£5-an-hour role as a delivery driver. He was described as ""unreliable"" and ""with the wrong idea of Islam"" by his boss, before he left for his parents' home country of Libya, 2,000 miles away, a month before the bombing. Hashem was detained a day after the attack, and claimed he was subjected to torture by Libyan militiamen before his extradition two years later. He told police he was ""relieved to be back in the UK"", adding: ""[I] wish to assist in this investigation as much as I can."" He then offered ""no comment"" during police interviews. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough said Hashem was ""with his brother throughout the entire process"" of making and building the bomb and that he had taken a four-minute phone call from Salman on the night the device went off. ""At that point he (Salman) is getting that last-minute inspiration (from Hashem)...and he's telling him what he's about to do,"" he said. ""I believe he provided encouragement right up to the end. This was all about the sick ideology of Islamic State and this desire for martyrdom."" He added: ""These two brothers are literally hand in glove in this process."" Salman Abedi was seen on CCTV arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying a rucksack Following the verdicts, lawyer Victoria Higgins - representing 11 of the bereaved families - said they were relieved that the ""calculating"" killer had finally been brought to justice. ""Families have waited a long time to see Hashem Abedi face justice for his crimes and I think the overwhelming emotion for most will be one of relief that he cannot hurt anyone else,"" she said. Sentencing will take place at a later date but the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said it was a ""little way off"". A public inquiry into the bombing is due to begin in June.

Chancellor unveils Â£330bn in support for economy,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" The government has unveiled a package of financial measures to shore up the economy against the coronavirus impact. It includes Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial Â£330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"". He added: ""This a time to be bold, to have courage. We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses... We will do whatever it takes."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Sunak said: ""Some sectors are facing particularly acute challenges. In the coming days, my colleague the Secretary of State for Transport and I will discuss a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports."" The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was Â£330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP. And that is because the self-isolation and suppression moves announced yesterday will remove a chunk of our economy. At a stroke, every single forecast number in the Budget the chancellor gave less than a week ago are out of date. We are in an entirely new world. A wartime effort, with wartime deficits to cover it. It's not just there will be less tax and more income support required, which typically causes deficits to spike in recessions. Now we face the need for subsidy and provision of incomes in these very tough times. This is not a bailout. It's a very expensive bridge that the government cannot afford to fail to build. Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print. Like several sectors, the aviation industry has warned it is in a fight for survival as travel bans are put in place and travellers delays bookings. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, said Mr Sunak's measure were welcome, but added: ""Airlines are facing significant pressure and without government action there is a real risk to the industry. It will be important to work through the detail, but we are already talking to government."" This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak annouces a three-month mortgage holiday ""to help people get back on their feet"" Retailers, too, have warned the future looks grim without help. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

The road to the Manchester Arena bombing,"A CCTV image of Salman Abedi seconds before the bomb detonated The Manchester Arena suicide bombing, an attack lasting only a moment, was the endpoint of a lengthy conspiracy. At 22:30 on 22 May 2017, in a large foyer filling with people after an Ariana Grande concert, the attacker emerged from a stairway, crossed the concourse and detonated his device. Of those he walked among, 22 were killed: children, teenagers, parents. They included students, a nurse, a police officer, a support worker for those with special needs, and a school receptionist. They came from different parts of the UK and diverse backgrounds, each with their own reason for being there. Saffie Roussos, aged only eight, had attended the concert with her mother and sister. Olivia Campbell-Hardy, 15, had attended with a friend, as had 14-year-old Nell Jones. So too had Eilidh Macleod, also 14. Liam Curry and Chloe Rutherford, from South Shields, were teenage sweethearts out for the night together. Sorrell Leczkowski, 14, was in the foyer, along with her mother and grandmother, to meet her sister.

Michelle Kiss was present for the same reason, while Wendy Fawell had taken her teenage daughter and others to the concert. Elaine McIver, the police officer, was at the arena with her partner waiting to collect his daughter and her friend. Jane Tweddle, from Blackpool, was there to accompany a friend whose daughter was at the event. Kelly Brewster, from Sheffield, had attended the concert with her sister and niece. Philip Tron, from Gateshead, was there with his partner's daughter, 19-year-old student Courtney Boyle. Georgina Callander, 18, from Preston, was also a student. John Atkinson, 28, from Manchester, was there socialising, as was 29-year-old Martyn Hett, from Stockport. Megan Hurley, 15, lived in Liverpool and attended the concert with her older brother, who survived but suffered very serious injuries. Many others were also seriously injured. Salman Abedi's debit card, found at Manchester Arena after the attack The conspiracy that destroyed so many lives involved two siblings: Salman Abedi, the suicide bomber himself, and his younger brother Hashem, who was in Libya at the time of the attack. Working in tandem, the Manchester-born pair spent months preparing the atrocity. In the immediate aftermath, the official terror threat level was raised to its maximum, amid fears a bomb maker could be at large, and senior police spoke of a ""network"" when discussing the multiple arrests that took place in the UK, none of which later resulted in charges. What emerged during the lengthy police investigation was more prosaic and arguably more troubling. Salman and Hashem Abedi, two of six siblings, grew up in Manchester, the children of parents who had fled Col Gaddafi's Libya in the 1990s. Ramadan, their father, was a political radical who associated with members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group,  which was banned as a terrorist organisation and regarded as an al-Qaeda affiliate. When civil war broke out in 2011, his sons were removed from school and taken to Libya - thus exposing them to weapons and violence in the process, as they delivered aid to rebels fighting the Gaddafi regime. Salman would later return to school, completing his GCSEs, and Hashem would eventually enrol on a college course. An image of a young Hashem Abedi from his father's Facebook page Photos from the time show a youthful Hashem and his elder brother Ismael brandishing large firearms. Ramadan, his wife and their youngest children eventually based themselves in Libya, although hundreds of pounds in benefits and tax credits were still paid into her UK bank account each month, money that Salman and Hashem used during their attack planning. The two brothers, although travelling between the two countries, lived together at the former family home in Elsmore Road, with their eldest brother having got married and moved elsewhere in the city. Both were involved in gang culture and drug-taking, with Salman regarded as an aggressive, vindictive figure. In time, their ease with this lifestyle would augment their commitment to terrorism, providing the context for what was to come. After a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2015 they both became more overtly religious, but their commitment was to Islamist Jihadist violence rather than any benign expression of faith. Salman, in particular, began openly identifying with the violent revolutionary aims of the self-styled Islamic State group, which was then at the height of its influence in Syria - and claiming to its followers to be the true path of believers - killing anyone, including Muslims, who stood in its way. He was briefly investigated by the security service MI5, before being discounted as a threat, but he continued to appear as a contact of other extremists and the authorities received reports about his pro-IS mindset. Hashem (left) helped his brother Salman Abedi prepare the attack Hashem, although a regular at local mosques who lectured others on what constituted being a Muslim, carried on using drugs, drinking alcohol and partying with his friends. In summer 2016, having dropped out of college, Hashem moved to Germany to work at a property business owned by Mohammed Benhammedi - a man once sanctioned by the United Nations for financing the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group - but had returned to Manchester by the following January. It was at this point that the brothers actively embarked on their plot, renting a flat at Somerton Court in the Blackley area of Manchester, which they used over the following weeks to make the explosive TATP. Hashem Abedi after his arrest on UK soil in July 2019 The pair are believed to have followed instructions from an IS video, then accessible online, although they might also have gained relevant expertise in Libya. Hashem began asking people known to him to buy chemicals with their Amazon accounts in order to avoid the multiple purchases being traced directly back to the brothers. When requesting some purchases of sulphuric acid, Hashem claimed the chemical was needed to fill a car battery or a generator in Libya, but he lacked the necessary money and therefore needed a favour. Some people, including Hashem's contacts in Germany, refused to make the suspicious purchases. Others attempted to do so, but the purchases were declined due to a lack of funds in their own accounts. Some of the men provided accounts to police that led to them ultimately appearing as prosecution witnesses in Hashem's trial. Several other associates appeared in the evidence, but were not called as witnesses. One man, Yahya Werfalli from Manchester, provided his debit card details to Hashem, asking him ""When u doing this Amazon thing"", only to call his bank within hours claiming he knew nothing about pending transactions relating to the website. The details of Zuhir Nassrat, a friend of Hashem, were used in attempts to buy hydrogen peroxide, with one of them made from his home address. Last year, Nassrat pleaded guilty to offences of perverting the course of justice, drinking and driving, and driving without a licence or without insurance. He had earlier provided his own brother's personal details in an attempt to evade responsibility when his vehicle was stopped after he was spotted driving erratically. He has since moved to Libya. Mohammed Soliman knew both Abedi brothers Mohammed Soliman, who was employed at a takeaway where Hashem was also working, purchased 10 litres of sulphuric acid using his own Amazon account and bank details. He knew both Abedi brothers - and his relevant online activity was preceded, and followed by, contact with them. Soliman, who grew up in Libya, was stopped by counter-terrorism police at Manchester Airport on 23 March 2017 as he attempted to leave the UK. His mobile was seized and the contents were downloaded as part of that stop, but he left for Libya the following month and has not returned. The information found on his phone later formed part of the evidence at Hashem's trial. Werfalli, Nassrat and Soliman all had money deposited in their bank accounts by Hashem but the evidence in the case did not indicate if they knew or had any suspicion about what the brothers were plotting. Hashem even used his role as a takeaway delivery driver to obtain large empty cans of oil and sauce which the brothers then cut-up and manipulated to make bomb parts. He also created a Gmail address to make chemical purchases, whose title, Bedab7jeana, translates from Arabic as ""we come to slaughter"" and is the slogan of Katibat al-Battar al-Libi, an IS-linked militant group operating in Syria. Abdalraouf Abdallah was serving time at HMP Altcourse on Merseyside There was direct contact with a known extremist in the UK. The first chemical purchase of all, by a cousin who later gave evidence at trial, took place on the same day in January 2017 that Salman and two associates visited Abdalraouf Abdallah, a convicted terrorist then serving time at Altcourse prison on Merseyside. Abdallah, seen as an influence on Salman, is confined to a wheelchair due to injuries he received fighting in Libya. A dangerous radicaliser jailed for IS organising largely via a phone, Abdallah nevertheless had an illegal mobile in prison that he used to call Salman. Neither the Ministry of Justice nor G4S, the private firm that runs the prison, provided a statement when the BBC asked how it was possible for a serving terrorist prisoner to obtain a phone. Police images shows the brothers driving in Manchester during their preprations In addition to the flat for making explosives, the brothers also gained access to an empty terraced house - on Lindum Street, in a different area of Manchester - which was used to order and take delivery of 55 litres of hydrogen peroxide. Neither brother had a driving licence, yet they bought and drove three cars in the relevant period, using them to travel between the different addresses, transporting their purchases. One car, fraudulently insured in the name of their elder brother Ismael, was involved in a crash, with the pair fleeing the scene after taking care to remove an address label from a box on the back seat. Elyas Elmehdi was an associate of the Abedi brothers In early April 2017 their parents returned to Manchester, intent on taking the two brothers back to Libya. The pair made a hurried late-night effort to clean out the property where they had been making TATP, buying a cheap Nissan Micra as a form of storage, which was then parked outside the flat of an associate called Elyas Elmehdi. Salman was out of the UK for nearly five weeks. Just before flying back, he called Elmehdi, who then visited Abdalraouf in prison - the day before Salman's return. Last year Elmehdi was convicted of drugs offences, which came to light following his arrest during the Arena investigation, but he could not be jailed as he had fled to Libya. When Salman returned on 18 May 2017 he was not stopped at the airport nor subject to any scrutiny. He went straight to the Nissan Micra, checking its contents, before renting a city centre flat in which he would make his final preparations, as well as visiting the Manchester Arena as a form of reconnaissance. It had become the target. Over the following days he used a taxi to transport the explosive to his new flat, before visiting various shops to buy items for his bomb, including thousands of nuts and bolts for use as shrapnel and a rucksack in which to hide the device. A public inquiry later this year will examine any potential opportunities to prevent the attack. An official report previously recorded that on two separate occasions in the months beforehand, MI5 received intelligence which was deemed at the time to be non-terrorist activity by Salman, but can subsequently be seen as ""highly relevant to the planned attack"". On the night of 22 May he made his way to the arena, visibly weighed down by the rucksack on his back, making a final call to his family's Libyan number - almost certainly to Hashem - two hours before the attack. At 22.30, after waiting for the concert to end, he walked amongst the crowds. Salman Abedi bought thousands of nuts and screws to use as shrapnel in the bomb A militia arrested Hashem Abedi in Libya the day after the attack. Ramadan Abedi and Mohammed Soliman have also been questioned in the country, but both are now free. British investigators want to speak to Ramadan and say there are still outstanding matters in the UK, although the inquiry has done as much as it can based on the available information. It is also understood that one individual linked to the investigation has been stripped of their British citizenship Hashem has not left custody since his Libyan arrest. During pre-trial legal submissions, his lawyers said he had been subjected to torture during his time in Libya A lengthy extradition process took place, which saw him brought back to the UK last July when he was charged and sent for trial. Detectives had built an overwhelming circumstantial case: his finger-marks were in the flat used to make TATP, all over the car in which the explosives and other relevant items were stored, and on the cans that had been cut up to create parts for a bomb. He was involved in the chemicals purchases and present at every central moment of preparation. It was a joint operation. Officers had to build up a fingerprint profile using marks found on his every-day possessions, such as college books, but were only able to prove they were Hashem's on the night he returned to the UK. At trial, he displayed no emotion and gradually withdrew from the proceedings, at first apparently staying in the cells instructing his legal team, before eventually refusing to leave prison and ordering his legal team to stop representing him. This meant he was not in court - unlike some victims' families and survivors - when the jury returned its unanimous verdicts. No one in an English court has ever been convicted of so many murders.

Government knows it must act fast,"""The government is about to involve itself in the lives of millions of people in ways we haven't seen since the war,"" one senior figure in government said after Cabinet this morning. You can only imagine the mood around the table as ministers absorb the scale of what we face as a country and the scale of the responsibility they hold. Whether it is urging people not to travel abroad, providing huge emergency assistance to particular industries, or telling people to stay at home, according to that Cabinet minister, we are living through a massive change in the relationship between government and the public that could last for many months. What the prime minister said barely two weeks ago, that the UK would ""likely face a challenge"", has very rapidly turned into the biggest peacetime task any modern government has faced - managing a very serious international health emergency and trying to stave off the worst of a potential economic emergency too. Avoid office, pubs and travel to stop virus - PM Budget: Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat virus Boris Johnson told his colleagues this morning: ""We are engaged in a war against the disease which we have to win."" As I write the details of exactly what the Chancellor will promise to prop the economy are still being thrashed out. Less than a week ago, Rishi Sunak unveiled a programme that made sick pay more generous, promised to scrap business rates this year for some small firms and make it easier to claim benefits for people who were at risk of losing their income. But as the pace of the outbreak has accelerated, so too has the potential for enormous economic damage. So expect later today to hear about plans for bigger interventions. There is clearly urgent demand from business large and small to help. But the priority right now may be reassurance as much as a radical final blueprint. As during the financial crisis, perhaps the details of what will be announced this afternoon matter less than the promise of a comprehensive approach that genuinely will provide support to every part of the economy and every part of the country. It is also worth remembering that the financial system itself is in a much, much more robust state than it was then. But there is no spreadsheet that can capture the potential for disruption and hardship here, no set of calculations that can accurately predict what will happen to the economy. There is no end date to the epidemic, no precise sense of when we will hit the peak of the infections, although Whitehall sources still believe it is maybe a couple of months away. But the government knows that it has to act, very fast, and very credibly. One senior Treasury source said: ""There aren't options to let this float around - we have to take control because it is so unprecedented."" In the last 24 hours, Downing Street's instructions to the public to protect everyone's health changed at breakneck speed as new scientific data emerged.

All non-urgent England operations to be postponed,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled an ""unprecedented"" set of financial measures to support the UK economy through the coronavirus pandemic. They include mortgage ""holidays"" for those in financial difficulty as well as Â£330bn in loans and Â£20bn in other aid to protect businesses facing losses as a result of the virus. Meanwhile all non-urgent operations in England and Scotland will be postponed to free up beds for virus patients. It comes as the UK death toll hit 71. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. ""Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one,"" Mr Sunak said at a Downing Street press conference, as hedetailed measures to ease financial burdenscaused by the virus. The chancellor said the Â£330bn in loans - equivalent to 15% of GDP - would be available from next week to help businesses pay for supplies, rent and salaries. Other measures to be put in place include extended business rates relief and a three-month mortgage holiday for people in financial difficulty as a result of the virus. ""We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the same conference. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said there was nothing in the statement to protect renters - although Mr Sunak said measures would be announced in the ""coming days"". Mr McDonnell also called for statutory sick pay to be increased and for those losing their jobs to be given some support. And unions raised concern that no measures were announced to help freelancers and people working in the so-called gig economy, This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We must act like any wartime government"" NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said postponing routine surgery from 15 April would help to expand critical care capacity to the maximum - to prepare for ""the likely influx of more coronavirus patients"". The emergency policy to free up 30,000 beds will be in place for at least three months, he said. However, cancer operations will continue to go ahead, Sir Simon added. Sir Simon said the health system in England has about 7,000 ventilators and there are plans to increase this to 12,000. British engineering firmshave been called on to switch to making medical ventilatorsto help efforts to cope with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. The government set outemergency legislation,externalbefore MPs in the Commons to tackle the outbreak, including measures giving powers to police and immigration officers to detain people and put them in isolation to protect public health. In another day of fast-changing developments across the globe: The Foreign Office advised British nationals to avoid all non-essential foreign travel for at least 30 days TheEuropean Union will seal its bordersfor 30 days The number of deaths in Italy has passed 2,000 and the total in Spain has reached nearly 500 US primary elections have been thrown into uncertaintyas polling stations closed The Euro 2020 tournamenthas been postponeduntil 2021 An International Olympic Committee member says plans for the Tokyo games to go ahead are""insensitive and irresponsible"" Allhorse racing in Great Britain will be suspendedfrom Wednesday until the end of April In tennis, the French Open has been postponed until September All McDonalds restaurants in the UK and Ireland will become takeaways, drive-through and delivery operations Follow live updates here Meanwhile Sir Patrick said that, despite the upcoming Mother's Day celebration, the over-70s should avoid having Sunday lunch with their families. He also advised people taking painkillers to use paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, after French health officials indicated anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the virus - a suggestion Sir Patrick said ""may or may not be right"". Coronavirus and ibuprofen: Fact vs fiction BBC news online health editor Michelle Roberts said up to 15,000 of England's 100,000 hospital beds could be freed up for coronavirus admissions by discharging other patients who are well enough to go home or be cared for in the community. She added that Sir Simon would not say whether the measures will ultimately be enough to ease the pressure on the NHS. Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said emergency measures by the NHS in Scotland would also include doubling the number of intensive care beds. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK has reached 71,after a second death was confirmed in Scotland, as well asa second in Wales.and a further 14 in England. Some 1,950 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK,according to the latest Department of Health figures,external- but the actual number of cases could be as high as 55,000. Sir Patrick told the health select committee that a death rate of one fatality for every 1,000 cases was a ""reasonable ballpark"" figure, based on scientific modelling. More than 50,000 people have been tested for the virus in the UK, but the government is primarily testing people who are in hospital. This means many people who have mild symptoms may never be diagnosed with the virus. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""I have taken the decision to advise British national against international travel, globally"" Earlier the Foreign Office advised British nationals to avoid all non-essential foreign travel. The restrictions will be in place for 30 days initially but could be extended, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons. It is the first time the UK has advised against foreign travel anywhere in the world. ""UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries,"" Mr Raab said in a statement. ""The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak British people currently abroad do not have to immediately return to the UK - except for those in a few countries detailed inthe Foreign Office's travel advice,external. But the Foreign Office said travellers should bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice as foreign countries grapple with restrictions being imposed by their own authorities. The foreign secretary added the government would issue advice on how the flow of food and goods to the UK can be maintained, and that staff working on shipping routes should continue to do so as their travel was ""essential"". The travel advice for British nationals has in part been brought in because of the stringent social distancing measuresannounced by Boris Johnson on Monday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" Thekey new measures,externalthe prime minister announced included: Everyone should avoid gatherings with friends and family, as well as large gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres People should avoid non-essential travel and work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by gettingadvice on the NHS website,externalwhere possible By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" While schools will not be closed for the moment, a union leader has describedthe ""intolerable pressure"" teachers are underas a result of the lack of clarity about pupil and staff safety. Sir Patrick said closing schools remained an option to help curb the spread of the virus but would cause an ""enormous problem"" for the workforce. He told MPs such an intervention could have ""all sorts of complicated effects"" such as that children off school might have to be looked after by elderly grandparents.

Arena bomber's brother guilty of 22 murdersHashem Abedi is convicted of planning the suicide blast which left hundreds injured in May 2017.Manchester,"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi has been found guilty of murdering 22 people. Hashem Abedi had denied helping to plan the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which killed or injured ""nearly 1,000"". The Old Bailey heard the pair worked together to source materials used in the suicide blast after an Ariana Grande show at the venue. Prosecutors said Hashem was ""jointly responsible"" with his brother for the attack on 22 May 2017. The Manchester-born siblings ""stood shoulder to shoulder"" in the plot, with younger sibling Hashem ""just as guilty of murder"" as the bomber himself, the court heard. The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Hashem, 22, was also found guilty of one count of attempted murder, encompassing the remaining injured, and conspiring to cause explosions. He was not in court for the unanimous verdicts after hedismissed his legal team last weekand decided to take no further part in the trial. Top (left to right): Lisa Lees, Alison Howe, Georgina Callender, Kelly Brewster, John Atkinson, Jane Tweddle, Marcin Klis, Eilidh MacLeod - Middle (left to right): Angelika Klis, Courtney Boyle, Saffie Roussos, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Martyn Hett, Michelle Kiss, Philip Tron, Elaine McIver - Bottom (left to right): Wendy Fawell, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Allen-Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones Some of the victims' family members burst into tears as the verdicts were delivered after the seven-week trial. Figen Murray, mother of victim Martyn Hett, said while the verdicts bring her ""comfort to know the British justice system has played its role...it doesn't give us closure"". His father, Paul Hett, added that while ""this verdict will not bring back the 22 victims murdered by Salman and Hashem Abedi,"" he said it will provide ""an overwhelming sense of justice to all those affected by this heinous crime"". Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Twenty-two men, women and children, aged eight to 51, were killed in the attack while 264 ""were physically injured"" and 670 more have since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"". Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said the Abedi brothers had spent ""months"" planning the blast and had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". The bomb comprised a five-litre paint can placed inside a money tin, packed with thousands of nuts and screws They worked together to source chemicals and buy screws and nails to use as ""anti-personnel shrapnel"" in experimental improvised bombs, the court was told. The brothers used 11 mobile phones in five months - some for as little as two hours - and used a variety of vehicles, despite neither passing their driving test, to transport components around the city. Afterwards, police found Hashem's fingerprints at key addresses and in a car, which still contained traces of explosives. Although he was in Libya when the device was detonated he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, Mr Penny said. This video can not be played Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi Greater Manchester Police said Hashem may have been the senior figure in the plot, and intended to cause ""further bloodshed"" around the world. The former Manchester College electrical installation student held down a series of menial jobs working in restaurants and takeaways, including a Â£5-an-hour role as a delivery driver. He was described as ""unreliable"" and ""with the wrong idea of Islam"" by his boss, before he left for his parents' home country of Libya, 2,000 miles away, a month before the bombing. Hashem was detained a day after the attack, and claimed he was subjected to torture by Libyan militiamen before his extradition two years later. He told police he was ""relieved to be back in the UK"", adding: ""[I] wish to assist in this investigation as much as I can."" He then offered ""no comment"" during police interviews. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough said Hashem was ""with his brother throughout the entire process"" of making and building the bomb and that he had taken a four-minute phone call from Salman on the night the device went off. ""At that point he (Salman) is getting that last-minute inspiration (from Hashem)...and he's telling him what he's about to do,"" he said. ""I believe he provided encouragement right up to the end. This was all about the sick ideology of Islamic State and this desire for martyrdom."" He added: ""These two brothers are literally hand in glove in this process."" Salman Abedi was seen on CCTV arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying a rucksack Following the verdicts, lawyer Victoria Higgins - representing 11 of the bereaved families - said they were relieved that the ""calculating"" killer had finally been brought to justice. ""Families have waited a long time to see Hashem Abedi face justice for his crimes and I think the overwhelming emotion for most will be one of relief that he cannot hurt anyone else,"" she said. Sentencing will take place at a later date but the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said it was a ""little way off"". A public inquiry into the bombing is due to begin in June.

"Europe plans full border closure in virus battleThe European Commission's president is to urge leaders to ban ""non-essential"" travel to the bloc.Europe","France has ordered people to stay at home and only go out for essential duties The European Commission is planning to ban all non-essential travel to the European Union after more countries within the bloc closed their borders to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would ask leaders to implement the measures on Tuesday. ""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,"" she said. Meanwhile, tough new measures in France restricting movement from the home are coming into effect on Tuesday. The latest World Heath Organization (WHO) figures,externallist 173,000 infections globally and 7,000 deaths. A visual guide to the pandemic UK to unveil new financial measures to support economy They were alluded to in French President Emmanuel Macron 's televised address to his nation on Monday. He said that ""all trips between non-European countries and EU countries will be suspended"". Ms von der Leyen said that long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods. The measures would be in place for at least 30 days. Some 26 states are part of the Schengen agreement, which allows people to move freely between EU countries without border checks, but several countries have unilaterally closed borders in recent days in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, on the urging of Mr Macron. Citizens of non-Schengen EU member states will also be invited to apply the travel ban. Travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved. ""It is more effective and less disruptive than measures to close borders within Europe, which must be avoided to allow cross-border workers to continue their activity and essential goods to circulate in Europe,"" said Mr Macron.

It was watched by a record 35.3 million people, Le Monde reported, 96% of the people watching TV at the time. ""We are at war... we're fighting neither another army nor our own nation.

"Chancellor unveils Â£330bn in support for economyRishi Sunak announces 'unprecedented' help for companies as the economy goes through an ""economic emergency"".Business","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" The government has unveiled a package of financial measures to shore up the economy against the coronavirus impact. It includes Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial Â£330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"". He added: ""This a time to be bold, to have courage. We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses... We will do whatever it takes."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Sunak said: ""Some sectors are facing particularly acute challenges. In the coming days, my colleague the Secretary of State for Transport and I will discuss a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports."" The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was Â£330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP. And that is because the self-isolation and suppression moves announced yesterday will remove a chunk of our economy. At a stroke, every single forecast number in the Budget the chancellor gave less than a week ago are out of date. We are in an entirely new world. A wartime effort, with wartime deficits to cover it. It's not just there will be less tax and more income support required, which typically causes deficits to spike in recessions. Now we face the need for subsidy and provision of incomes in these very tough times. This is not a bailout. It's a very expensive bridge that the government cannot afford to fail to build. Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print. Like several sectors, the aviation industry has warned it is in a fight for survival as travel bans are put in place and travellers delays bookings. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, said Mr Sunak's measure were welcome, but added: ""Airlines are facing significant pressure and without government action there is a real risk to the industry. It will be important to work through the detail, but we are already talking to government."" This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak annouces a three-month mortgage holiday ""to help people get back on their feet"" Retailers, too, have warned the future looks grim without help. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

Laura Ashley nears collapse as firms demand help,"Fashion and furniture chain Laura Ashley has become the latest business casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. Just two weeks after regional airline Flybe collapsed, the retailer has said it will have to call in administrators, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It is one of the many firms reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, with the government advising people to avoid unnecessary contact with others. Its action comes as the chancellor prepares fresh support for companies. Firms from many industries including airlines, retailers, restaurants, theatres and pubs have said the virus has pushed them to the brink, with several warning of imminent collapse without government help. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already announced a Â£12bn Budget package to help businesses deal with the crisis, including business rates relief for small firm and a new hardship fund. But he said in his Budget speech he would ""not hesitate to act"" if more was needed, and he is expected to unveil new financial measures in the government's daily briefing on the outbreak on Tuesday afternoon. Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the CBI business lobby group, called for co-ordinated and fast action to support businesses. ""We do not want to look back and say we acted too late,"" she said. The bosses of sixty big High Street retailers including Top Shop owner Arcadia, Costa Coffee, JD Sports and Primark wrote to the government on Tuesday pushing for a suspension of business rates for large retailers. ""Turning specifically to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic: there is no doubt that it is already being widely felt amongst the members of this group, with footfall and turnover declining by up to 50% in many towns and shopping centres,"" the chief executives said. Earlier Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs that Britain was facing something akin to a wartime situation for its public finances. He added that now was not the time for the government to hold back on spending. Sectors which have warned of problems include: Nissan hassuspended production at its Sunderland car plant. The hospitality industry warned on Tuesday thatnew government restrictions around coronavirus could shut down firms. Cafe chain Carluccio'ssaid it could see closures ""in days"" due to the impact of the virus. Airlines have had tocancel thousands of flights and ground planesand airports have warned they may have to close down operations. The UK tourism industry is seeing a sharp drop in bookings amid travel restrictions across Europe and elsewhere. Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehousewill temporarily close their doors until further notice. Most sporting events have been suspended including Premier League football games, horse racing events, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Most businesses do not have insurance cover to compensate them for coronavirus losses, a trade body and other experts have said. Small businesses, in particular,are unlikely to have such a policy. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chairMike Cherry said: ""Many will feel like they are being made to choose between their health and the very survival of their business. Nobody should have to make this choice."" He added that the prospect for small businesses over the coming weeks ""is increasingly bleak"". However, some retailers are seeing a huge spike in demand, with Amazon workersabeing told to work overtime to tackle demand for goods. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Laura Ashley said the outbreak ""has had an immediate and significant impact on trading"". It had been in talks with its lenders about accessing more funds to continue trading. But based on cashflow forecasts and continued virus uncertainty, it said it would not get that money in time. The firm, which was also facing challenging High Street conditions, said: ""The Covid-19 outbreak has had an immediate and significant impact on trading, and ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation."" The outgoing head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has warned the Treasury Select Committee that some businesses will ""inevitably"" fail during the coronavirus outbreak. Far from his usual approach of urging fiscal restraint, Chote says a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible - saying it's better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). He highlighted that the government ran deficits of 20% of GDP for five years during the WW2 era (vs just under 2% of GDP last year), and said that was the right thing to do. He also urged help for those working in the gig economy. His words, coming hours before the chancellor is expected to outline more support, helped limit the fall in the FTSE 100 this morning.

"Chancellor unveils billions in support for economyRishi Sunak announces Â£330bn of help for companies as the economy goes through an ""economic emergency"".Business","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" The government has unveiled a package of financial measures to shore up the economy against the coronavirus impact. It includes Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial Â£330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"". He added: ""This a time to be bold, to have courage. We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses... We will do whatever it takes."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Sunak said: ""Some sectors are facing particularly acute challenges. In the coming days, my colleague the Secretary of State for Transport and I will discuss a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports."" The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was Â£330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP. And that is because the self-isolation and suppression moves announced yesterday will remove a chunk of our economy. At a stroke, every single forecast number in the Budget the chancellor gave less than a week ago are out of date. We are in an entirely new world. A wartime effort, with wartime deficits to cover it. It's not just there will be less tax and more income support required, which typically causes deficits to spike in recessions. Now we face the need for subsidy and provision of incomes in these very tough times. This is not a bailout. It's a very expensive bridge that the government cannot afford to fail to build. Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print. Like several sectors, the aviation industry has warned it is in a fight for survival as travel bans are put in place and travellers delays bookings. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, said Mr Sunak's measure were welcome, but added: ""Airlines are facing significant pressure and without government action there is a real risk to the industry. It will be important to work through the detail, but we are already talking to government."" This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak annouces a three-month mortgage holiday ""to help people get back on their feet"" Retailers, too, have warned the future looks grim without help. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said.

Amazon staff told to work overtime as virus hits,"Workers at Amazon's UK warehouses are being told to work overtime to tackle huge demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, despite government calls to restrict social contact. The GMB union says that workers across at least four different sites were informed that they had to work ""compulsory overtime"" from Monday. National officer Mick Rix said Amazon had put ""profit before safety"". Amazon said it was working to ensure it can continue to deliver to customers. Compulsory overtime means that some employees must work additional hours,externalas requested by an employer - if their contract says so. Amazon employs 27,000 people in the UK and has 17 warehouses. One worker at Amazon's Dunfermline warehouse in Scotland, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that staff in the ""inbound goods"" department are having additional hours imposed. The worker, who thinks they have a compulsory overtime clause in their contract, believes this will be for at least two weeks. They said that there is extra pressure on the workforce to deal with an influx of goods the company is bringing in due to a spike in demand. Sought-after items include bleach, handwash, nappies, large boxes of rice and powdered milk. The worker added that these actions were ""very rare"" outside of the Christmas trading period or Amazon ""Prime week"", where the firm offers discounts on goods for subscribers. The worker said other departments in the Dunfermline warehouse are not saying staff should do more hours, but offering them up to 60 hours of voluntary overtime. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the company had ramped up shifts across the UK. They said: ""As demand continues to increase, we are working to ensure we can continue to deliver to the most-impacted customers while keeping our people safe"". ""Many of these customers have no other way to get essential items and we want to be sure that we have the right resources in place to deliver on their needs. Coronavirus: Stocks rocked by record volatility US airlines used up spare cash buying back shares Coronavirus: What are your rights if working from home? ""Starting this week, we'll be prioritising the intake and dispatch of items most needed by our customers right now. These are items such as food, health and personal care products, items needed to work from home, books and toys for children."" Amazon also said that there is an exemptions process in place for employees who cannot work additional hours for personal reasons, such as caring responsibilities. On Monday, Boris Johnson said peopleshould work from home where possibleas part of a range of stringent new measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. The GMB union's national officer Mick Rix called the overtime reports ""extremely concerning"", and accused Amazon of ""imposing its demands on workers without any regard for their safety"". Mr Rix said he was concerned that if staff are overworked, stress will make them more susceptible to the Covid-19 virus. Sarah Evans, employment law partner at JMW solicitors, said that if a worker's contract has a clause in it that says there ""may be an element of compulsory overtime"", then a boss is entitled to use it to make them do additional hours. Amazon has seen a spike in demand for health and personal care products amid the coronavirus pandemic She pointed out that under Working Time Regulations in the UK, overtime is limited to a maximum of 48 hours per week, averaged over a 17-week period. Workers can ""opt out"" of the maximum weekly limit, however, and some are required to do so as a condition of employment. Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at Stevens & Bolton, said that these were ""unprecedented times, but all employers must operate within the law."" She added: ""All employers also owe an implied duty to take reasonable care for the health and safety of its employees... this extends to mental health as well as physical health."" Workers in the US have also been posting on social media about working overtime at Amazon fulfilment centres. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Breaking bad: The oil industry's dirty secret," Uncovering The OilIndustry's Dirty Secret By Chris Foote Workers run away as part of a ship falls as it is being dismantled in an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Workers run away as part of a ship falls as it is being dismantled in an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Alang is a graveyard for ships. Its coastline was once filled with fishing boats — but today the rusting hulks of oil tankers and ocean liners stretch for miles along the shores of this town in north west India. The premium prices paid for steel make it a lucrative place to dismantle ships. Alang’s high tides and sloping coastline also create the ideal natural conditions for the work. Its shipbreaking yards are the busiest in the world  and oil companies are among their biggest customers. About a third of all vessels which are sold for scrap will end their days there. But it comes at a cost to men like Javesh and Naveen, who work in the searing heat and pollution of the yards. “We do not have human rights,” said Naveen. “Sometimes we feel like we’re animals. We’re treated like insects by these people.” Javesh and Naveen agreed to speak to Mark Daly from the BBC's Disclosure team on condition of anonymity. We have changed their names to protect them and their families. Workers in the yards dismantle ships by hand with blowtorches and sledgehammers so the valuable metals they contain can be salvaged. Little goes to waste. Steel and wood are recycled at workshops which surround the shipyards and everything else finds its way to open-air markets in Alang where you can buy boxes of lightbulbs from oil tankers or cutlery from cruise ships. Like most of the workforce, Javesh and Naveen are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, one of the poorest parts of India. They live on the outskirts of the yards in shanties without running water, toilets or electricity. “We buy scrap wood which comes out of ships and we build these places ourselves,” said Javesh. “The company doesn’t take responsibility for the labourers at all. ""All they care about is the work.” Shipbreaking is dangerous and dirty work and men like Javesh and Naveen are in constant danger, according to Ingvild Jenssen. She is the founder and director of Shipbreaking Platform, an organisation which monitors the industry. “They risk gas explosions, falling from heights, being crushed by massive steel plates that fall down — those are the main causes of the fatal accidents,” she explained. Workers often lack basic safety gear and at least 137 lost their lives between 2009 and 2019, according to Shipbreaking Platform. The organisation believes that number is probably only the tip of the iceberg because shipyard owners refuse to discuss accidents. More than half of shipyard workers say they have been injured on the job,according to a survey last year by the Tata Institute in Mumbai. During their interview, Javesh and Naveen showed our team numerous scars and burns on their legs and arms. There is only one small clinic in Alang and more seriously injured workers have to travel to the city hospital in Bhavnagar – a 30-mile journey on unpaved roads which takes more than an hour. Workers are also at risk from hazardous waste like asbestos and mercury contained in many of the vessels sold to the scrapyards. “Many more workers succumb to occupational diseases and cancers years after they’ve worked at the yards because they are exposed on a daily basis to toxic fumes [and] materials at the yards,” Ms Jenssen added.

They send whatever money they can home to their families, who they may not see for months. “If we get scared, our families would starve,” said Naveen. “This is what it comes down to - the labourers have to do the work... safety or no safety.” Workers dismantle a ship in an Alang yard (Reuters, 2018) Workers dismantle a ship in an Alang yard (Reuters, 2018) Despite the conditions in the shipyards, workers are too afraid to speak out. “If we say anything we are thrown out of the company,” said Javesh. “If someone speaks they will be fired [so] no-one speaks. “We are not treated as humans should be. ""Basically we are helpless [and] because we are helpless we keep working.” The industry has also taken a toll on the environment in Alang. The way ships are dismantled makes it almost impossible to contain pollution. There are no docks or harbours — instead ships are beached and sit in the open water as they are cut apart, allowing waste to wash in and out with the tide.  Many yards use the “gravity method”, where chunks of metal are allowed to fall onto the beach as they are cut away. Oil rigs are more difficult to beach so they are dumped on tidal flats up to a mile and a half away, where pieces are cut from them until they are light enough to be dragged ashore to finish the work. It usually only takes a few weeks for a vessel to disappear, although the largest of them, like the Schiehallion — an 86,000 tonne floating factory from the North Sea which was dumped in Alang in 2017 — can take more than a year to dismantle. Scientific studies have identifiedunsafe levels of poisonous heavy metalsin the waters around the town, including iron, mercury, copper, zinc and lead. Shipbreaking Platform describes the yards as “toxic hotspots”. Workers tie a rope to a decommissioned rig at an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Workers tie a rope to a decommissioned rig at an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) “When you have hundreds of vessels ramped up one beside the other... releasing toxic fumes, air pollution and heavy metals... into the sea, that pollutes the sea, the soil, and also the groundwater,” said Ms Jenssen. “So the environmental impact... is massive.” Fishing was once the most important business in Alang, but nets have grown empty since shipbreaking took over in the 1980s. “In the last 20 years the size of the catch has gone down,” said Dinesh Gulab Bivagar, a community leader from Ghogha, a small town a few miles north of the shipyards. “Before, our fisherman brought back full boats of fish. ""Now they don’t bring back as much, there aren’t as many fish in the sea.” He estimates the catch in Ghogha has fallen by 75% in the last two decades but he is wary of blaming shipbreaking. Few local people are prepared to be critical of an industry which is so vital to the economy in Alang. The fish that are left may not even be safe to eat — one study from 2010 found theycontained dangerously high concentrations of poisonous metals. And new tests show the impact of shipbreaking is not limited to the marine environment. Sediment samples collected by the BBC from one stretch of the breaking beach in Alang were analysed by experts at the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). They found the sediment was more than 50% metal - which they demonstrated by placing a magnet over one of the samples. Sammi Mallin, a scientist at Sepa, believes this is a result of the shipbreaking process. “When we looked at the metal content of the sample under high magnification, we were able to pick out little metal spheres,” she explained. “They’re produced when something like a high-temperature acetylene torch is used for cutting steel and they fuse to the gravel they land on. “We would not expect to find these in a natural environment.” The industry has also taken a toll on the environment in Alang.

Sammi Mallin, a scientist at Sepa, believes this is a result of the shipbreaking process. “When we looked at the metal content of the sample under high magnification, we were able to pick out little metal spheres,” she explained. “They’re produced when something like a high-temperature acetylene torch is used for cutting steel and they fuse to the gravel they land on. “We would not expect to find these in a natural environment.” Workers pull a rope tied to a decommissioned oil rig to dismantle it at an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Workers pull a rope tied to a decommissioned oil rig to dismantle it at an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Alang has a global reputation as a centre for shipbreaking, but it is illegal for companies in the UK, the United States and Europe to send ships there without removing hazardous waste from them first — a costly and time-consuming process. “Developing countries should not be the dumping ground of hazardous materials from the developed world,” says Ingvild Jenssen, from Shipbreaking Platform. “A vessel containing asbestos and other toxic materials should not be exported to India or Bangladesh or Pakistan for breaking, but recycled in a facility that can handle and properly dispose of these hazardous materials.” So how did 200 vessels - many formerly owned by European companies - end up in Alang last year? Oliver Holland is a lawyer at Leigh Day, a law firm which specialises in human rights cases. He says the answer is companies known as cash buyers who act as middle-men between ship owners and shipbreakers. “The cash buyer is simply an intermediary, and is there, we believe, to try and avoid liability. To put something between [the seller] and the beach,” said Mr Holland. He says this is a common system which is used across the South Asian ship recycling industry. Ship owners sell their vessels to cash buyers, who sell them on to scrapyards. “The cash buyer changes the name [and] the ... registered owner, which is usually a postbox company in the Caribbean or whatever other tax haven,” he explained. “They are literally just there as a sort of a loophole to get around any regulation ... or legal liability.” Cash buyers oftenchange the flags of the ships they purchase, which can make it difficult to enforce regulations saying where and how ships should be dismantled. “You can reflag a vessel [to change] the country of ownership and the flag that it flies, which is important because it determines … which laws it comes under,” explained Mr Holland. So-called “end-of-life” flags often belong to countries with lower taxes and fewer regulations, like The Comoros and St Kitts and Nevis. They are rarely seen on working ships, but about half of the vessels sold to scrapyards in South Asia last year began flying them before they were beached. Workers sort out scrap metal from a vessel in Alang (Reuters, 2018) Workers sort out scrap metal from a vessel in Alang (Reuters, 2018)  Global Marketing Systems (GMS) describes itself as the world’s largest cash buyer and has close ties to the shipbreaking industry. In 2017, it signed what it called the biggest deal in the history of offshore recycling when it bought five oil rigs from Diamond Offshore, a leading offshore drilling company with offices in the UK and the US. A short time later, two of the rigs — the Ocean Alliance and the Ocean Baroness — were sold to shipbreaking yards in Alang. They arrived there in late 2018 after a long journey from the Gulf of Mexico. Javesh and Naveen work for the Hariyana Group, which bought the Ocean Alliance. “From the very beginning, I have been working on the ship,” said Naveen. “That ship has not been cleaned of waste.” Hariyana calls itself a “green ship recycling company” and says it follows “the best industry practices”. Its website is filled with promotional images of workers wearing head-to-toe safety gear. But footage filmed at the shipyard tells a different story.  Workers can be seen cutting up a section of the Ocean Alliance wearing jeans and shirts. Most of them are wearing hard hats but none are masked. “I have difficulty breathing, I feel like I’m suffocating,” said Javesh. “The ships are very old; there’s paint [and] all sorts of waste accumulated there,"" added Naveen. “When we light the torch and begin to cut, different kinds of gasses rise which we can smell and we really find it awful. ""We want to avoid it but... we are helpless.” Javesh said workers at the Hariyana yard were not given masks to protect them from the fumes. “We buy a thin towel using our own money… and we wrap this scarf or towel around our mouths,” he explained. One photograph shows workers clambering up an anchor chain without climbing equipment. “[Shipyard owners] give safety,” added Naveen. “But they give it in a bit of paper, in a video — in reality we get nothing.” There is a facility in Alang for the disposal of hazardous waste. But watchdog organisations and the workers we spoke to say not all of it goes where it is supposed to. Naveen said “garbage” like leftover oil and clothing is often dumped in the sea or burned. The BBC had intended to ask the owners of the Hariyana shipyard about the conditions – but instead our team was detained by officers from the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), which controls the port in Alang.  Despite having visas from the Indian government giving them permission to film a story about the ship recycling industry, the officers insisted that they needed specific permission to film near the breaking yards. While the team were told they were not under arrest, roadblocks were set up and the officers demanded that they hand over their footage - which they refused to do. After initially being questioned for about four hours, the local police arrived and asked them to drive to a nearby station, where the questions continued. None of the officers explained on what legal grounds they had been detained, and the GMB did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. However, it was clear that journalists asking difficult questions about the shipbreaking industry were not welcome in Alang. The Cromarty Firth, near Inverness on the north coast of Scotland, is a world away from the heat and pollution of Alang. Its cold, clear water is home to dolphins and porpoises, and its rugged coastline is surrounded by mountains capped with snow for most of the year. But even there, the oil industry has made its mark. For 40 years, the Cromarty Firth has been used as a place to keep out-of-work oil rigs waiting to be scrapped or put back to sea. There are 11 rigs in the Firth today — and the Ocean Nomad, Ocean Vanguard and the Ocean Princess are among them. Diamond Offshore was paid $3.8m for the Ocean Nomad and Ocean Princess, but never disclosed how much it received for the other three vessels it sold to GMS in November 2017. After the purchase, GMS hired two Chinese heavy-lifting ships to carry the three rigs to their final destination. But just days before they were due to be removed from the Cromarty Firth, Sepa stepped in. It believed GMS intended to take the rigs to India in breach of laws banning the international shipment of hazardous waste. “Our preference is that waste stays in Scotland and gets dealt with,” said Terry A’Hearn, Sepa’s chief executive. “If it’s going to move somewhere else, we need to make sure that it’s going to the right place, where it can be handled properly. “We got some intelligence that wasn’t necessarily the case... so we stopped the rigs moving.” Documents filed by GMS show significant amounts of waste aboard all three vessels, including the poisonous heavy metals cadmium and mercury. The Ocean Princess alone contains an estimated 428 tonnes of waste, including about a tonne of asbestos. An inventory for the Ocean Vanguard lists PCB, a highly toxic chemical which was used as an electrical coolant and insulator until its production was banned worldwide. After being bought by GMS, the names of the rigs and their flags were changed. They were also transferred into the ownership of three postbox companies connected to legal firms in Caribbean tax havens. Two of those companies had already been involved in the sale of ships to scrapyards in Alang. Throughout its dealings with Sepa and the BBC, GMS denied it was the owner of any of the vessels it bought from Diamond Offshore - insisting it was only acting as an agent for other, unnamed companies. But in January 2018, Sepa issued a warrant ordering GMS to leave the rigs in the Firth until it could prove they would be disposed of correctly. Over the next few months, GMS repeatedly pressured Sepa to let it move the rigs from the Cromarty Firth, complaining that it was too expensive to keep them there. More than two years later, they still have not left. “We’re not here to interfere in people’s economic activities on a whim, [but] those rigs will stay there until we’re convinced they’re going to the right place,” added Mr A’Hearn. The BBC understands they are now owned by a postbox company registered in Liberia and that GMS intends to have them dismantled in Turkey, where there are a handful of EU-approved yards and conditions are generally better than in India. So could Diamond Offshore have done more to ensure their vessels were disposed of responsibly in the first place? Ingvild Jenssen, from Shipbreaking Platform, says yes. “Western shipping companies are earning millions of dollars… exploiting poor practices in South Asia. “I think Diamond Offshore is completely aware of where these platforms would be heading. “They sold them to one of the largest scrap dealers, well known to have close links to the beaching yards in South Asia. ""The price that Diamond Offshore got for these platforms is also a clear indicator of the scrap destination, because the higher the price, the more likely it will end up in South Asia.”  Mr A’Hearn, from Sepa, says Diamond has a legal duty to ensure that the rigs are recycled properly. “There’s what’s called a ‘general duty of care’ in these sorts of environmental laws, where anybody in a chain is supposed to make sure that they’re giving their material to someone who’s going to be doing the right thing with it,” he said. One of the largest vessels ever broken in India, the Schiehallion, also had links to the North Sea. It was named after the oil field where it worked for 15 years, processing millions of barrels of oil for BP every month. In 2014, BP sold the Schiehallion to a company called Bumi Armada on the understanding that it would be put back to work – but in 2017 it was sold again to a cash buyer. Eight months later, it was beached in Alang. BP said it had “carried out due diligence” before selling to Bumi Armada. “We also built specific provisions into the sale and purchase agreement which went beyond the market standard contract terms... covering the future of the vessel and imposing conditions which required that in the event [it] was to be scrapped or recycled, it would be done in accordance with best industry practice,” a spokesman added. A view of an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) A view of an Alang shipyard (Reuters, 2018) Bumi Armada told the BBC its deal with the cash buyer was “contingent on the vessel being scrapped in compliance with green regulations”. Diamond Offshore declined to be interviewed by the BBC. In a statement, the company said its sales contracts require “those that we contract with to comply with all applicable laws”, including in the “preparation, transport and recycling of rigs”. “The rigs ceased to be part of the Diamond fleet more than two years ago and we are therefore not in a position to comment on the current status or future plans for these rigs,” the statement added. Workers at a yard in Alang take a break (Reuters, 2018) Workers at a yard in Alang take a break (Reuters, 2018) The BBC also put a series of questions to GMS about the company and the shipbreaking industry’s practices. GMS declined to be interviewed and described the allegations as “sensationalist”. GMS denied it intended to flout international laws by removing the rigs from the Cromarty Firth. “The owners had obtained the relevant legal permissions, customs clearances and consents from the relevant local authorities,” it said. GMS also said it had not committed to scrapping the rigs before Sepa intervened, saying: “While the rigs were purchased at their residual (scrap) values... the owners were still evaluating various commercial options.” It said claims about poor conditions at the Hariyana shipyard were “false”. GMS added: “We… appreciate the opportunity to clear up any misconceptions and biased views often driven by well-funded, self-serving individuals and groups that are responsible for misrepresenting the true state of affairs. “GMS has historically and proudly played an active role in bringing about positive developments and changes.” The Hariyana Group did not respond to the BBC’s requests for comment. Dales Marine Services in Edinburgh Dales Marine Services in Edinburgh South Asia remains the most popular destination for ships at the end of their lives, but a growing number of shipyards in Europe are applying for EU accreditation to dismantle ships. This ensures that the work is carried out under strict conditions. A handful of Indian yards have also applied, although none have been approved. Michael Milne is managing director of Dales Marine Services in Edinburgh, which is one of the 41 EU-accredited yards. “[Ships and oil rigs] have to be decommissioned in an environmentally-friendly fashion, which is what we hope to do here,” he said. Dales aims to recycle up to 95% of the vessels it scraps and, like in Alang, most of the work is done by hand. But at Dales, cutters wear at least six separate pieces of safety gear, including fire-retardant overalls and breathing masks to protect against the toxic fumes released during the cutting process. Vessels are dismantled in a dry dock to prevent pollution escaping. “Health and safety is paramount for us,” Mr Milne added. “Everybody’s kitted out properly, everybody gets what they need... we want to do it in a proper fashion, let everybody go home safe at night.” While three of Diamond Offshore’s rigs did not reach India, hundreds of vessels like them are still being sold to shipyards in Alang every year.  Chris Pålsson is the head of Lloyd’s List Intelligence Consulting, a company which forecasts trends in the shipping business. He says the way the shipbreaking industry operates makes it difficult to hold companies accountable. ""This is the darker side of the industry, but there are parts of this business who don’t really care about anything but money,” he said. “Because the ship is moveable you can register it anywhere... and it’s sometimes very hard to find the ownership of ships if somebody tries hard to not be seen. It’s difficult to find a binding legal case if you can’t even find them.” But there are signs this may be changing. In 2018, a UK shipping company called Zodiac Maritime was sued on behalf of a worker who lost a leg dismantling a ship it used to own on a shipbreaking beach in Bangladesh. The law firm Leigh Day alleged that by selling to the cash buyer GMS, Zodiac was aware of the conditions under which its ship would be dismantled. The company denied any responsibility, but in 2018 it settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Oliver Holland, who brought the case, said: “It’s very significant we’re able to represent workers in these cases. ""It’s… one of the only avenues of legal liability for these companies. “We hope… it will ensure there is some legal liability for these companies and that the workers get some retribution for what’s happened to them.” New legislation may also make it more difficult for companies to avoid their responsibilities. In December, the Basel Amendment — a global ban on exporting hazardous waste to developing countries — became law. “Price is important but an increasing number of ship owners are putting a value against the image of the company as well,” Mr Palsson added. “They’re quite frightened of being connected to anything that is deemed unsustainable, so I think there’s a slow process of things changing for the better.” While living conditions for the workforce in Alang have changed little over the last decade, there have been some improvements at the yards. Work still begins in the tidal zone, but concrete-bottomed areas have been built at a number of yards for secondary cutting. The Hong Kong Convention, a basic set of rules and regulations for the ship recycling industry, was adopted in 2009 and more than half of the yards in Alang claim they are now compliant. It says they must put together a plan showing how each vessel will be recycled, and maintain a list of hazardous materials aboard. Shipyard worker Naveen had a final message for European companies deciding how to dispose of their vessels. “First you need to ensure that your ships are in a safe condition,” he said. “Ensure that they are not harming the labour and the local environment. ""Once you have made sure, only then should you send your ships here.” South Asia remains the most popular destination for ships at the end of their lives, but a growing number of shipyards in Europe are applying for EU accreditation to dismantle ships.

"Carphone store closures to cost 2,900 jobs","Carphone Warehouse is to close all its 531 standalone stores on 3 April, resulting in 2,900 redundancies. The firm says the move is not related to the coronavirus outbreak, but was because of the changing mobile market. The mobile phone retailer has shops inside 305 big PC World and Curry's stores and these will not be affected by the changes. Almost 40% of staff (1,800) affected by the closures are expected to take new roles in the business, the firm said. Group chief executive Alex Baldock said customers were increasingly buying online and from its big stores - which sell computers and TVs as well as mobiles - instead of its smaller, standalone mobile shops. ""They can't find all this in the small mobile-only stores that are one-twentieth of the size; they're visiting these less and these stores are losing more money as a result,"" he added. The company's standalone stores represent 8% of Dixons Carphone's total UK selling space. It says the move is ""an essential next step"" in turning around its mobile business as part of a strategy outlined in December 2018. The aim is to return this side of the business, which will lose Â£90m this year, to profitability. Dixons Carphone gets its sales figures the wrong way round Dixons Carphone shares plunge on mobile phone woes Currys PC World customers scammed via eBay Talking about the job losses, Mr Baldock added: ""I don't underestimate how upsetting this news will be for our colleagues, and we'll treat everyone with honesty, respect and care. ""But though this is by far the toughest decision we've had to make, it is necessary. We must follow our customers. They want help with all technology, all in one place, and this trend is only going to accelerate in a more connected 5G world."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he emphasised the decision was nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak. ""The coronavirus and uncertain outlook ahead has underlined the importance of acting decisively, but no, the driver here is what we're seeing from customers,"" he said. ""We have to take the difficult decisions to throw our weight behind the parts of the business that the customers are showing us they want... that's with the big stores and that's online."" Selling electrical gadgets on the High Street has been a tough game ever since internet retailers got into gear a decade ago. Tough competition from the likes of Amazon sparked the deal that created Dixons Carphone in the first place - the 2014 merger of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail. The plan was that the merged entity would have the financial muscle to make a decent fist of selling online, and save millions by rationalising the two companies' retail estates. That did happen, but the bricks and clicks plan was too ambitious. For Dixons Carphone, mobile retailing loses Â£90m a year, so further retrenchment was inevitable. There will be questions about the timing of the announcement - on a day when so many are distracted by the wider impact of the coronavirus, few will notice the news that 2,900 staff are to lose their jobs. Dixons Carphone, though, will point to the inevitability of the closures, given the continued losses, and the increasing share of the market being taken by internet players. The people who are losing their jobs face a desperate few months - few retailers were hiring, and now the coronavirus has put most other potential hirings on hold. Dixons Carphone added that it remained committed to mobile and said customers would receive the same expert service in its big stores as in the standalone shops. It added that it was launching a new mobile offer later in the year and everything would still be available online. Kester Mann, from market researchers CCS Insight. told the BBC: ""Carphone Warehouse has been caught in the unfortunate crosshairs of lengthening mobile phone replacement cycles and ongoing apathy on the UK High Street. ""It has been clear for some time that something had to give in its business. A greater focus on online sales is a logical move. ""With more than twice as many people expected to keep their current mobile phone for longer than their last one, footfall has declined and mobile phone retailing is tougher than ever. Carphone Warehouse had no option but to make some major changes.""

Coronavirus: Stock markets continue to slide,"Financial markets remain turbulent as a massive slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus takes hold across Europe and the US. In the US, shares rebounded about 6% after steep falls on Monday. London's FTSE 100 also jumped 2.7% after being down more than 1% earlier on Tuesday. Other major European markets made similar moves. It comes amid fresh promises of financial aid to helped bolster growth. In the US,President Donald Trump's administration said it was considering sending cheques to Americansas part of a $1tn stimulus package. The US Federal Reserve also said it would use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tn in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow ended 5.2% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq rose 6.23%. Meanwhile, in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£330bn in financial helpfor UK firms affected by the outbreak. The outgoing head of the Office For Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has said a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee he said it was better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would guarantee â¬300bn of loans, and pledged that no French company would be allowed to collapse. Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain have also all announced hundreds of billions of dollars in government relief. Live: Latest business reaction to coronavirus Vauxhall factories shut over coronavirus fears Airlines cancel most flights as coronavirus spreads The scale of the US response - from both the central bank and the government - has been the most aggressive, even if many details remain unknown, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The good news is they're talking about it now, which is more than I can say about the Japanese or the Europeans,"" he said. ""It's too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Asian shares continued to see volatile trading on with markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai swinging between losses and gains. The turbulence follows one of the worst days in history for US markets.The Dow Jones lost close to 13% and the S&P 500 fell almost 12%, marking the biggest one-day falls for both indexes since ""Black Monday"" in 1987. That followed the US Federal Reserve making another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting central banks around the world to ease policy in the biggest co-ordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. In the last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has racked up the five biggest one-day points falls in its 135-year history. In March alone the index has also seen its four biggest one-day points gains on record. Wall Street's so-called ""Fear Gauge"" has just topped the levels seen during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, surged by almost 43%, surpassing the level seen in 2008.

Spanish coronavirus deaths surge close to 500The latest figures come as the EU plans cross-border travel bans and France begins its lockdown.Europe,"The French-German border is allowing only goods and commuters to pass The EU is banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its borders amid the coronavirus crisis. The measure is expected to apply to 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. UK citizens will be unaffected. The ban came as deaths continued to soar in Italy and Spain, and France began a strict lockdown. Europe has been badly hit by the virus, which has killed 7,500 globally. More than 185,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile,the Euro 2020 football competition has been postponed by a year. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Free travel is a cherished principle within the European border-free Schengen area. But in recent days many countries have unilaterally imposed full or partial border shutdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, at the urging of French President Emmanuel Macron. A visual guide to the pandemic Britons urged to avoid non-essential travel abroad The measures were agreed in a video-summit between EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon and will now have to be implemented by member states. ""They said they will immediately do that,"" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference. ""This is good, so that we have a unanimous and united approach [where] the external borders are concerned."" The UK and the Republic of Ireland - which is part of the EU but not Schengen - will be invited to join the measure. It was also crucial that the EU ""unblocks the situation"" with regards to closed internal borders, Mrs Von der Leyen said, because ""too many people are stranded"".

Laura Ashley collapses as firms demand more help,"Fashion and furniture chain Laura Ashley has become the latest business casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. Just two weeks after regional airline Flybe collapsed, the retailer has said it will have to call in administrators, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It is one of the many firms reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, with the government advising people to avoid unnecessary contact with others. Its action comes as the chancellor prepares fresh support for companies. Firms from many industries including airlines, retailers, restaurants, theatres and pubs have said the virus has pushed them to the brink, with several warning of imminent collapse without government help. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already announced a Â£12bn Budget package to help businesses deal with the crisis, including business rates relief for small firm and a new hardship fund. But he said in his Budget speech he would ""not hesitate to act"" if more was needed, and he is expected to unveil new financial measures in the government's daily briefing on the outbreak on Tuesday afternoon. Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the CBI business lobby group, called for co-ordinated and fast action to support businesses. ""We do not want to look back and say we acted too late,"" she said. The bosses of sixty big High Street retailers including Top Shop owner Arcadia, Costa Coffee, JD Sports and Primark wrote to the government on Tuesday pushing for a suspension of business rates for large retailers. ""Turning specifically to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic: there is no doubt that it is already being widely felt amongst the members of this group, with footfall and turnover declining by up to 50% in many towns and shopping centres,"" the chief executives said. Earlier Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs that Britain was facing something akin to a wartime situation for its public finances. He added that now was not the time for the government to hold back on spending. Sectors which have warned of problems include: Nissan hassuspended production at its Sunderland car plant. The hospitality industry warned on Tuesday thatnew government restrictions around coronavirus could shut down firms. Cafe chain Carluccio'ssaid it could see closures ""in days"" due to the impact of the virus. Airlines have had tocancel thousands of flights and ground planesand airports have warned they may have to close down operations. The UK tourism industry is seeing a sharp drop in bookings amid travel restrictions across Europe and elsewhere. Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehousewill temporarily close their doors until further notice. Most sporting events have been suspended including Premier League football games, horse racing events, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Most businesses do not have insurance cover to compensate them for coronavirus losses, a trade body and other experts have said. Small businesses, in particular,are unlikely to have such a policy. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chairMike Cherry said: ""Many will feel like they are being made to choose between their health and the very survival of their business. Nobody should have to make this choice."" He added that the prospect for small businesses over the coming weeks ""is increasingly bleak"". However, some retailers are seeing a huge spike in demand, with Amazon workersabeing told to work overtime to tackle demand for goods.

The firm, which was also facing challenging High Street conditions, said: ""The Covid-19 outbreak has had an immediate and significant impact on trading, and ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation."" The outgoing head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has warned the Treasury Select Committee that some businesses will ""inevitably"" fail during the coronavirus outbreak. Far from his usual approach of urging fiscal restraint, Chote says a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible - saying it's better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). He highlighted that the government ran deficits of 20% of GDP for five years during the WW2 era (vs just under 2% of GDP last year), and said that was the right thing to do.

Most UK cinemas to shut after virus advice,"A sign in the window of a Vue cinema in Altrincham, Greater Manchester Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld, Vue and Picturehouse are shutting all their UK screens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move comes a day afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to avoid public venues. Cinema UK, which represents the industry, said,external""most UK cinema sites"" would close in the coming days following the government advice. Theatres in London's West End and around the UK have already closed, and many concerts have been called off. Odeon has more than 120 cinemas in the UK and Ireland, while Vue has 91, Cineworld has 100, and also runs 24 Picturehouse sites. The BFI's Southbank complex has also been shut. Even before the announcements, many film fans were staying away from cinemas, with UK and Ireland box office takings down 50% between Friday and Sunday compared with the previous weekend,according to Screen Daily,external. On top of that, cinemas that remain open might not have much to show. Many of the biggest new releases of the coming months, such as James Bond's No Time To Die and the new Fast and Furious film F9, have been put back in the schedules. With more people staying at home, some film studios have decided to bring forward the home streaming releases of their latest releases. On Monday, Universal Pictures said it would start making its movies available on home entertainment on the same day as the films' global theatrical releases, starting with the family animation Trolls World Tour next month. The company will also make films that are currently in cinemas available on demand, starting as early as this week. This would include such titles as The Invisible Man and Emma.

The Prime Minister was heavily criticised by the entertainment and nightlife industries on Monday, for advising people to stay away from theatres and cinemas while not forcing venues to close, which could have given them financial protection. Some independent venues, such as the Lonsdale Alhambra in Penrith, Cumbria,have decided to stay openfor now. Cinema UK said: ""The priority now is to ensure that thousands working in the sector are helped during an exceptionally challenging period for them, and that UK cinema venues are supported during what, for many, represents an unprecedented challenge to their existence."" Tate, V&A and Natural History Museum to close West End shuts down after PM's coronavirus advice Pop stars live-stream concerts to combat isolation An Odeon spokesperson said: ""In line with the latest government guidance on Covid-19, we are temporarily closing our cinemas. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and look forward to welcoming back guests as soon possible."" Cineworld Group chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""At Cineworld and Picturehouse we are committed to providing safe and healthy environments for our employees and guests and have therefore made the difficult decision to close our cinemas in UK and Ireland until further notice. ""We deeply value our cinema-loving customers and have no doubt we will be serving everyone again as soon as possible with a full slate of Hollywood blockbusters and the best of independent films and content.""

Child deaths 'not properly investigated'Great Ormond Street Hospital is accused of putting reputation above patient care.Health,"This video can not be played 'I feel like Great Ormond Street have taken her from me' Great Ormond Street Hospital failed to properly investigate child deaths, suggests evidence uncovered by the BBC. The source of one fatal infection was never examined and in another case GOSH concealed internal doubts over care. Amid claims GOSH put reputation above patient care, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged it to consider a possible ""profound cultural problem"". Responding, the central London hospital said it rejected all suggestions that it treated any child's death lightly. BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme has spoken to several families whose children were treated at the world-famous hospital. All said that while care at one point had been excellent, when things went wrong GOSH appeared to have little interest in fully understanding what had happened. Two-year-old Alice Hobbs died at the hospital in November 2018. She was prone to infection when she was admitted in September after a bone marrow transplant at the hospital early that year. Alice Hobbs had a bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2018 But the ward she was placed on was dirty, her mother Kerry told BBC News. ""There were hairs on the side, almost like somebody had plucked their eyebrows. There were toys that had obviously been used and left in the room, and there was dust on the side. It was just dirty."" While the hospital cleaned the room, Kerry argued that her daughter should be on an isolation ward. Great Ormond Street disagreed, but in late October, Alice was diagnosed with invasiveaspergillosis,external, a fungal infection which can be fatal for people with low immune systems. The hospital did not investigate where it had come from. ""I was very upset,"" said Kerry. ""I was just told: 'No, no, no... we don't know, we couldn't possibly tell you how long she's had it for.'"" GOSH said that as Alice's death was not unexpected given the infection, it decided not to launch aSerious Incident Investigation,external, a national framework which outlines how it should examine the case and requires the hospital to report the incident to health regulators and NHS England. We passed the details to Prof David Denning, who leads the UK's national aspergillosis centre. His conclusion was stark: ""I would say there's about a 70 - 80% chance that this was a hospital-acquired infection."" He said that if Alice's death had occurred at a hospital where he worked. he would have launched a Serious Incident Investigation. After Alice died, Kerry Hobbs discovered her daughter was one of six children to die at GOSH since 2016, of invasive aspergillosis. The hospital told us none of the cases was treated as a Serious Incident, while internal reviews of each death found no ""modifiable"" factors. The concerns over how Great Ormond Street is run are shared by staff. A staff survey, published last month, made grim reading for management. Of 11 headline measures, GOSH is below average on 10. Jeremy Hunt was Secretary of State for Health until 2018 On two aspects, including whether there is a safety culture, it received the lowest score of all trusts in its category, while on three other questions, including how bad bullying and harassment were, and how good the quality of care was, its own staff rated it as among the worst. ""If we want the NHS to offer the highest quality care in the world, then we have to change a blame culture and sometimes a bullying culture, for a learning and an improvement culture,"" the former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told File on 4. ""That staff survey would indicate they don't have that culture at Great Ormond Street. ""We know they deliver world-class care, it's an extraordinary institution. ""I hope that if they're going to preserve that, they will look at the profound cultural problems that the staff survey would appear to suggest is the case."" The hospital also faces allegations of covering up errors following the death of 14-year-old Amy Allan in 2018, after elective spinal surgery. Last year,the coroner found significant failings in her care by GOSH. Amy, from Dalry in North Ayrshire, had a number of heart problems Immediately after Amy's death, her parents raised numerous questions and complained to the hospital, which convened an internal meeting, chaired by Matthew Shaw, now its chief executive. The minutes, seen by the BBC, show that as in Alice's case, instead of dealing with Amy's case as a Serious Incident Investigation, it chose to deal with it as a complaint, a process not requiring any external scrutiny. Peter Walsh, head of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said GOSH clearly failed in its statutory duty to carry out the highest level of investigation. ""It shouldn't make an iota of difference if a family complain about an incident as to whether it's recorded as a serious incident, if it meets the criteria. They're not mutually exclusive."" Amy Allan's parents Ricky and Leigh Allan The complaint response did not acknowledge any major concerns about Amy's care, but the inquest process gave the family access to more than 3,000 documents and a rare insight into the hospital's complaint handling. Emails from two clinicians reveal concerns that Amy was not stable when her ventilation tube was removed, with one doctor writing: ""Do not send what you have written to parents as it is inaccurate and misleading."" The response did not hint at any of those disagreements - by then, however, it had gone through 18 rewrites. ""They knew what they were doing. They chose to take all that information out, that's what's unforgivable,"" said Richard Allan. ""They seem to be experts at covering up and protecting the GOSH reputation at all costs and it's staggering."" Chief executive Matthew Shaw told the BBC the hospital now accepts that it should have treated Amy's case as a serious incident. ""It was a decision made in good faith at that particular time and - in hindsight - I think we'd have wished that we'd have made a different one,"" Mr Shaw said. He also said the hospital ""as a learning organisation"" would be open to Prof Denning's input on the death of Alice Hobbs. In a further statement, the hospital said: ""We currently have the lowest complaint rate in the country. ""But we do not always get everything right.

Child deaths 'not properly investigated'Great Ormond Street Hospital is accused of putting reputation above patient care.,"This video can not be played 'I feel like Great Ormond Street have taken her from me' Great Ormond Street Hospital failed to properly investigate child deaths, suggests evidence uncovered by the BBC. The source of one fatal infection was never examined and in another case GOSH concealed internal doubts over care. Amid claims GOSH put reputation above patient care, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged it to consider a possible ""profound cultural problem"". Responding, the central London hospital said it rejected all suggestions that it treated any child's death lightly. BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme has spoken to several families whose children were treated at the world-famous hospital. All said that while care at one point had been excellent, when things went wrong GOSH appeared to have little interest in fully understanding what had happened. Two-year-old Alice Hobbs died at the hospital in November 2018. She was prone to infection when she was admitted in September after a bone marrow transplant at the hospital early that year. Alice Hobbs had a bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2018 But the ward she was placed on was dirty, her mother Kerry told BBC News. ""There were hairs on the side, almost like somebody had plucked their eyebrows. There were toys that had obviously been used and left in the room, and there was dust on the side. It was just dirty."" While the hospital cleaned the room, Kerry argued that her daughter should be on an isolation ward. Great Ormond Street disagreed, but in late October, Alice was diagnosed with invasiveaspergillosis,external, a fungal infection which can be fatal for people with low immune systems. The hospital did not investigate where it had come from. ""I was very upset,"" said Kerry. ""I was just told: 'No, no, no... we don't know, we couldn't possibly tell you how long she's had it for.'"" GOSH said that as Alice's death was not unexpected given the infection, it decided not to launch aSerious Incident Investigation,external, a national framework which outlines how it should examine the case and requires the hospital to report the incident to health regulators and NHS England. We passed the details to Prof David Denning, who leads the UK's national aspergillosis centre. His conclusion was stark: ""I would say there's about a 70 - 80% chance that this was a hospital-acquired infection."" He said that if Alice's death had occurred at a hospital where he worked. he would have launched a Serious Incident Investigation. After Alice died, Kerry Hobbs discovered her daughter was one of six children to die at GOSH since 2016, of invasive aspergillosis. The hospital told us none of the cases was treated as a Serious Incident, while internal reviews of each death found no ""modifiable"" factors. The concerns over how Great Ormond Street is run are shared by staff. A staff survey, published last month, made grim reading for management. Of 11 headline measures, GOSH is below average on 10. Jeremy Hunt was Secretary of State for Health until 2018 On two aspects, including whether there is a safety culture, it received the lowest score of all trusts in its category, while on three other questions, including how bad bullying and harassment were, and how good the quality of care was, its own staff rated it as among the worst. ""If we want the NHS to offer the highest quality care in the world, then we have to change a blame culture and sometimes a bullying culture, for a learning and an improvement culture,"" the former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told File on 4. ""That staff survey would indicate they don't have that culture at Great Ormond Street. ""We know they deliver world-class care, it's an extraordinary institution. ""I hope that if they're going to preserve that, they will look at the profound cultural problems that the staff survey would appear to suggest is the case."" The hospital also faces allegations of covering up errors following the death of 14-year-old Amy Allan in 2018, after elective spinal surgery.

Odeon and Cineworld shut UK cinemas,"A sign in the window of a Vue cinema in Altrincham, Greater Manchester Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld, Vue and Picturehouse are shutting all their UK screens amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move comes a day afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to avoid public venues. Cinema UK, which represents the industry, said,external""most UK cinema sites"" would close in the coming days following the government advice. Theatres in London's West End and around the UK have already closed, and many concerts have been called off. Odeon has more than 120 cinemas in the UK and Ireland, while Vue has 91, Cineworld has 100, and also runs 24 Picturehouse sites. The BFI's Southbank complex has also been shut. Even before the announcements, many film fans were staying away from cinemas, with UK and Ireland box office takings down 50% between Friday and Sunday compared with the previous weekend,according to Screen Daily,external. On top of that, cinemas that remain open might not have much to show. Many of the biggest new releases of the coming months, such as James Bond's No Time To Die and the new Fast and Furious film F9, have been put back in the schedules. With more people staying at home, some film studios have decided to bring forward the home streaming releases of their latest releases. On Monday, Universal Pictures said it would start making its movies available on home entertainment on the same day as the films' global theatrical releases, starting with the family animation Trolls World Tour next month. The company will also make films that are currently in cinemas available on demand, starting as early as this week. This would include such titles as The Invisible Man and Emma. The Invisible Man director and writer Leigh Whannell posted a message confirming the news on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Prime Minister was heavily criticised by the entertainment and nightlife industries on Monday, for advising people to stay away from theatres and cinemas while not forcing venues to close, which could have given them financial protection. Some independent venues, such as the Lonsdale Alhambra in Penrith, Cumbria,have decided to stay openfor now. Cinema UK said: ""The priority now is to ensure that thousands working in the sector are helped during an exceptionally challenging period for them, and that UK cinema venues are supported during what, for many, represents an unprecedented challenge to their existence."" Tate, V&A and Natural History Museum to close West End shuts down after PM's coronavirus advice Pop stars live-stream concerts to combat isolation An Odeon spokesperson said: ""In line with the latest government guidance on Covid-19, we are temporarily closing our cinemas. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and look forward to welcoming back guests as soon possible."" Cineworld Group chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""At Cineworld and Picturehouse we are committed to providing safe and healthy environments for our employees and guests and have therefore made the difficult decision to close our cinemas in UK and Ireland until further notice. ""We deeply value our cinema-loving customers and have no doubt we will be serving everyone again as soon as possible with a full slate of Hollywood blockbusters and the best of independent films and content.""

Thieves 'escaped in boat' after Van Dyck heist,"A Soldier On Horseback by Anthony Van Dyck was painted around 1616 Art burglars who stole a work by 17th Century master Anthony Van Dyck may have used a boat to escape after the heist, police have said. A Soldier On Horseback by the Flemish artist, a leading court painter under King Charles I, dates from around 1616. The work was among three stolen from the University of Oxford's Christ Church Picture Gallery on Saturday. Thames Valley Police said a boat could have been used ""to access and leave the site"". The thieves also made off with A Boy Drinking (c. 1580) by Annibale Carracci, and A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying a Plan (late 1640s) by Salvator Rosa. Annibale Carracci painted A Boy Drinking in the 1580s Det Insp James Mather said: ""This is just a hypothesis at this time, but we would like to hear from anyone who has had their boat stolen recently or has noticed any unusual activity around where their boats are docked. ""We are initially asking people with boats based on the River Cherwell or the River Thames near Oxford to get in touch if you have noticed any unusual activity. ""If you saw anything unusual on these rivers on Saturday night, we would also ask you to get in touch. ""Also, please make a report if you find any abandoned boats which have appeared since the early hours of Sunday morning."" A Christ Church College spokesman said staff had initially alerted police to the theft of the ""important cultural artefacts"", and the gallery would be closed until further notice.

'The rich are to blame for climate change',"The rich are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, a study by the University of Leeds of 86 countries claims. The wealthiest tenth of people consume about 20 times more energy overall than the bottom ten, wherever they live. The gulf is greatest in transport, where the top tenth gobble 187 times more fuel than the poorest tenth, the research says. Thatâs because people on the lowest incomes can rarely afford to drive. The researchers found that the richer people became, the more energy they typically use. And it was replicated across all countries. And they warn that, unless there's a significant policy change, household energy consumption could double from 2011 levels by 2050. That's even if energy efficiency improves. Transport gulf The researchers combined European Union and World Bank data to calculate how different income groups spend their money. They say itâs the first study of its kind. It found that  in transport the richest tenth of consumers use more than half the energy. This reflects previous research showing that 15% of UK travellers take 70% of all flights. The ultra-rich fly by far furthest, while 57% of the UK population does not fly abroad at all. The study, published in Nature Energy, showed that energy for cooking and heating is more equitably consumed. But even then, the top 10% of consumers used roughly one third of the total, presumably reflecting the size of their homes. Solutions? Co-author Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the  project at Leeds, asked: âHow can we change the vastly unequal distribution of energy to provide a decent life for everyone while protecting the climate and ecosystems?â The authors say governments could reduce transport demand through better public transport, higher taxes on bigger vehicles and frequent flyer levies for people who take most holidays. They say another alternative is to electrify vehicles more quickly, although previous studies suggest even then demand for driving must be reduced in order to reduce the strain on resource use and electricity production and distribution. Rich Brits The research also examined the relative energy consumption of one nation against another. It shows that a fifth of UK citizens are in the top 5% of global energy consumers, along with 40% of German citizens, and Luxembourgâs entire population. Only 2% of Chinese people are in the top global 5% of users, and just 0.02% of people in India. Even the poorest fifth of Britons consumes over five times as much energy per person as the bottom billion in India. The study is likely to ignite future UN climate negotiations, where the issue of equity is always bitterly contentious. In the USA, libertarian politicians have typically portrayed climate change as a harbinger of global socialism. Normal lives? But Professor Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News: âThis study tells relatively wealthy people like us what we donât want to hear. âThe climate issue is framed by us high emitters â the politicians, business people, journalists, academics. When we say thereâs no appetite for higher taxes on flying, we mean WE donât want to fly less âThe same is true about our cars and the size our homes. We have convinced ourselves that our lives are normal, yet the numbers tell a very different story,â he said. The study says transport energy alone could increase 31% by 2050. âIf transport continues to rely on fossil fuels, this increase would be disastrous for the climate,â the report says. It suggests different remedies for different types of energy use. So, flying and driving big cars could face higher taxes, while energy from homes could be reduced by a housing retrofit. The authors note that the recent Budget declined to increase fuel duty and promised 4,000 miles of new roads. It did not mention home insulation. The Treasury was contacted to discuss the taxation issues raised in the research, but declined to comment.

The gulf is greatest in transport, where the top tenth gobble 187 times more fuel than the poorest tenth, the research says. Thatâs because people on the lowest incomes can rarely afford to drive. The researchers found that the richer people became, the more energy they typically use. And it was replicated across all countries. And they warn that, unless there's a significant policy change, household energy consumption could double from 2011 levels by 2050. That's even if energy efficiency improves. Transport gulf The researchers combined European Union and World Bank data to calculate how different income groups spend their money. They say itâs the first study of its kind. It found that  in transport the richest tenth of consumers use more than half the energy. This reflects previous research showing that 15% of UK travellers take 70% of all flights. The ultra-rich fly by far furthest, while 57% of the UK population does not fly abroad at all. The study, published in Nature Energy, showed that energy for cooking and heating is more equitably consumed. But even then, the top 10% of consumers used roughly one third of the total, presumably reflecting the size of their homes. Solutions? Co-author Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the  project at Leeds, asked: âHow can we change the vastly unequal distribution of energy to provide a decent life for everyone while protecting the climate and ecosystems?â The authors say governments could reduce transport demand through better public transport, higher taxes on bigger vehicles and frequent flyer levies for people who take most holidays. They say another alternative is to electrify vehicles more quickly, although previous studies suggest even then demand for driving must be reduced in order to reduce the strain on resource use and electricity production and distribution. Rich Brits The research also examined the relative energy consumption of one nation against another. It shows that a fifth of UK citizens are in the top 5% of global energy consumers, along with 40% of German citizens, and Luxembourgâs entire population. Only 2% of Chinese people are in the top global 5% of users, and just 0.02% of people in India. Even the poorest fifth of Britons consumes over five times as much energy per person as the bottom billion in India. The study is likely to ignite future UN climate negotiations, where the issue of equity is always bitterly contentious. In the USA, libertarian politicians have typically portrayed climate change as a harbinger of global socialism. Normal lives? But Professor Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News: âThis study tells relatively wealthy people like us what we donât want to hear. âThe climate issue is framed by us high emitters â the politicians, business people, journalists, academics. When we say thereâs no appetite for higher taxes on flying, we mean WE donât want to fly less âThe same is true about our cars and the size our homes. We have convinced ourselves that our lives are normal, yet the numbers tell a very different story,â he said. The study says transport energy alone could increase 31% by 2050. âIf transport continues to rely on fossil fuels, this increase would be disastrous for the climate,â the report says. It suggests different remedies for different types of energy use. So, flying and driving big cars could face higher taxes, while energy from homes could be reduced by a housing retrofit. The authors note that the recent Budget declined to increase fuel duty and promised 4,000 miles of new roads. It did not mention home insulation. The Treasury was contacted to discuss the taxation issues raised in the research, but declined to comment.

Coronavirus: What are your rights if working from home?,"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

"Avoid office, pubs and travel to stop virus - PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" The PM has said everyone in the UK should avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to curb coronavirus - as the country's death toll hit 55. Boris Johnson said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70 and those with certain health conditions should consider the advice ""particularly important"", he said. People in at-risk groups will be asked within days to stay home for 12 weeks. More than 1,500 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK - but the actual number of cases is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. Thekey new government measures,externalare: Everyone should avoid gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres Everyone should work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by getting advice onthe NHS website,externalwhere possible By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" The UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy - the worst-hit country in Europe If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" Schools will not be closed for the moment Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said the group of people who should take ""particular care to minimise their social contact"" were: People over the age of 70 Other adults who would normally be advised to have the flu vaccine (such as those with chronic diseases) Pregnant women Mr Johnson said ""drastic action"" was needed as the UK approaches ""the fast growth part of the upward curve"" in the number of cases.He told Londoners to pay special attentionto the advice as the virus is spreading more rapidly in the capital than elsewhere. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the number of people to have died with the virus in England had risen to 53 - and ""the disease is now accelerating"". Thefirst death in Wales, and a death in Scotland, brings the total number of deaths in the UK to 55. The UK's plan has shifted because the scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care units. The modelling by Imperial College London,externalhas been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing decisions at the heart of government. Its calculations predicted 260,000 deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. ""We are in a war against an invisible killer,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that emergency legislation to tackle the virus would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday. Somelegislation will pass through the Commons unopposedthis week as MPs feel the pressure to tackle coronavirus. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said further measures such as closing schools may be necessary at some point. ""Those things need to be done at the right time,"" he said. The total number of people in the UK to test positive for the virus has risen by 171 in a day to a total of 1,543, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. The latest cases include 30 more from Wales and18 in Scotland. Sir Patrick said the UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy. Italy, the worst-affected nation outside China - where the virus originated - has more than 20,000 cases and has suffered more than 1,800 deaths. Sir Patrick added: ""It looks like we're on the fast upswing or just about to get there and that's the reason to want to get in quite quickly with these measures."" This video can not be played Prof Whitty: ""People who do this...are doing things to protect the NHS."" However, Prof Whitty added that the chance of dying with the virus ""for any individual person"" was ""very low"". Most of those who have died in the UK have been people over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. What are social distancing and self-isolation? GPs prepare for NHS' 'biggest crisis' How to protect your mental health The acts of kindness sparked by coronavirus Prof Whitty said if one person in any household starts to display symptoms, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days. Mr Johnson said the stay at home advice means people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"". He said people could leave home to do exercise but should do so at a safe distance from others. Prof Whitty said social restrictions would be ""very difficult for people to maintain"" but they would be ""doing it to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed"". All non-essential public access to the Houses of Parliament will be stopped in response to the virus. Commons Speaker Sir Hoyle urged MPs and peers to heed the latest advice. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government's communication strategy and lack of support for low wage citizens. He said, despite being 70, he would not follow any advice to self-isolate. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Theatres and music venues around the UK,including the National Theatre, London Palladium and Royal Opera House, have announced they are to close from Monday night until further notice after the prime minister said people should avoid such locations. Ticket-holders will be contacted about obtaining refunds but as many venues are charitable enterprises, people are being encouraged to donate the cost to show their support. The British Beer and Pub Association said coronavirus was having a ""devastating"" effect on pubs. ""The government needs to give clear instructions and detail on the support package to rescue the sector and hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" chief executive Emma McClarkin said. Many have expressed anger that Mr Johnson advised people to stay away from ""pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues"" while not forcing premises to close, which could have given them financial protection. Actor Idris Elbaconfirmed on Twitter,externalhe had tested positive for the virus. And furthersporting events have been suspended,including Football's National League and Rugby Union's premiership, while events such as theGrand National,Boat Race and Isle of Mann TT races have been cancelled. Mr Johnson said the risk of transmission of the disease at sporting events was relatively low, ""but obviously, logically, as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it's right that we should extend that advice to mass gatherings as well"". Meanwhile, head teacher leaders have warned that keeping schools open as growing numbers of staff have to self-isolateis the most pressing challenge they face.The government policy remains schools should stay open although closures may be necessary ""at the right stage"" of the outbreak. The prime minister said the economy would take a short-term hit from the pandemic, but should come ""roaring back"" as the disease declines. Butglobal stock markets sank againon Monday despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the virus. More than 44,000 people in the UK have been tested for the virus. People self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested -the government has said,externaltests are primarily being given to hospital patients with respiratory problems, and to people in residential or care facilities experiencing outbreaks. But on Monday the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said not enough tests were being carried out. ""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,"" he said - adding that the WHO has sent out almost 1.5 million tests to 120 countries. Prof Whitty defended the UK's testing regime but said: ""We do intend to continue to scale up testing."" He said tests only reveal whether or not people are currently sick - and that a test to show whether or not people had previously had the virus would be ""transformational"". Public Health England (PHE) was ""very rapidly"" developing such a test, he added. The lockdown of European countries has continued to expand -Germany and Franceare the latest to enforce stringent measures The European Union will close its borders for 30 days from Tuesday to external visitors from non-EU countries, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. But travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved A virus-hit cruise ship stranded in the Bahamas has set sail for Cuba, where 667 British passengers will be flown back to the UK Travel restrictions and a slump in demand due to the virus haveforced airlines to cancel most flightsand temporarily reduce staff In the US, President Trump said people should avoid meeting in groups of more than 10, but that a nationwide quarantine is not yet planned What the virus does to the body Industry urged to help make ventilators First virus death in Wales Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

UK to unveil new coronavirus financial measures,"A London tube station after people were advised to work from home Britons and UK businesses are feeling the impact of unprecedented coronavirus measures, as the chancellor prepares to unveil plans to help the economy. RetailerLaura Ashley filed for administrationas venues across the UK closed their doors, and airports warned they could shut down ""within weeks"". It comes after the government outlined new adviceto avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others. And watchdog the OBR told MPs some businesses will 'inevitably' fail. The head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote said Britain was facing something akin to a wartime situation for its public finances and a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. On Monday, the Prime Minister said people should work from home where possible, and stay away from pubs and restaurants. People in at-risk groups will be asked within days to stay home for 12 weeks. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK has reached 55. More than 1,500 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK - but the actual number of cases is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. The UK's shift in strategy comes asEurope plans to ban all non-essential travelthroughout the Schengen free-travel zone, as more countries close their borders. LATEST:Follow live updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic In Boris Johnson's first daily update on Monday he acknowledged the economy was facing ""a severe blow"" because of the virus. Thekey new measures,externalhe announced included: Everyone should avoid gatherings with friends and family, as well as large gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres People should avoid non-essential travel and work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by getting advice on the NHS website where possible By the weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" Schools will not be closed for the moment This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" Under the guidance, people who should be ""particularly stringent"" in minimising their social contact are: People over the age of 70 Other adults who would normally be advised to have the flu vaccine (such as those with chronic diseases) Pregnant women The UK's plan has shifted because the scientific modelling showed we were on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". A strategy of just slowing the spread of the virus, but not trying to stop it, would have overwhelmed intensive care units. The modelling by Imperial College London,externalhas been heavily informed by the experience in Italy and is influencing decisions at the heart of government. Its calculations predicted 260,000 deaths in the UK. Instead the plan is to drive down the number of cases to very low levels, which the models predict will limit deaths from coronavirus to the thousands or tens of thousands. However, this approach comes with a major problem - there is no exit strategy. Without the immunity that would build up if people were infected, then cases would soar as soon as measures are lifted. The report said these could need to be in place until a vaccine is available, which could take up to 18 months. We are in this for the long haul. Read more from James The expected economic announcement comes less than a week after new Chancellor Rishi Sunak published his Budget, which includedÂ£12bn specifically targeted at coronavirus measuresto get the country through the outbreak. Mr Sunak is also expected to appear at the now daily Downing Street news conference later. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Â£12bn announced in last week's Budget now looked potentially ""completely inadequate"" in the light of the way the crisis had developed. However, she said she would be surprised to hear pledges similar to those on the drastic scale made by French President Macron, who promised hundreds of billions of euros on Monday. Help for the airline industry,which has been crippled by travel bans and a collapse in demand, is expected to be among the new measures, according to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason. Pubs, theatres and music venues have expressed angerabout the impact of the government's new guidance on their businesses. Many have been critical that the prime minister advised people to stay away from social venues while not forcing premises to close, which could have given them financial protection. Theatres and music venues around the UK, including the National Theatre, London Palladium and Royal Opera House, have announced they are to close from Monday night until further notice. Other businesses affected: Fashion and home retailer Laura Ashley said it would appoint administrators and its shares would be suspended Carluccio's said the restaurant chain ""was days away from large-scale closures"" Cinema chains Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehouse will temporarily close their doors until further notice The Tate's museums will shut until 1 May The National Trust said it will close its houses, shops and cafes by Friday, but gardens and parks would remain open Meanwhile, teachers' union NASUWT said a lack of advice for schools was causing a ""rising sense of panic"", adding that a ""definitive decision"" was needed on how to protect staff and pupils. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains the UK's latest coronavirus measures A World Health Organisation special envoy, Dr David Nabarro, welcomed the government's decision to shift strategy and advise greater social distancing to tackle the pandemic. But he said further testing was needed to ""understand much more precisely how the outbreak is advancing"". He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would like to stress that in every other country positions are having to be shifted as we know more about the outbreak."" England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said there were ""significant moves afoot"" to increase testing for the virus by the NHS. But he added that ""for now"" it was going to be focused on where it would ""help us most"", such as patients in intensive care. Meanwhile,some legislation will pass through the Commons unopposed this weekas MPs feel the pressure to tackle the virus. Emergency legislation on the outbreak, which will be introduced to Parliament on Thursday, and the government's Budget will get ""nodded through"", rather than opposition MPs calling for a vote. The cabinet and shadow cabinet are also due to meet. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn met the prime minister on Monday evening and demanded support for the self-employed and those who cannot get statutory sick pay. He described the government's communication strategy as ""worse than inadequate"", adding that they did not share the science and rationale behind their decisions with the public. Mr Corbyn - who is 70 - said he would not follow advice to self-isolate and would carry on his duties as normal. On Monday the total number of people in the UK to test positive for the virus rose by 171 in a day to a total of 1,543, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. The latest cases include30 more from Walesand18 in Scotland. Most of those who have died in the UK have been people over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. In Monday's briefing, Mr Johnson said the UK was approaching ""the fast growth part of the upward curve"" in the number of cases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said the UK is now ""three weeks"" behind Italy. Italy, the worst-affected nation outside China - where the virus originated - has more than 25,000 cases and has suffered more than 2,000 deaths. Do you work in the retail or service industry?

US stocks see worst fall since 1987 on virus fears,"Global stock markets have sunk again despite central banks around the world announcing a co-ordinated effort to ease the effects of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones index closed 12.9% down after President Donald Trump said the economy ""may be"" heading for recession. London's FTSE 100 ended 4% lower, and other major European markets saw similar slides. On Sunday, theUS Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zeroand launched a $700bn stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action announced alongside the eurozone, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. However, investors are worried that central banks now have few options left to combat the impact of the pandemic. The new governor of the Bank of England,Andrew Bailey, has pledged to take ""prompt action again""when necessary to stop the damage to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said that while central bankers were trying to calm the markets, ""in reality it is having the opposite effect"". ""The radical measures have sent out a very worrying message to dealers, and that is why they are blindly dumping stocks."" In New York, steep falls as markets opened triggered another automatic halt to trading, which is meant to curb panic selling. Before last week, such halts, known as circuit breakers, had not been used in more than two decades. But the sell-off continued after the 15-minute suspension, with the Dow losing nearly 3,000 points or 12.9%, its worst percentage drop since 1987. The wider S&P 500 dropped 11.9%, while Nasdaq dropped 12.3%. All three indexes are now down more than 25% from their highs. In London, firms in the travel sector saw big falls. Share in holiday firm Tui sank more than 27% after it said it would suspend the ""majority"" of its operations.  BA-owner IAG fell more than 25% after it said it would cut its flight capacity by at least 75% in April and May. The FTSE 250, which includes a number of well-known UK-focused companies, ended down about 7.8%. New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Airlines slash more flights as coronavirus hits PM urges industry to help make NHS ventilators All the main European share indexes fell sharply, though they later regained some ground. France's Cac 40 index fell more than 5.7% and Germany's Dax dropped more than 5.3%. Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite in China ended the day 3.3% lower. Oil prices, which have been shaken by a price war between exporters, fell again. Brent crude dropped by more than 10% to less than $32 a barrel while West Texas International crude fell more than 8% to less than $30 a barrel. Only a few weeks ago, the fear was that factories grinding to a halt in China's Hubei province could cause global growth to stumble briefly. Then it became clear that the economic pain was likely to be much more extensive. Now, with tourism and leisure activities grinding to a halt and supply chains threatened, a widespread recession may be more likely than not. In other words, economic growth going into reverse for two consecutive quarters, which would mean cash flow emergencies for some businesses, possible corporate failures and rising unemployment. The challenge for policymakers is to stop that downturn. Sunday's extravaganza by the Fed showed how central banks can go big. But interest rate cuts are of limited use; they won't tempt customers to go out and spend in Marseille or New York when the bars are closed, and flights cancelled. So the markets are looking to governments for more targeted support and bailout packages. But even that won't calm nerves altogether. As banks enact their own workplace contingencies, what traders really want is a sign that the virus caseload has peaked, and then that the financial convalescence is on track. On Sunday, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, cut its interest rates by 100 basis points to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would offer at least $700bn for support to the markets in the coming weeks. The move comes as local officials across the US shut schools, restaurants and bars, sports leagues cancel tournaments, and retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Nike, and Gap announce hundreds of temporary store closures. Speaking after the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said: ""The virus is having a profound effect."" But stock markets dived as investors worried that the world's biggest central banks may now have very little ammunition left to deal with the effects of the coronavirus if the global economic climate continues to worsen. ""They [the Fed] pulled out whatever weapons they had and my sense is I think it may help initially but I don't think it goes much further because this is still a developing issue. They used up basically all their ammunition and we're down to sticks and stones,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Slatestone Wealth. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Alongside the Fed, five other central banks - the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank - also announced measures to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay for US dollars, which has surged in recent weeks. Andrew Sentance - a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates - told the BBC's Today programme that banks were acting to ensure enough credit was flowing. ""There was some criticism around the financial crisis that central banks didn't move quickly enough,"" he said. ""I see this as a partly precautionary action for central banks to show that they are doing as much as possible to keep the wheels of the economy turning."" Mr Sentance added that any further cut to the base rate in the UK, to 0.10% for example, would be ""symbolic, because it wouldn't have that much impact on companies or individuals"". In other developments on Monday: Strains continued in other parts of the market typically seen as less risky, with gold prices down more than 5% at one point The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions Shares in Australia recorded their biggest daily percentage fall on record, as the benchmark ASX 200 index dropped 9.7% The Reserve Bank of Australia said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into the country's financial system New Zealand's central bank lowered interest rates by 75 basis points as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy.

But of course, people in every corner of the world are being affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. We're pausing our live coverage for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. Here are today's headlines: We leave you with this galleryshowing how the virus has emptied cities around the world. You can find all our coronavirus stories here. Restaurants in central London have emptied since new social distancing measures were advised on Monday Hotels, pubs and restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic are being hit hard by the pandemic as travel plummets and consumers shut down their social lives. Here's what workers in the industry are facing: Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent ""We're going big"" - that was how President Donald Trump characterised the stimulus plan being worked on by his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin. While a specific figure hasn't been mentioned openly, it's thought the plan could amount to $850bn - more than the bail-out of the banks after the financial crisis. According to Mr Mnuchin, the administration is already talking to Congress with a view to passing legislation very quickly. He said he wanted direct payments to those who'd lost their jobs, with cheques going out within the next two weeks - though there will clearly be some means testing involved. The Federal Reserve, America's central bank, is also preparing to underwrite up to a trillion dollars of liquidity in the credit markets as companies struggle to find short-term borrowing to fund payroll and loans. Read more about the plans here. The UK government has acknowledged it could temporarily nationalise transport companies in an attempt to help them through the coronavirus outbreak. Some companies have warned of possible collapse and during an exchange in the House of Commons, Labour called for the transport system to be brought back into public ownership during the crisis. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs a number of ideas were being looked at, adding: âWe will work in partnership with the transport industry to keep essential services running for the public and for those who need to get to work, those who have essential business."" He continued: ""It'll be hugely challenging and we will require a lot of different responses and mechanisms in order to get there, including on occasions organisations being run by the public sector, which [Labour has] already seen in the case of trains but for a completely different reason.""  Kevin Durant is one of four Brooklyn Nets players to test positive for the virus US star basketballer Kevin Durant and three of his Brooklyn Nets teammates - so far unnamed - have tested positive for Covid-19. The entire team was tested and the Nets paid for a private company to conduct the tests. The National Basketball Association says it will notify anyone known to have had recent contact with the players, including opponents. The leagueâs 2019-2020 season was indefinitely suspended last week because of the outbreak. âWeâre going to get through this,â said Durant - one of the leagueâs top scorers - after testing positive. âEveryone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine.â The coronavirus has infected more than 185,000 people
worldwide across 159 countries and territories, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The latest figures, from the WHO and elsewhere, show that the six countries with
the most confirmed cases and deaths are: In the UK the figures are 1,950 cases and 71 deaths. Bear in mind that the true figures globally are likely to be higher
than the WHOâs, as there is typically a lag in its reporting. Also many cases involving mild symptoms are not being tested in some countries, including the UK.  Let's dig a little deeper into this. The head of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said a German company could have a vaccine ready by the autumn. But how likely is this? And what needs to happen for us to get there? So far, researchers have developed vaccines and are starting to test them. There could be human trials by the end of the year if these tests go well. But, even if a vaccine is developed before 2021, there's still a major hurdle beyond that in the shape of firms being able to successfully mass-produce doses. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. You can read more about the work to produce a vaccine here. A French scientist works to produce a new vaccine The chancellor outlined his measures alongside Boris Johnson at a Downing Street news conference The financial measures for UK companies which have lost revenue due to coronavirus come  after similar packages were unveiled by both France and the US. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised grants, relief from business rates and government-backed loans worth more than Â£300bn. On Tuesday, France announced it would guarantee hundreds of billions of euros worth of loans, alongside a 45 billion euro package to help businesses and affected employees. In the US, the White House's plans could potentially amount to $850bn and would include money to keep airlines in business; loans for small companies; and direct payments to Americans who lose their jobs. But Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, told the BBC: âItâs too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you
can do is limit the pain.â BBC presenter Sarah Montague's makeshift home studio With millions of people now working from home, many will be turning their attention to their home office set-up. From the right chair, to desk, to the perfect lamp - there's certainly a lot to consider... Things get even more complicated when you're expected to be on air. But some BBC presenters are making sure the show goes on. Our colleague Sarah Montague, who presents the World at One on Radio 4, shared the above picture of her new home studio on her living room table. And there was even a special guest appearance from this budding presenter, Pickle: Sarah Montague's dog Pickle rehearses his lines Question from Caroline Barker Caroline also asks what would be the isolating procedure if one of the newborn parents showed coronavirus symptoms. BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts says: There is little evidence about the risks to newborn babies from this
virus and, understandably, it may be difficult to isolate entirely. It is
possible to care for your baby still and do things to cut your risk of passing
on an infection. Wash your hands before touching your baby and before feeding them.
At the moment there is
no evidence that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, so itâs felt that the
well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of
transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk. Try to avoid coughing or sneezing
on your baby and avoid as much contact as you can. The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists has more advice:https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/,external The coronavirus pandemic has plunged much of the worldâs everyday life into uncertainty. If you feel like worrying about the virus, or the constant news updates about its spread, is taking a toll on your mental health you canclick here for some useful tips. It includes advice on taking social media breaks and limiting the non-crucial news you consume.   In Turkey, 19 people have been detained for making ""âunfounded and provocativeâ posts on social media about the government's handling of the outbreak. The government has also identified 93 suspects who had written posts âtargeting officials and spreading panic and fearâ, the country's interior ministry said. Turkey has closed cafes, sports venues, and suspended mass prayers in mosques. The number of confirmed cases there is 47. Question from Tanya Lucid Tanya, from Kingston-upon-Thames, wants to know if she has coronavirus and has self-isolated for 14 days, is there a chance she could catch it again. BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts
says: Experts say most people should
develop immunity, at least in the short term, after they have recovered from
coronavirus which means they shouldnât catch it again soon. There is a chance
that some people will get it more than once though. Anyone who has symptoms â a
high temperature and/or a new and persistent cough â should self-isolate to
avoid spreading it to others. If you have a coronavirus question you want
the BBC to answer, get in touch: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The German company CureVac could have a vaccine ready âtowards fall (autumn)â, EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. Experts have said it will take at least a year to 18 months to get to that stage.  Russiaâs Orthodox Church has announced new rules to improve hygiene and curb the spread of coronavirus during church services in its Moscow diocese. Worshippers have been told to refrain from kissing the communion cup, but they can still kiss icons so long as they are rubbed with disinfectant between each use. Under the new rules, officials will have to wear disposable gloves while cutting consecrated bread, and single-use cups will be introduced for zapivka, a mixture of wine and water consumed after communion. The Church previously said it would not close any buildings or cancel proceedings. But in this latest announcement, it said it would temporarily suspend Sunday schools, parish meetings and club meetings. Russia has confirmed 114 cases of coronavirus nationwide, the majority of them in Moscow. Question from Hilary Derby, 75, Solihull  BBC Online health Editor Michelle Roberts
says: As long as you keep a good distance
away from other people - here in the UK it is fine to go outside and enjoy the fresh air. People
should keep exercising to stay fit and going for a walk counts. If you have a coronavirus question you want
the BBC to answer, get in touch:   EU member states have agreed to close the EU's borders to all non-essential travel for 30 days, the President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced after a meeting of the EU's 27 leaders. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Read more here. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent In making his announcement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak underlined these were the first steps. Obviously the Treasury had to get this package together very, very quickly and there are still a lot of things that need to be done - including getting money to the right people. It will be reassuring up to a point - Â£330bn is a massive intervention. But for individuals worrying about their own circumstances, there will still be questions. Both the chancellor and prime minister said it so many times, that they were willing to do ""whatever it takes"", and to ""act like a war time government"". And war time is what it feels like for people watching all of this. But despite the measures introduced yesterday, the PM concluded by making it very clear, they may have to go further quite soon. Hours after announcing a big package of measures to help businesses, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak was rebuked by the House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for announcing the measures in a live TV conference before briefing MPs. Sir Lindsay said these were ""difficult and sobering times"" for the country and he did not want ""to pick a fight"". But he reminded the chancellor that ministers ""have a duty to report first"" to Parliament. Mr Sunak apologised and said all future financial announcements would be made first to MPs.  Question from Robert Thomson Robert is training for the Hull Marathon in September. As he lives on the outskirts of a town, he wonders if it's okay to carry on training on country lanes.
