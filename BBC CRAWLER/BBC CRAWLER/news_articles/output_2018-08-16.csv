A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades,"A-level students have been awarded the highest proportion of As and A*s since 2012, amid changes toughening the exams in England. Some 26.4% of exams have been awarded these top grades this year - but the proportion gaining A* to C dropped to 78.4% from 79% last year. England's exams regulator has said the results show a steady national picture at a time of significant change. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their results. Overall, 97.6% of A-level entries were awarded A* to E grades. Examiners dismissed the rise in top grades as ""extremely marginal"", while Ofqual has underlined that results have remained steady. In 2012, 26.6% of exams were awarded As and A*s. And in 2017, 26.3% achieved these top grades. A-level results 2018: Experts answer your questions What's new about this year's A-levels? Clearing: ""It's not the end of the world"" Unconditional university offer 'gave me confidence' Welsh students see rise in top grades In England, A-levels have been moving away from coursework and returning to students being graded on final exams. However, a mix of old-style and new exams are being taken in Wales and Northern Ireland. Last year, students in England took new, more challenging exams in 13 subjects, with 11 more following this year. The remaining subjects are being refreshed over the next two years. Regulator Ofqual promised grade boundaries could be lowered, once papers were marked, if the new exams were tougher than expected. This video can not be played BBC Rewind: The highs, lows and... embarrassing mums A-levels have also been separated from AS-levels in England, leading to a significant decline in the numbers sitting the separate exam at the end of the first year. For the second year running, boys have outperformed girls at the top grades. Last year, this happened for the first time in 17 years, amid the move to the new-style exams. This year 26.6% of exam entries for boys were awarded an A or A*, compared with 26.2% of girls. This compares with 26.6% and 26.1% respectively last year. There has been a rise in the number of students taking Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. These subjects accounted for over a third of A-level entries, but are still favoured by boys. In Wales, there have been improvements in students' performance at the top grades, with 26.3% getting A* and A grades. It means Welsh results at the top end are now in line with the overall UK figure, after lagging behind for several years. The regulator Ofqual says that grade boundaries have remained ""relatively stable"". It has compared the first batch of 13 reformed A-levels in England, sat in 2017, with those taken this year. This shows that, for 124 papers, the A grade boundary decreased this year, while it increased for 118 papers and for 95 papers, stayed the same. There was a decrease in the marks needed for a grade E in 91 papers, an increase for 110 papers and in 136 papers, the boundary stayed the same. ""Overall, the grade boundaries for individual papers are relatively stable compared to last summer,"" Ofqual said. ""At both grades A and E, a similar number of grade boundaries have increased as have decreased. ""On average, the grade boundaries at grade A have changed by around a quarter of a raw mark, and the grade boundaries at grade E have changed by less than a quarter of a raw mark."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds congratulated everyone receiving their results. He said: ""It is the culmination of a lot of hard work and dedication - from both those receiving their marks and the teachers who've been supporting them every step of the way. ""They should rightly feel proud of their achievements."" But Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the sheer weight of the changes had placed an intolerable additional strain on staff and students. ""We have no doubt that this has affected the mental health and wellbeing of a proportion of young people and teachers,"" he said. He urged the government to pay heed and ensure any future changes were introduced in a more manageable and considered manner. Students celebrating their results include Caitlyn Palmer, Mohamed Dini Munye Abrar and Daniella Adeluwoye Student Daniella Adeluwoye, from London, said she was ""ecstatic"" after winning a place at the University of Cambridge - despite teachers advising her not to apply for the course after ""average"" GCSE results. Caitlyn Palmer, whose place at the University of York has been confirmed, said her teachers were ""so supportive"" when she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression during her A-levels, adding the stress placed on students is ""completely unfair"". 'I didn't know black people went to Cambridge' Ucas figures show 411,860 students have taken university places so far - down 1% on last year. But a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population have already been accepted. A dip in the number of 18-year-olds, due to a lower birth rate in 2000, means universities are looking to fill their places Even the more selective universities are offering places to students through clearing which is the process by which universities fill their unallocated course places. There has also been a rise in unconditional offers and other ways of attracting students, such as bursaries. Ucas said thatlast year about one in eight people accepted to full-time university courses got there through clearing,external. This year, 30,000 courses are available through the Ucas system. For students who took Btec qualifications, results were released on Wednesday. Btecs, which also count towards Ucas points, are specialist work-related qualifications, designed for young people interested in working in a particular sector or industry. And in Scotland, results for Highers and Advanced Highers were published last week. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes,with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the exact percentage figures relating to the proportion of exam entries by boys and girls awarded an A or A*.

Hunt: No-deal Brexit 'would be regret for generations',"The foreign secretary has been visiting Denmark, Latvia and Finland Jeremy Hunt has clarified his comments about a no-deal Brexit, saying Britain ""would survive and prosper"" - but it would be a ""big mistake for Europe"". On Thursday he told ITV News a ""messy"" no-deal Brexit ""would be a mistake we would regret for generations"". But he later tweeted that his words ""should not be misrepresented"" and the UK would only ""sign up to a deal that respects the referendum result"". Tory MP Nigel Evans said: ""We don't need any lectures from Remainers."" The backbencher, who campaigned for Brexit, told the BBC: ""He's got his own views. He voted remain. The prime minister needs to ensure, as she promised, that Brexiteers are in charge of our leaving the European Union."" Carney: No-deal Brexit risk 'high' What is the 'no deal' WTO option? What would no-deal Brexit mean for food and medicine? And fellow Conservative Brexiteer Conor Burns told the Telegraph: ""The thing that we want to avoid for 'generations to come' is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don't have a seat around the table"". It comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials, amid growing speculation about the possibility of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal in March 2019. Theresa May and ministers have been meeting EU counterparts over the summer On Friday, Danish finance minister Kristian Jensen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Theresa May's Brexit plan drawn up at Chequers was a ""realistic proposal for good negotiations"". But asked about comments by Latvia's foreign minister, that the chance of a no-deal Brexit was ""50-50"", he said: ""I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we've got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU."" Mr Hunt told ITV on Thursday that he believed the government's Chequers plan was the ""framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based"". But he said, although the UK must be ""prepared for all outcomes"", if the UK were to leave without a negotiated deal: ""It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we were to see a fissure, if we had a messy, ugly divorce. ""Inevitably that would change British attitudes towards Europe."" At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan On Friday,he tweeted,external: ""Important not to misrepresent my words. Britain would survive and prosper without a deal... but it would be a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long-term partnership with UK. We will only sign up to deal that respects referendum result."" Business Secretary Greg Clarke, who has been meeting counterparts in Austria and Finland, said on Thursday he was ""confident"" a ""mutually beneficial deal"" could be reached. This video can not be played ""People need assurances that leaving the EU without a negotiated agreement will not be the end of the world"" says David Jones But he said that if the European Commission did not ""respond positively and constructively"" to the UK's proposal, ""the disruption and impact on our continent's businesses, economies, and millions of hard-working families across the UK and EU will be significant and lasting"". The government has been touting its plans for Brexit agreed in July at Chequers - the prime minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire - to the EU and its leaders over the summer. But the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has appeared to rule out a key UK proposal - allowing the UK to collect EU customs duties on its behalf - in July. Meanwhile,Buzzfeed News is reporting,externalthat it has seen a list of 84 areas of British Life - from organic food production to travelling with pets - which would be affected, should the UK leave the EU without a negotiated withdrawal. The government is expected to publish a number of technical documents on the consequences of leaving with no deal in the coming weeks. Former Brexit minister David Jones told the BBC's World at One it was a ""great shame"" they had not been published earlier as ""people do need assurance that leaving the European Union without a negotiated agreement is not necessarily going to be the end of the world - in fact, far from it.""

Brexit talks resumed in Brussels this week between UK and EU officials, with the focus on the Irish border - a key sticking point - and future relations. A European Commission spokesman said: ""As this week's round is at technical level, there won't be a meeting between Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab.

Obituary: Aretha Franklin,"Aretha Franklin possessed one of the most distinctive and influential voices in the history of popular music. In a 50-year recording career she racked up 20 Top 10 albums, a dozen million-selling singles and earned no fewer than 18 Grammy awards. An artist of immense versatility, her powerful voice, trained in the gospel tradition, moved on to embrace jazz, soul and rhythm and blues. The influential Rolling Stone magazine rated her as the greatest singer of all time. Aretha Franklin in 1967, the year she released her album I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You Aretha Louise Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on 25 March 1942. She was the daughter of CL Franklin, a Baptist minister, and his wife Barbara, an accomplished gospel singer. By the time she was six, she and her family had moved to Detroit. There the young Franklin learned to play the piano and began singing in her father's church. Her father's serial infidelities finally saw the break-up of her parents' marriage. Her mother left the family home and moved to Buffalo, New York, where she died from a heart attack aged 34. Her father became a respected figure among Detroit's black community, and his church a centre for gospel music. The young Franklin came into contact with a number of musicians, including Smokey Robinson and Sam Cooke. Encouraged by her father she made her first recording, the album Songs of Faith, when she was just 14, by which time she had already given birth to her first son, Clarence. She had a second child, Edward, when she was 16, but was able to maintain her singing career when her grandmother offered to raise the two boys. By now her talent was reaching a wider audience. Producer Berry Gordy tried to sign the young Franklin to his new Motown record label, but her father turned down the offer. Sam Cooke tried to persuade her to sign with his label, RCA. But she had already been spotted by one of Columbia's talent scouts, and that was the label on which she first entered the R&B charts in 1960 with Today I Sing the Blues. Listen to Aretha Franklin tracks (BBC Music) While she had two further R&B hits with Columbia, she only managed to scrape into the mainstream US Top 40 once, with Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody. But Columbia failed to exploit the potential of her gospel voice, and their insistence that she record girl group-style pop, such as The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss), saw Franklin move over to Atlantic Records in 1966. Her first recording on the new label, I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You), proved to be her breakthrough, going to number one in the rhythm and blues charts and reaching number nine in the pop charts. Her second Atlantic single became her best known song. Originally written and recorded by Otis Redding, her gospel-tinged rendition of Respect went to number one in the US charts and reached number 10 in the UK. The song, on which she was backed by her sisters Carolyn and Erma, became an anthem for the feminist movement in the United States and won Franklin two Grammy awards. Aretha Franklin in 1967 Franklin also became an icon for the US civil rights movement. Now dubbed, ""Lady Soul"", she was presented with an award by Martin Luther King and became only the second African-American woman to appear on the cover of Time magazine. She had three more US Top 10 hits in 1967, including the Carole King/Gerry Goffin single (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. King later featured the song on her groundbreaking 1971 album Tapestry. At a recording session in New York in 1969 By this time her seven year-long marriage to her manager, Ted White, who had also co-written many of her songs, was breaking down and Franklin was experiencing difficulties in following up her early run of Atlantic hits. There were rumours she had begun drinking heavily and, in 1969, she was arrested for disorderly conduct. Meanwhile, her father had hosted a controversial conference for a black separatist group that ended in a violent confrontation with Detroit police. It left one officer dead and several other people wounded. While she continued to churn out hits, such as Don't Play That Song, Call Me, Bridge Over Troubled Water and Spanish Harlem, she was becoming increasingly disillusioned with Atlantic, who were grooming a new star, Roberta Flack, for stardom. Franklin won no fewer than 18 Grammy awards The 1978 album Diva, an ill-advised attempt to cash in on the craze for disco, was a commercial flop and became her last recording for Atlantic. A year later her father was shot during a burglary at his Detroit home, an event which left him in a coma until his death in 1984. Franklin's behaviour was giving cause for concern, and she had to cut down on her touring after developing a phobia of flying. Yet her appearance in 1980 film The Blues Brothers gave her career the lift it needed, and a recording contract with Arista that saw her return to the charts with the album Jump to It. Its title track became her first US Top 40 hit in six years. Aretha Franklin with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on the Blues Brothers set Follow-up album Who's Zoomin' Who?, a mixture of pop, rock and dance, became Franklin's first ever platinum-certified album. Released in 1985, it contained hit singles Freeway of Love, the title track and Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves, a Top 20 duet with the Eurythmics. Her next album, Aretha, continued to build on her success and included the hits Jimmy Lee and a version of Jumpin' Jack Flash, produced by and featuring Keith Richards, as well as her Grammy-winning duet with George Michael, I Knew You Were Waiting (for Me). Aretha Franklin with Whoopi Goldberg, who starred in the 1986 film Jumpin' Jack Flash But her career again hit a plateau. She made a return to gospel with the album One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which received much critical praise, and a Grammy award, but failed to trouble the charts. The follow-up, Through the Storm, also failed to make an impression, despite a duet with Elton John which did get into the singles charts. In 1987 Franklin became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, while in 1994 she received a Grammy award for lifetime achievement. But her career had stagnated. She continued to record, without great success, and reprised her role as the owner of a restaurant in the film Blues Brothers 2000, for which she recorded a new version of Respect. Franklin set up her own label, Aretha Records, in 2003, but failed to release any albums on it. This was despite her announcement in 2006 that new tracks had already been recorded for a project entitled A Woman Falling Out of Love. In 2009 she sang the American patriotic song My Country, 'Tis of Thee at the inauguration ceremony of newly-elected US president Barack Obama. Her hat, adorned with a huge bow, caused a considerable amount of press comment. Performing at Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009 Following an operation in 2011 she struggled with health issues and cancelled a number of concerts. But in 2013 she returned to live performances with a concert in Detroit which launched a major tour. Franklin's own philosophy probably sums up why, despite the ups and downs of her career, she became such an enduring talent. ""Being a singer is a natural gift. It means I'm using to the highest degree possible the gift that God gave me to use. I'm happy with that.""

The voice of civil rights,"Aretha Franklin holds a copy of her Soul 69 album in New York City Aretha Franklin grew up in 1950s Detroit, surrounded from childhood by the now-famous faces of the civil rights movement. Her songs would become their anthems. Her Baptist minister father was the organiser behind the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom - the largest-ever demonstration for civil rights in the US until the March on Washington later that year, when the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr made his ""I have a dream"" speech. King was a frequent guest in her father's home. At 16 years of age, Franklin went on tour with him, just after recording her first album. She would sing at King's funeral a decade later. King's daughter, Dr Bernice King,called Franklin,externala ""shining example"" of how to use the arts to support social change. ""As a daughter of the movement, she not only used her voice to entertain but to uplift and inspire generations through songs that have become anthems."" Civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson had been friends with Aretha Franklin for more than 60 years 1967's Respect became the anthem of the civil rights campaign and the feminist movement. Franklintold Elle magazine,externalin 2016 she was ""stunned"" by its success. ""It was the right song at the right time,"" she said. As she rose in popularity, Franklin did not abandon her sense of activism. She told Elle her contract in the 1960s included the clause that she would never perform for a segregated audience. Civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson - who was Franklin's friend for over 60 years -told USA Today,externalshe helped pay for many civil rights tours and campaigns while King was alive. She held free concerts, housed activists and helped them fundraise. Jackson called her ""an inspiration, not just an entertainer"". ""She has shared her points of view from the stage for challenged people, to register to vote, to stand up for decency,"" he said. Aretha Franklin shared a special relationship with the Obamas The Queen of Soul remained a prominent face - and voice - for African American civil rights throughout her life. In 2015, President Barack Obama said: ""American history wells up when Aretha sings."" ""Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R&B, rock and roll - the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope.""

House of Fraser cancels all online orders,"Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser. Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed Â£484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at Â£884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct boughtthe chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed Â£30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than Â£950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by Â£2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to Â£1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost Â£1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" House of Fraser's website has been taken offline Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" Rob Brice's wife and grandmother on their wedding day Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given Â£500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about Â£380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between Â£40m and Â£49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering Â£1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for Â£100m - Â£10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be Â£600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full. Q: Can I return an unwanted item bought online for a refund? Yes. Anyone wanting to return existing purchases will have their statutory rights honoured. Q: What happens to gift vouchers? Customers with a store card should write to Gift Cards, 27 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AH and it will be replaced by one of equivalent value for use in future House of Fraser (but not Sports Direct) stores.

Wheat gene map to help 'feed the world',"The starting pistol has been fired in a race to develop ""climate change resistant"" wheat with the publication of a map of the crop's genes. An international team of scientists has identified the location of more than 100,000 wheat genes. The researchers say the map will accelerate the development of new strains to cope with the increased heat waves expected from climate change. Theresearch,externalhas been published in the journal Science. Professor Cristobal Uauy, who is a project leader in crop genetics at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, described the pinpointing of wheat genes as ""a game changer"". ""We need to find ways to make sustainable production of wheat in the face of climate change and increasing demand,"" he told BBC News. ""This is something we've been waiting for  for many years. The whole of human civilisation should be very excited with this because for the first time now we'll be able to make the advances that scientists and plant breeders have wanted to do in wheat in a much more targeted manner and so feed the world in the future."" The UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that wheat production needs to be increased by 60% by 2050 to feed the population, which by then will have grown to 9.6 billion. Much of this work is being carried out by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), based near Mexico City. It is an organisation devoted to developing new varieties to boost production for farmers in some of the world's poorest countries. For decades CIMMYT has been trying to increase yields and stave off new strains of diseases by releasing new varieties created by traditional cross breeding. But the expected increase in heat waves caused by climate change has now made the development of varieties that need less water and tolerate higher temperatures their top priority, according to CIMMYT's head of wheat research, Dr Ravi Singh. ""During the critical few months of the growing period if you have a one degree rise in night temperature you lose 8% of the yield, so climate resilience is one of the major factors in our breeding programmes,"" he said. Salmon given GM feed to boost nutrition Gene-edited farm animals are on their way Gene editing is GM, says European Court Scientists develop thousands of new varieties of wheat each year using traditional cross breeding, where traits are selected for by eye. The process works well but it is painstaking and expensive. It is also a numbers game because each time varieties are crossed it is a lottery as to whether the resulting crop has the correct combination of the desired genes from the parent strains. It can take between 10 and 15 years to develop a new variety and have it in a farmer's field. Researchers have now identified more than 100,000 genes and their position in the DNA of wheat. They have in effect produced a map which shows and labels all the most important places on the wheat genome. By knowing where all the genes are, researchers will now be able to discover how they work together to control traits such as drought resistance, increased nutritional value and higher yield. And by using gene editing techniques they can add the traits they need more quickly and precisely. Further information: Genome complexity,external Proposal to sequence genomes of all life on Earth,external Picture credits: Getty Images. Critics of the use of gene editing to boost production argue that there is sufficient food in the world. The problem is that it is not distributed to those that need it. The director of CIMMYT's global wheat programme, Dr Hans Braun, agrees. But he believes that a political solution is much harder than a gene editing one. ""For example in North Africa and West Asia, wheat accounts for between 40% and 50% of all calories. It is absolutely highest priority for national food security for countries in the region to produce enough wheat. They import a lot already and the more the more they import the more they are dependent on other countries,"" he explained. Dr Helen Wallace of the campaign group Genewatch UK said that researchers should be careful not to ""over-promise"". ""In reality, what gene editing can deliver will be limited by the complexity of wheat and its environmental  interactions, "" she said. ""Altered nutrition, for example, can sometimes make a crop more attractive to pests, or have adverse effects for some people eating it. Strict regulation, traceability and labelling will be key to protecting the environment, health and consumer choice"". The gene map for wheat is a result of a mammoth effort by two hundred scientists from 73 research organisations in 20 countries. Together they have identified the composition of 21 wheat chromosomes and the precise location of 107,891 genes. It has 16 billion separate chemical building blocks of DNA - which is more than five times larger than the human genome which was completes nearly 20 years ago. As if that weren't enough of a challenge, wheat has three separate sub-genomes. This has made it difficult for scientists to distinguish each sub-genome and to put them together in their correct order.

Early galaxies found 'on our cosmic doorstep',"A computer simulation of galaxy formation: White circles show some of the most ancient building blocks Some of the earliest galaxies to form in the Universe are sitting on our cosmic doorstep, according to a study. These faint objects close to the Milky Way could be more than 13 billion years old, researchers from the universities of Durham and Harvard explain. They formed upwards of a hundred million years after the Big Bang and contained some of the first stars to light up the cosmos. The findingsare published in the Astrophysical Journal.,external Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is one of billions out there in the Universe. These sprawling cosmic neighbourhoods filled with stars and planets formed when many smaller building blocks - such as these galaxies - collided and merged. The discovery opens a window into what the Universe was like more than 13 billion years ago. Prof Carlos Frenk, fromDurham University,external, UK, said: ""Finding some of the very first galaxies that formed in our Universe orbiting in the Milky Way's own backyard is the astronomical equivalent of finding the remains of the first humans that inhabited the Earth. It is hugely exciting."" Prof Frenk compared the discovery with finding the earliest humans to inhabit the Earth Lead author Dr Sownak Bose, from theHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,externalin Cambridge, US, told BBC News: ""For some of these tiny satellites, maybe 50% or even 90% of their mass was assembled at a time when the Universe was less than one billion years old."" The astronomers looked at something called the ""luminosity function"" of small satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way and its neighbour Andromeda. Luminosity describes the total amount of energy radiated each second by an astronomical source. The ""function"" gives the abundance of galaxies for a given luminosity. When the luminosity functions were plotted on a graph, the galaxies separated into two distinct populations. Prof Frenk, Dr Bose and co-author Dr Alis Deason from Durham found an existing model of galaxy formation explained the data perfectly, allowing them to infer the formation times of the satellite galaxies. The first population of galaxies appears to have been formed during the ""cosmic dark ages"", a period of cooling which began some 380,000 years after the Big Bang and lasted for 100 million years. The second population, consisting of slightly brighter galaxies, seems to have formed hundreds of millions of years after the first. The data agree well with existing models of galaxy formation The onset of the cosmic dark ages is tied to the formation of the very first atoms in the Universe. These were hydrogen atoms, the simplest element in the periodic table. As the hydrogen gathered into clouds, it began to cool. These hydrogen clouds then settled within small clumps of the enigmatic stuff known as dark matter, which emerged in the Big Bang. As the name suggests, dark matter neither reflects nor emits visible light, yet it makes up 85% of all matter in the Universe. The reason the two populations of galaxies are so distinct is that the first galaxies emitted intense ultraviolet radiation while the Universe was still locked in the dark ages. This destroyed the remaining hydrogen atoms by ionising them (knocking out their electrons), making it difficult for this gas to cool and form new stars. Consequently, the process of galaxy formation ground to a halt and no new galaxies were able to form for the next billion years or so. This next cosmological phase goes by the name ""reionisation"". The hiatus came to an end when the clumps of dark matter into which the gas had settled became so massive that even that ionised gas was able to cool down. This allowed galaxy formation to resume, leading to spectacular bright galaxies; one of which is our Milky Way. Artwork: The Milky Way is surrounded by ""dwarf"" satellite galaxies The galaxy evolution model favoured by the astronomers predicts that there should be a ""kink"" in the transition between the fainter galaxies and the brighter galaxies - as determined by their luminosity functions. This should correspond to the billion-year stoppage in galaxy formation caused by the ionisation of gas towards the end of the dark ages. It's exactly what the researchers saw in their data. Further study should help flesh out our understanding. ""If you go and examine these primitive galaxies, you should find bizarre things about them. Being the first ones, they should have properties that are unique to them,"" said Prof Frenk. Dr Bose explained: ""One could think that, maybe some of these pre-reionisation galaxies are more compact than their counterparts that formed afterwards. They were formed at a time when the Universe was much denser, because the Universe was smaller."" While hydrogen and helium were made in the Big Bang, the other, the heavier chemical elements we're made of were produced inside stars. When stars go supernova, they pollute the galactic environment with their chemical constituents. However, the abundance of different elements in the Universe has changed with time. So it's possible that the way they're distributed in the earliest galaxies is different to how they're dispersed in ones that formed after reionisation. Although these ancient galaxies are found on our cosmic doorstep, that's because being relatively close made these faint objects easier to find. However, these cosmic relics should be found throughout in the Universe and may, in fact, far outnumber bright galaxies like the Milky Way.

And fellow Conservative Brexiteer Conor Burns told the Telegraph: ""The thing that we want to avoid for 'generations to come' is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don't have a seat around the table"". It comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials, amid growing speculation about the possibility of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal in March 2019. Theresa May and ministers have been meeting EU counterparts over the summer On Friday, Danish finance minister Kristian Jensen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Theresa May's Brexit plan drawn up at Chequers was a ""realistic proposal for good negotiations"". But asked about comments by Latvia's foreign minister, that the chance of a no-deal Brexit was ""50-50"", he said: ""I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we've got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU."" Mr Hunt told ITV on Thursday that he believed the government's Chequers plan was the ""framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based"". But he said, although the UK must be ""prepared for all outcomes"", if the UK were to leave without a negotiated deal: ""It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we were to see a fissure, if we had a messy, ugly divorce.

Chorley Council football fan U-turnChorley Council apologises for a letter stating it wished to stop football fans from visiting the Lancashire town.BBC Sport,"Buses of fans often stop in Chorley prior to attending a number of local clubs Chorley Council has reversed its position on football fans not being welcome in the town and apologised for any offence caused to supporters. The Lancashire town's local authority sent a letter to local clubsstating supporters were ""intimidating"" when coaches stopped in the town. The stance was criticised by the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF). But Chorley Council now says it does ""welcome football fans"" and that the ""vast majority"" boost local business. ""What we can't have, and which is what triggered the concerns from traders, is a situation where large groups of fans are gathering in pubs, spilling out on to the streets and intimidating, or being seen to be intimidating other people using the town centre,"" a council statement read. ""In the letter it stated that travelling away fans would not be welcome in Chorley - this is not the case we do welcome football fans and we apologise for this comment and any offence this may have caused."" In reacting to the council's initial letter, local resident Craig Riding said he had ""never been more embarrassed as a Chorley resident and as a football fan"". The FSF said it was seeking legal advice over the move to keep fans away from the town but Chorley Council says it will now write to local clubs to ""clarify the situation"". The town is a regular stop-off for fans on their way to games at Bolton, Blackburn, Preston, Burnley and Wigan. Local Parish councillor Malcolm Allen - who is part of the Town Centre Team behind the initial letter - told BBC Sport fans are ""dumped"" on the town as they are unable to easily access alcohol ""near the ground they are going to"". He stressed that fans are however ""very welcome if they behave"", while some local business owners told the BBC they have not witnessed trouble from fans.

'Queen of Soul' Aretha Franklin dies,"This video can not be played Aretha Franklin: In her own words Aretha Franklin, the ""queen of soul"" known for hits like Respect and Think, has died in Detroit at the age of 76. The legendary singer was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 andannounced last yearshe was retiring from music. Franklin won 18 Grammys, and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits over a music career spanning seven decades. The star gave her final performance last November at a gala in New York held in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. In a statement, her family said: ""In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart. ""We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins knew no bounds."" The family also confirmed her death was due to advanced pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type. Stars pay tribute to Aretha Franklin Obituary: Aretha Franklin Aretha Franklin: A life in pictures Born in Memphis to a gospel singer/pianist and a celebrated Baptist preacher, Franklin was tutored from an early age by such gospel stars as Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. She struggled to find fame in the early years, with record label Columbia unsure how to frame her impressively powerful voice. The late 1960's saw some of Franklin's most soulful and fiery performances After moving to Atlantic Records in 1966 she broke through, and released some of her most iconic songs like Respect soon after the switch. By 1968 she was renowned throughout America and Europe as ""Lady Soul"" - a symbol of black pride who appeared on the cover of Time and was given an award by Martin Luther King. Reaction to the death of the soul legend has poured in throughout Thursday - as high-profile figures paid tribute to her musical legacy and commitment to US civil rights. Sir Elton John,externalsaid he ""adored and worshipped"" the star, and wrote: ""the loss of Aretha Franklin is a blow for everybody who loves real music."" Former BeatleSir Paul McCartney wrote:,external""Let's all take a moment to give thanks for the beautiful life of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of our souls, who inspired us all for many many years."" This video can not be played Aretha Franklin singing at Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 Mariah Carey paid tribute to the Queen of Soul on Twitter, calling her an inspiration, mentor and friend. A number of other stars including John Legend, Britney Spears and Tony Bennett shared their memories.

""No one can discuss the civil rights movement nor music without paying respect to the Queen of Soul,"" NAACP chairman Leon W. Russell said She gave her last performance in New York last November Respect- US number one and double Grammy winner in 1967 (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman- a top 10 US hit in 1967 Chain of Fools- reached number two in the US in 1968 Think- another US top 10 hit in '68 I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)- a duet with George Michael, number one in the US and UK in 1987 Franklin performed an eye-catching cameo in cult comedy The Blues Brothers, and then she scored a number of big hits in the 1980s including Who's Zooming Who? and the George Michael duet I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me). She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in 2005, when she was saluted for ""capturing the hearts of millions of Americans"". Ten years later she reduced President Barack Obama to tears when she sang (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman at a Kennedy Center Honours ceremony, having previously performed at his inauguration. The BBC's Sima Kotecha interviewed Franklin in Detroit in 2007, and shared memories on Thursday of meeting the international star who ""put her at ease straight away"" ""She was warm, honest, generous. Her candid responses were refreshing and spoke volumes about her experience as a big star in the global media spotlight."" Analysis from Mark Savage, BBC music reporter Aretha Franklin's music moved millions of people and sound-tracked social change over five decades Nobody could inhabit a song like Aretha Franklin. You only have to compare Otis Redding's original recording of Respect to Aretha's version to hear it. His is superb. Hers is otherworldly. Even her most thunderous performances retained their humanity - something her shoutier disciples often overlooked. Five ways Aretha Franklin made history The desolate colours she painted onto the verses of Carole King's (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman made the release of the chorus even more joyous. In later years, she was let down by the material she chose (or which was chosen for her) but her performances still had the poetry and power to move audiences - including, notably, Barack Obama - to tears.

Tributes flood in for Aretha Franklin,"This video can not be played Sister Sledge and the Rev Jesse Jackson are among those who have paid tribute Aretha Franklin Tributes are pouring in from the worlds of entertainment and politics for Aretha Franklin, the US singer known as the Queen of Soul, who has died at 76. Franklin performed at inauguration events for three US presidents and was a powerful advocate for the civil rights movement. ""For more than 50 years, she stirred our souls,"" Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement. Barack Obama said her music had ""helped define the American Experience"". Remembered for hits like Respect and I Say A Little Prayer, Franklin won 18 Grammys and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits over a musical career spanning seven decades.

The singer died at her home in Detroit surrounded by family and loved ones, her family said in a statement. Tributes have appeared at the singer's Hollywood Walk of Fame star In 2005, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush, when she was saluted for ""capturing the hearts of millions of Americans"". She was ""one of America's greatest national treasures"", the Clintons said. ""She was elegant, graceful, and utterly uncompromising in her artistry."" Mr Obama said in a joint statement with his wife Michelle: ""In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade -- our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect.

""In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart,"" it said. ""We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins knew no bounds."" Franklin gave her final performance last November at a gala in New York held in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. Born in Memphis to a gospel singer/pianist and a celebrated Baptist preacher, Franklin was tutored from an early age by such gospel stars as Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. She struggled to find fame in the early years - the Columbia record label was unsure how to frame her powerful voice. This video can not be played Aretha Franklin: In her own words After moving to Atlantic Records in 1966, she made her breakthrough, releasing some of her most iconic songs like Respect. By 1968 she was renowned throughout America and Europe as ""Lady Soul"" - a symbol of black pride who appeared on the cover of Time and was given an award by Martin Luther King. She gave her last performance in New York last November Respect- US number one and double Grammy winner in 1967 (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman- a top 10 US hit in 1967 Chain of Fools- reached number two in the US in 1968 Think- another US top 10 hit in '68 I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)- a duet with George Michael, number one in the US and UK in 1987 Sir Elton John,externalsaid he had ""adored and worshipped"" her: ""The loss of Aretha Franklin is a blow for everybody who loves real music."" Former BeatleSir Paul McCartney wrote:,external""Let's all take a moment to give thanks for the beautiful life of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of our souls, who inspired us all for many many years."" Mariah Carey paid tribute on Twitter, calling Franklin an inspiration, mentor and friend. A number of other stars including John Legend, Britney Spears and Tony Bennett shared their memories. Analysis from Mark Savage, BBC music reporter Nobody could inhabit a song like Aretha Franklin. You only have to compare Otis Redding's original recording of Respect to Aretha's version to hear it. His is superb. Hers is otherworldly. Even her most thunderous performances retained their humanity - something her shoutier disciples often overlooked. Five ways Aretha Franklin made history The desolate colours she painted onto the verses of Carole King's (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman made the release of the chorus even more joyous. Even in later years her performances still had the poetry and power to move audiences - including, notably, Barack Obama - to tears.

Chorley Council football fan U-turn,"Buses of fans often stop in Chorley prior to attending a number of local clubs Chorley Council has reversed its position on football fans not being welcome in the town and apologised for any offence caused to supporters. The Lancashire town's local authority sent a letter to local clubsstating supporters were ""intimidating"" when coaches stopped in the town. The stance was criticised by the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF). But Chorley Council now says it does ""welcome football fans"" and that the ""vast majority"" boost local business. ""What we can't have, and which is what triggered the concerns from traders, is a situation where large groups of fans are gathering in pubs, spilling out on to the streets and intimidating, or being seen to be intimidating other people using the town centre,"" a council statement read. ""In the letter it stated that travelling away fans would not be welcome in Chorley - this is not the case we do welcome football fans and we apologise for this comment and any offence this may have caused."" In reacting to the council's initial letter, local resident Craig Riding said he had ""never been more embarrassed as a Chorley resident and as a football fan"". The FSF said it was seeking legal advice over the move to keep fans away from the town but Chorley Council says it will now write to local clubs to ""clarify the situation"". The town is a regular stop-off for fans on their way to games at Bolton, Blackburn, Preston, Burnley and Wigan. Local Parish councillor Malcolm Allen - who is part of the Town Centre Team behind the initial letter - told BBC Sport fans are ""dumped"" on the town as they are unable to easily access alcohol ""near the ground they are going to"". He stressed that fans are however ""very welcome if they behave"", while some local business owners told the BBC they have not witnessed trouble from fans.

"Rugby star Cipriani 'truly sorry' for assaultThe England rugby player says he is ""truly sorry"" after admitting assault and resisting arrest.Jersey","This video can not be played Cipriani leaves Jersey court after assault charge England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been fined Â£2,000 after an assault in a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester player pleaded guilty to common assault and resisting arrest and was ordered to pay Â£250 compensation to a woman police officer. She has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill. Three other charges - assault on police, larceny and being disorderly on licensed premises - were dropped. More stories from the Channel Islands Ciprianitweeted,externalhe was ""truly sorry... most importantly [to] the police"" and was ""mortified"" by his actions. The 30-year-old fly-half has seven days to pay the fine and compensation or face 10 weeks in prison. The officer has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill Defence advocate Mike Preston told Jersey Magistrates' Court Cipriani was sorry for the ""confusing situation"" and was ""mortified if he harmed the police officer in any way"". Mr Preston said Cipriani ""had too many drinks"" at Drift nightclub in The Royal Yacht Hotel, St Helier, and police were called when he tried to grab a body camera off a doorman. Mr Preston argued his client did this because fame had made him more sensitive to being filmed and he was confused by the situation. He was later picked up by police but managed to escape from his cuffs and a second officer was needed to restrain him. Police were called after Cipriani tried to grab a doorman's body camera at Drift nightclub Cipriani is said to have sworn at the officer, telling her to get off him. The court heard she was left with bruises on her bicep and red marks on her neck. The former Wasps and Sale stand-off did not think he had done anything wrong at the time and did not understand why the police had been called, the court was told. The club is part of The Royal Yacht Hotel in St Helier He was in Jersey with his club as part of a pre-season tour and was supported in court by Gloucester team captain Willi Heinz. Cipriani, who moved to Kingsholm in the summer, is due to make his debut in a friendly against Ulster on Saturday. In response to his player's guilty plea, Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan commented: ""We will deal with it in a robust but balanced way but based purely on the facts. ""As a high-profile sportsperson there is often a large degree of public and media scrutiny involved, which Danny is well aware of. ""The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved. ""He knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club. However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support.""

Last week Cipriani vowed to ""do everything"" to remain in the England set-up after making his first Test match start in 10 years during the summer tour to South Africa. He was dropped from the national side in 2008 - the same year he won his first cap - after visiting a nightclub prior to a match against Scotland. In 2011, Cipriani was fined by his then club Melbourne Rebels for taking a bottle of vodka from a nightclub and later in the same year served a one-match ban for breaking a team curfew. Four years later he was banned for driving for 18 months and ordered to pay fines and costs totalling Â£7,620 after being found to be nearly twice the drink-drive limit. Cipriani has played 16 times for England since his international debut in 2008 Over the last year or so the rugby had really been doing the talking for Danny Cipriani. Many thought he wouldn't get a look in under Eddie Jones but Jones recalled him for the tour of South Africa in June. He kept his head down, worked extremely hard on the tour, got a start in the third Test and set up the try which led to an England victory. I think in terms of his club future, Gloucester will put it down as an incident they can move on from. At the moment, England are staying very tight-lipped. It's pretty hard to second guess Eddie Jones' position. In the past, Jones has said that what happens on club duty is not to do with him and that if someone behaves themselves on and off the field in an England camp, that's what he's interested in. On the tour of South Africa, Cipriani's behaviour was exemplary and Jones made a big point of saying that before selecting Cipriani for the third Test. But with the World Cup on the horizon, no England players can afford slip-ups, let alone players whose behaviour in the past has been called into question. Cipriani just had to keep his head down. He was probably in the best place he's been in for a decade. Gloucester were saying Cipriani had been worked extremely hard in pre-season and that he'd been a fantastic addition to the club. Up until Tuesday night, things were going swimmingly. He must just feel so disappointed with himself. His international future is now hanging by a thread.

"Wheat gene map to help 'feed the world'Researchers are set to develop higher yield wheat varieties that require less water following the identification of more than 100,000 of its genes.","The starting pistol has been fired in a race to develop ""climate change resistant"" wheat with the publication of a map of the crop's genes. An international team of scientists has identified the location of more than 100,000 wheat genes. The researchers say the map will accelerate the development of new strains to cope with the increased heat waves expected from climate change. Theresearch,externalhas been published in the journal Science. Professor Cristobal Uauy, who is a project leader in crop genetics at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, described the pinpointing of wheat genes as ""a game changer"". ""We need to find ways to make sustainable production of wheat in the face of climate change and increasing demand,"" he told BBC News. ""This is something we've been waiting for  for many years. The whole of human civilisation should be very excited with this because for the first time now we'll be able to make the advances that scientists and plant breeders have wanted to do in wheat in a much more targeted manner and so feed the world in the future."" The UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that wheat production needs to be increased by 60% by 2050 to feed the population, which by then will have grown to 9.6 billion. Much of this work is being carried out by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), based near Mexico City. It is an organisation devoted to developing new varieties to boost production for farmers in some of the world's poorest countries. For decades CIMMYT has been trying to increase yields and stave off new strains of diseases by releasing new varieties created by traditional cross breeding. But the expected increase in heat waves caused by climate change has now made the development of varieties that need less water and tolerate higher temperatures their top priority, according to CIMMYT's head of wheat research, Dr Ravi Singh. ""During the critical few months of the growing period if you have a one degree rise in night temperature you lose 8% of the yield, so climate resilience is one of the major factors in our breeding programmes,"" he said. Salmon given GM feed to boost nutrition Gene-edited farm animals are on their way Gene editing is GM, says European Court Scientists develop thousands of new varieties of wheat each year using traditional cross breeding, where traits are selected for by eye. The process works well but it is painstaking and expensive. It is also a numbers game because each time varieties are crossed it is a lottery as to whether the resulting crop has the correct combination of the desired genes from the parent strains. It can take between 10 and 15 years to develop a new variety and have it in a farmer's field. Researchers have now identified more than 100,000 genes and their position in the DNA of wheat. They have in effect produced a map which shows and labels all the most important places on the wheat genome. By knowing where all the genes are, researchers will now be able to discover how they work together to control traits such as drought resistance, increased nutritional value and higher yield. And by using gene editing techniques they can add the traits they need more quickly and precisely. Further information: Genome complexity,external Proposal to sequence genomes of all life on Earth,external Picture credits: Getty Images. Critics of the use of gene editing to boost production argue that there is sufficient food in the world. The problem is that it is not distributed to those that need it. The director of CIMMYT's global wheat programme, Dr Hans Braun, agrees. But he believes that a political solution is much harder than a gene editing one. ""For example in North Africa and West Asia, wheat accounts for between 40% and 50% of all calories. It is absolutely highest priority for national food security for countries in the region to produce enough wheat. They import a lot already and the more the more they import the more they are dependent on other countries,"" he explained. Dr Helen Wallace of the campaign group Genewatch UK said that researchers should be careful not to ""over-promise"". ""In reality, what gene editing can deliver will be limited by the complexity of wheat and its environmental  interactions, "" she said. ""Altered nutrition, for example, can sometimes make a crop more attractive to pests, or have adverse effects for some people eating it. Strict regulation, traceability and labelling will be key to protecting the environment, health and consumer choice"". The gene map for wheat is a result of a mammoth effort by two hundred scientists from 73 research organisations in 20 countries. Together they have identified the composition of 21 wheat chromosomes and the precise location of 107,891 genes. It has 16 billion separate chemical building blocks of DNA - which is more than five times larger than the human genome which was completes nearly 20 years ago. As if that weren't enough of a challenge, wheat has three separate sub-genomes. This has made it difficult for scientists to distinguish each sub-genome and to put them together in their correct order.

Corbyn 'unaware' of militant group figureThe Labour leader continues to face criticism over a 2014 wreath-laying ceremony.UK Politics,"Maher Taher (pictured wearing a jacket but without a tie, next to Jeremy Corbyn) was a senior figure in the PFLP Jeremy Corbyn has said he did not know that a man he stood next to at a wreath-laying ceremony was a senior member of a militant Palestinian group. Maher Taher, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP), was pictured alongside the Labour leader at a 2014 event in Tunis. The PLFP was later linked to an attack on an Israeli synagogue. The US and EU consider it to be a terrorist group. Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""I was unaware of any of his background."" He was asked about the latest in a series of newspaper reports scrutinising his presence at the wreath-laying ceremony, which he attended during a trip to a Palestinian rights conference in the Tunisian capital. Gordon Brown says Corbyn 'has to change' Corbyn wreath row explained Israeli PM attacks Corbyn in wreath row ""I don't share platforms with terrorists,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""I don't believe in killing people. ""I have attended memorial events for those that have died in the sadness of all of these conflicts, and that is my position."" Labour has complained to the press watchdog about newspaper coverage of his trip, claiming that reporting in the Daily Mail, Sun, Times, Daily Telegraph, Express and Metro newspapers had ""seriously misrepresented the event"" and ""underplayed the role of mainstream Palestinian leaders conducting the ceremony"". Mr Corbyn has said that his attendance at the wreath-laying was to honour innocent people killed in a 1985 Israeli air strike on the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) headquarters in Tunis. However, reports have pointed out he was pictured with a wreath near memorials for people accused of having links to a terrorist attack in which 11 hostages from the Israeli Olympic team and a West German policeman were killed during the 1972 Munich Games. Read more about the 1972 Munich Olympics attack High-level Palestinian figures were present at the ceremony, including Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad, the Palestinian ambassador to Tunisia, Salman el-Herfi, and Maher Taher, a senior figure in the PFLP's political wing. ThePLFP was formed as a resistance movementafter the occupation of the West Bank by Israel in 1967. It is treated as a terrorist organisation by the US and European Union. In November 2014, two members of the group armed with axes stormed a synagogue complex in West Jerusalem and killedfour rabbis - including British-born Avraham Shmuel Goldberg. According to reports at the time, it was not clear how involved the PFLP leadership had been in the attack. Labour remainsembroiled in a row about anti-Semitism with the party. It has adopted a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, but critics say it is not as comprehensive as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines . On Thursday, union boss Len McCluskey called on the party to adopt the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and said Labour had been ""insensitive"" on the issue. But hewrote in the Huffington Post,externalthat anti-Semitism in Labour, while ""not manufactured"" had ""certainly been wildly exaggerated"". He said Jewish community leaders had shown ""intransigent hostility"" to Mr Corbyn and urged them to ""abandon their truculent hostility, engage in dialogue and dial down the rhetoric, before the political estrangement between them and the Labour Party becomes entrenched."" He also suggested some Labour MPs were using the row to ""provide rocket fuel for a split in the party"". In response, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: ""We note that Len McCluskey has advocated the adoption of the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and its illustrative examples. ""However, his attack on the Jewish community is both unfair and unwarranted."" No Corbyn apology after wreath criticism Corbyn wreath row explained Corbyn reacts to 'terror memorial' claims.

Sweden Muslim woman wins handshake caseAn interpreting firm had cut short her job interview after she refused to shake hands with a man.,"Ms Alhajeh said she brought the case on behalf of others who could find themselves in the same position A Swedish Muslim woman has won compensation after her job interview was ended when she refused a handshake. Farah Alhajeh, 24, was applying for a job as an interpreter when she declined to shake the hand of a male interviewer for religious reasons. She placed her hand over her heart in greeting instead. The Swedish labour court ruled the company had discriminated against her and ordered it to pay 40,000 kronor ($4,350; Â£3,420) in compensation. Some Muslims avoid physical contact with members of the opposite sex, except for those in their immediate family. However handshakes are traditional in Europe. Additionally, anti-discrimination legislation may forbid companies and public bodies from treating people differently because of their gender. Is it easier to get a job as Adam or Mohamed? Muslim women 'most disadvantaged' Half US Muslims 'discriminated against' Sweden's discrimination ombudsman's office, which represented 24-year-old Ms Alhajeh, said the judgement had taken into account ""the employer's interests, the individual's right to bodily integrity, and the importance of the state to maintain protection for religious freedom"". The interpreting company in Ms Alhajeh's home town of Uppsala had argued that its staff were required to treat men and women equally and could not allow a staff member to refuse a handshake based on gender. But the discrimination ombudsman said she had tried to avoid upsetting anyone by placing her hand over her heart when greeting both men and women. Sweden's labour court found the company was justified in demanding equal treatment for both sexes - but not in demanding that it be in the form of a handshake only. Her refusal to shake hands on religious grounds was protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, it said, and the company's policy in demanding a specific greeting was detrimental to Muslims. The court also disagreed with the firm's assertion that Ms Alhajeh's approach to greetings would cause a problem for effective communication as an interpreter. However the judges were divided over the case - with three supporting Ms Alhajeh's claim and two voting against. After the judgement Ms Alhajeh told the BBC she believed it was important to ""never give in"" when convinced that one is in the right, even as a member of a minority group. ""I believe in God, which is very rare in Sweden... and I should be able to do that and be accepted as long as I'm not hurting anyone,"" she said. ""In my country... you cannot treat women and men differently. I respect that. That's why I don't have any physical contact with men or with women. I can live by the rules of my religion and also at the same time follow the rules of the country that I live in,"" she added. She had complained about her treatment to the discrimination ombudsman's office, which said that the ""difficult issue"" was important enough to go to a court for judgement. In 2016a Swiss school's decision to exempt two Muslim boys from shaking both male and female teachers' handsafter they refused to shake the hand of a female teacher caused uproar and led to the family's citizenship process being suspended In April,an Algerian woman was denied French citizenshipafter refusing to shake the hand of an official during her citizenship ceremony Muslim women 'most disadvantaged' Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job?

Toy gun sparked armed police response,"This video can not be played Armed police tackled Filip Nowak after he waved a gun in a park A student triggered a stand-off with armed police after waving a toy gun at people in a busy park. Police were called to Cwmdonkin Park in Swansea after reports of a man pointing a ""machine gun"". Filip Adam Nowak, 25, of Clydach, was given a suspended six-month jail sentence at Swansea Crown Court after admitting carrying an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Speaking after the case Nowak said: ""I feel I have been labelled a terrorist."" The drama unfolded when police were called to the Walter Road area of the city on 15 June, following reports of a man pointing a weapon at passers-by. South Wales Police sent firearm officers who found Nowak at the park, which was packed with children at the time. Armed officers ordered Nowak on the ground in the park They approached him from a distance, instructed him to get to his knees and called out: ""Where is the gun?"" They arrested him and recovered his backpack on the ground with a plastic toy gun device resting behind it. The gun was described as having ""MI6 imitation electric sound toy gun"" inscribed on it. Novak, a polish national who was studying graphic design, admitted waving the imitation weapon which he claimed he had found while walking home from university. Judge Huw Rees described the incident as ""foolhardy in the extreme."" He added: ""You were seen by a witness and he was so afraid he drove off. That's the effect these incidents have on people. Nowak was arrested at the popular city park ""Guns have no place in our society - actual or copy guns. There is a constant need for people to be vigilant. ""There is a heightened state of alert against terror currently in this country and it beggars belief how someone can do something so reckless and pointless and dangerous."" Nowak was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months. He was also given a community order and must carry out 120 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement. Following the conclusion of the case Nowak said: ""It was never my intention what people have said online. I feel I have been labelled a terrorist to the public. ""I picked up an accessory but some people saw it and thought I was a threat to the public. ""I feel it has been blown out of proportion. ""I have no intention of being a threat. It was just a big mistake.""

Mosque sermon 'called for armed jihad',"This video can not be played Hear from the man who 'called for armed jihad' at Didsbury Mosque A sermon at the mosque where the Manchester bomber worshipped called for the support of armed jihadist fighters, according to two Muslim scholars. An imam at Didsbury Mosque in December 2016 was recorded praying for ""victory"" for ""our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq"". Scholars Usama Hasan and Shaykh Rehan said it referred to ""military jihad"". The imam, Mustafa Graf, says his sermon did not call for armed jihad and he has never preached radical Islam. The recording the BBC obtained is of Friday prayers at the mosque six months before Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb following an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in May 2017. Abedi and his family regularly attended the mosque and his father sometimes led the call to prayer. What is jihadism? The family's whereabouts on the day of the sermon are unknown but the BBC has been told that Abedi bought a ticket for the concert 10 days later. The bomb killed 22 people and the attacker, as well as injuring hundreds of others. It is also understood at least five men who have attended Didsbury Mosque have either travelled to Syria or have been jailed for terrorism offences. Greater Manchester Police said they had the BBC's material and were reviewing it ""to establish if any criminal offences have been committed"". Imam Mustafa Graf has denied ever preaching Islamic extremism The sermon, which was at a time of bombing in the Syrian city of Aleppo, includes prayers for ""mujahideen"" fighting abroad - a term commonly used for Islamist guerrilla fighters. ""We ask Allah to grant them mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory,"" Mr Graf is heard saying. Elsewhere it says: ""Lots of brothers stayed behind unfortunately. They love Islam and Muslims but they do nothing for the support of their brothers and sisters."" Another passage says: ""Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation."" Did MI5 miss bomber amid Navy rescue? What we know about Manchester bomber Manchester attack: The victims Mr Hasan, head of Islamic studies at Quilliam, a think tank that focuses on counter-extremism, said: ""From the context and the way these texts [the religious passages quoted within the sermon] are used they are clearly referring to military jihad, to armed jihad. ""I have known the Islamic discourse for pretty much 40 years, from being a child in this country and worldwide, and the mujahideen are the group fighting armed jihad."" Mr Rehan said he was in no doubt about what the sermon meant. ""The jihad he's referring to here is actually being on the battlefield, there's no ifs and no buts in this."" The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations. At one point Mr Graf is heard saying: ""The whole world, including Europe, America - what is the so-called civilised world - is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria. ""They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. ""Well in fact they helped the Russians and the Iranians and others, the militias, to kill Muslims over there."" The word ""jihad"" is widely used, though often inaccurately, by Western politicians and media. In Arabic, the word means ""effort"" or ""struggle"". In Islam, it could be an individual's internal struggle against baser instincts, the struggle to build a good Muslim society, or a war for the faith against unbelievers. Mr Rehan said: ""He's giving them the narrative of them against us. He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action."" Connections between the preacher and Salman Abedi have also been uncovered. The BBC has obtained footage of Abedi attending a demonstration in London against a secular Libyan general who was fighting against Islamist militia. The event was organised by the so-called 17th of February Forum protest group. Mr Graf is a leader of the group, although he was not present at the London demonstration. Mr Graf declined to be interviewed by the BBC but denied he had called for armed jihad or that he had ever preached Islamic extremism. The trustees of Didsbury Mosque also said the five men understood to have travelled to Syria or jailed for terrorism offences had not visited the mosque. In a statement it said Mr Graf's sermon was highlighting the plight of Syrians and his use of the words ""jihad"" and ""mujahideen"" had been misinterpreted. ""We do not tolerate or instigate any form of preaching that breaches both Islamic principles and the laws of England and Wales,"" it said.

'Miracle escape' stories emerge in Genoa,"This video can not be played Luciano Goccia: 'I was under the bridge when it collapsed' Hair-raising stories of narrow escapes from the Italian motorway bridge collapse have emerged, two days after the disaster in Genoa. A salesman was saved by firefighters after his falling van got caught in the wreckage of the bridge, while his companion plunged to his death. At least 38 people died and 15 were injured when the bridge fell. Between 10 and 20 people may still be missing under the rubble, Genoa's chief prosecutor has told reporters. Francesco Cozzi told Reuters news agency by telephone that this was the working hypothesis based on information from relatives who had not heard from family members and the number of vehicles thought to have been on the bridge when it went down. Dozens of vehicles dropped when a huge tower and a section of the Morandi bridge measuring about 200m (656ft) collapsed about 45m on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The Morandi, which was built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, Italy's main land corridor with France. Hundreds of people are unable to return to homes under the bridge Infrastructure across Italy will be double-checked in the aftermath of the disaster, the government has promised. The bridge's operator, Autostrade per l'Italia, is under mounting pressure from politicians and share traders, with the government threatening to terminate contracts and impose heavy fines. At one point in morning trading, shares in Autostrade's holding company, Atlantia, fell by as much as 25%. What we know so far The victims of the Genoa Bridge collapse Games off after Genoa bridge disaster The daring rescue of computer games salesman Gianluca Ardini, 29, was recorded in a video tweeted early on by the fire service, which has deployed hundreds of personnel to the scene.

Rescuers lowered him on ropes from his van, which was trapped in the remains of the bridge,external, some 20m above the ground, local news site Genova24 reports. He is now in hospital with an injured shoulder. His pregnant girlfriend, Giulia Organo, said she believed the thought of seeing his baby being born had given him the strength to cling on while firefighters worked to free him. Mr Ardini's travel companion, 35-year-old Luigi Matti Altadonna died in the bridge collapse. This video can not be played Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell narrowly escaped the Genoa bridge collapse with their two children Luciano Goccia was in the cabin of his pick-up truck in a car park when the shock wave from the collapsing bridge slammed into it. ""I had just arrived underneath the bridge,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I opened the truck door to get out and then I felt the roar. When I turned, I was thrown through the air and hit a wall and I lost my breath. The blast of air that had thrown me backwards saved my life."" Returning to the car park to look at the wreck of his vehicle, he said his escape had been ""more than miraculous"". His right arm in a sling,he said he was well but could not bring himself to look up at the broken bridge.,external Hundreds of emergency workers and firefighters are still there and speak of not giving up hope, although they accept there is very little chance anyone will now be found alive. The remains of the bridge loom over a residential area ""We are still looking for cavities that can hide people, living or not,"" fire official Emanuele Gissi told AFP news agency. Hundreds of people cannot return to their homes, particularly residents of council housing blocks that could be at risk from the collapse of another tower. The blocks may have to be destroyed when a new bridge is built. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Several people are listed as missing but officials are reluctant to link them with the accident as yet. Three Chileans, who lived in Italy, and four French nationals are among the dead. There will be a national day of mourning on Saturday to coincide with the funerals of victims. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has declared a state of emergency for the Liguria region, which includes Genoa, one of Italy's busiest ports. The Genoan Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into possible negligent homicide. Its lead prosecutor has blamed ""human error"". It is not yet clear. There was torrential rainfall at the time. Work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time, the motorway operator said. Autostrade per l'Italia added that in 2011 the bridge had suffered degradation due to heavy traffic. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio has threatened to take Autostrade per l'Italia's job into state control. ""It's not possible that someone pays a toll to die,"" he said. ""Those who were supposed to do the maintenance work did not do it properly. That bridge should have been closed before this tragedy happened."" Autostrade per l'Italia insists it has performed according to its contract and the law. It says checks were carried out quarterly by world-leading experts and had shown no cause for alarm. The Milan-based Atlantia, partly owned by the Benetton family, insisted the government would have to reimburse the value of the contract if it were revoked. What could have made the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A fuming Mr Di Maio said that ""while bodies were still being counted"" the company was speaking about money it would get from cancelled contracts. ""This is shameful, always thinking about profit,"" he said.

Michelle and Barack Obama paid tribute to Aretha Franklin in a statement released on Thursday. She performed at his 2009 inauguration ceremony, andfamously reduced the president to tears singing (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman in 2015. ""America has no royalty. But we do have a chance to earn something more enduring. Born in Memphis and raised in Detroit, Aretha Franklin grew up performing gospel songs in her father's congregation. For more than six decades since, every time she sang, we were all graced with a glimpse of the divine,"" the statement says. ""Through her compositions and unmatched musicianship, Aretha helped define the American experience.  In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade - our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect.

Five ways Aretha Franklin made history,"Aretha Franklin's music moved millions of people and sound-tracked social change over five decades With the death of Aretha Franklin, the world has lost perhaps the greatest singer of our age. Or if you share the view of music magazine Rolling Stone - simply the greatest of all time. It wasn't just her spine-tingling voice that made Franklin an icon, though. From her ties to the US civil rights movement to the surprising story behind her best-known hit, Respect - Aretha not only sold Soul: She was there as America shaped its own. Here are five ways Detroit's diva made history... It's hard to imagine, but Franklin's best-known song - the infectious call-to-arms Respect - didn't start off with her. Soul singer Otis Redding originally wrote and recorded it as a message from a hardworking man to his woman, with lines like, ""Hey, little girl, you're so sweeter than honey / And I'm about to give you all my money / But all I'm askin', hey / Is a little respect when I get home"". Franklin recorded her own version on Valentine's Day, 1967. Her twists included spelling out ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" (not present in the original), and deploying her sisters Carolyn and Erma as formidable backing singers. In her hands (and voice), the song went from a patriarchal plea to an anthem for women's rights. It swept to number 1 in the US charts and number 10 in the UK. Condoleezza Rice plays with Aretha Franklin Aretha's birthday serenade for Taylor Swift Two Grammy awards followed - and Otis Redding wasn't happy. ""He didn't like it,"" biographer Mark Ribowsky told NPR in 2015. But at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, Redding laughed as he declared, ""This next song is a song that a girl took away from me!"" ""He says it with the Otis charm, a little glint in the eye,"" Ribowsky suggests. ""And Otis couldn't begrudge her that."" Aretha pictured in 1968, soon after recording Respect Franklin explained why she re-versioned the song in 1999, telling NPR: ""Well, I heard Mr Redding's version of it. I just loved it. And I decided that I wanted to record it. ""My sister Carolyn and I got together. I was living in a small apartment on the West Side of Detroit. And - piano by the window, watching the cars go by - we came up with that infamous line, the 'sock it to me' line. It was a clichÃ© of the day... Some of the girls were saying that to the fellows, like, sock it to me in this way or sock it to me in that way. Nothing sexual, and it's not sexual. It was... just a clichÃ© line."" Franklin's father, the Rev C.L. Franklin, was a Baptist minister who organised the June 1963 Detroit Walk To Freedom - a massive march for racial equality. At the time, it was the largest civil rights demonstration in US history. Martin Luther King delivered an early version of his ""I Have a Dream speech"" there, two months before the great March on Washington that would cement it in history. Franklin, then in her early 20s, has said she was ""in awe of Dr King and listened carefully to every word that he said"". In 1967, Respect was picked up as a battle cry by the civil rights movement, and in February that year King presented Aretha with a leadership award. In 1968, she became only the second African-American woman to have appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Aretha (R) pictured in 1971 with her father, CL (born Clarence LaVaughn), and her sister, fellow singer Carolyn When King was shot dead, Franklin sang his favourite gospel song, Take My Hand, Precious Lord, at a memorial service. Soul legend Aretha Franklin retires from music Asked about the man she knew by Ebony magazine, Franklin said: ""He and my dad were great friends, and my dad from time to time, being the older gentleman, would counsel Dr King sometimes. I always had a great admiration for him and his sense of decency, and the justice that he wanted. ""He was a good man. Just a plain old good man, good person, and you can't help but admire that."" See more stories and videos like this Aretha performed at three US presidents' inauguration events - starting with a medley of Duke Ellington hits for Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1977. The next Democrat to take office, Bill Clinton in 1993, was graced by her stylings at a pre-inauguration festival two days before he was sworn in. Barack Obama was the lucky third in 2009, and the sizeable hat she wore to his inauguration made almost as many column inches as her performance. Franklin performing at Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration Franklin chose to sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee, an American patriotic song. Ever the perfectionist, she rued that the freezing temperatures had affected her voice. President Obama clearly wasn't bothered, and in 2015 was filmed wiping away tears at the Kennedy Center Honors, where Franklin sang (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman and brought the house down. Lady Soul racked up 20 Top 10 albums, a dozen million-selling singles and 18 Grammy awards during a five-decade recording career. So perhaps it's no surprise she was also the first woman to enter the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in 1987. The same year she scored her second number one hit, a duet with George Michael called I Knew You Were Waiting (for Me). Since the Hall of Fame has often been criticised for failing to honour female performers (almost 90% of its inductees are men), the fact she was first underscores the fact that Aretha is impossible to ignore - even in quarters where women are too often overlooked. Aretha Franklin's voice was officially declared a ""natural resource"" in 1985 by Michigan state's department of natural resources. But it's not the only way the state has found to immortalise her talent. In her native Detroit, the city council also named a street Aretha Franklin Way after her in 2017. The diva, then 75, thanked the city for ""this resplendent honour"" and vowed: ""Every time I drive or walk down it, I'm going to dance down it!""

Former India PM AB Vajpayee dies at 93,"Former Indian PM AB Vajpayee Former Indian prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has died aged 93. He was being treated for age-related illnesses in Delhi's AIIMS hospital. Vajpayee was one of the founding members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which currently governs India. Considered a giant of Indian politics, he served as prime minister three times between 1996 and 2004 and was instrumental in making India a global nuclear power. During his second stint as prime minister in 1998, he surprised the world by announcing that India had conducted a series of underground nuclear tests. AB Vajpayee at the BBC studio in Delhi It was the first time India had carried out nuclear tests since 1974. The experiments had taken place without any warning to the international community, which led to widespread outrage and concern. Obituary: Atal Behari Vajpayee But in India he was hailed as a hero, and it helped him bolster his image as a leader who was serious about national security and not afraid of international pressure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led condolences in a series of tweets, calling Mr Vajpayee's death a ""personal and irreplaceable loss."" Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's Vineet Khare who was at the AIIMS hospital when the news of Vajpayee's death was announced, says supporters carrying the former prime minster's pictures began gathering at the hospital and shouting slogans. ""He was a charismatic politicians who took pride in India and took everyone along. He will be missed,"" one of them said. Mr Vajpayee also tried to improve India's relationship with neighbouring Pakistan, which drew criticism from some Hindu nationalist groups. He boarded a bus to travel to the Pakistani city of Lahore in 1999 for a remarkable summit with Nawaz Sharif, who was then Pakistan's prime minister. The two men, both under immense pressure and politically weak, agreed to a number of confidence-building measures. But tensions with Pakistan intensified once again after the seizure of power by the Pakistani army under Gen Pervez Musharraf. Vajpayee was one of the founding members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which currently governs India And in December 1999, an Indian airliner was hijacked by Pakistani militants en route from Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, and Delhi and was flown to Afghanistan. There was anger that the Pakistani authorities had allowed the aircraft to land and refuel in Lahore. Mr Vajpayee was considered one of India's best orators, enabling him to connect with millions of Indians across class and caste divides. He was also a successful poet in the Hindi language and published a number of books.

Gun fears during mosque catapult attacks,"Armed police were deployed to Masjid Qamarul Islam in Small Heath Worshippers feared ""someone with a gun"" was attacking one of two mosques targeted with ball bearing catapults. Masjid Qamarul Islam, Birmingham, came under attack at 22:00 BST on Wednesday and Al-Hijrah mosque half-a-mile away was targeted 20 minutes later. It comes days after a man was arrested on suspicion of terror offences in London but police said the motive for the attacks on the mosques was unclear. Imam Usman Hussain said people were ""frightened"" as windows were smashed. West Midlands Police said the attacks were being treated as hate crimes and were thought to be linked. The Al-Hijrah mosque was also attacked during evening prayers Firearms officers were called to Masjid Qamarul Islam in Fosbrooke Road, Small Heath, and the Al-Hijrah mosque in Hob Moor Road as a precaution. The ball bearings recovered were thought to be from a heavy duty catapult, police said. Police said they were continuing to patrol the area to reassure worshippers and local residents. More stories from Midlands Live ""Worshippers thought they were under attack by someone with a gun,"" Mr Hussain from Masjid Qamarul Islam said. ""We heard a loud bang, people were very frightened, there was a sense of panic, but we don't know what the motive was."" Supt Tom Joyce said: ""The motives remain unclear and we are doing our utmost to discover who is responsible for these totally unacceptable incidents."" Nassar Mahmood said Muslims were facing ""unprecedented"" levels of Islamophobia Anthea McIntyre, co-founder of the campaign group West Midlands Together, said the attacks were an act of ""unreasoning hatred"". ""Happily the communities targeted showed admirable restraint and dignity, but that does not take away from the nastiness of the hate crime committed."" The attacks come after Nassar Mahmood, a trustee of Birmingham Central Mosque, said Muslims were facing ""unprecedented"" levels of Islamophobia. He made the statement after a29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terror offencesand attempted murder when a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday. Mr Mahmood urged the media not to speculate on any motive and added: ""We are shocked and saddened by this just the same as everybody else.""

Mosque sermon 'called for armed jihad'The mosque attended by the Manchester Arena bomber denies the claims about the sermon.UK,"This video can not be played Hear from the man who 'called for armed jihad' at Didsbury Mosque A sermon at the mosque where the Manchester bomber worshipped called for the support of armed jihadist fighters, according to two Muslim scholars. An imam at Didsbury Mosque in December 2016 was recorded praying for ""victory"" for ""our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq"". Scholars Usama Hasan and Shaykh Rehan said it referred to ""military jihad"". The imam, Mustafa Graf, says his sermon did not call for armed jihad and he has never preached radical Islam. The recording the BBC obtained is of Friday prayers at the mosque six months before Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb following an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in May 2017. Abedi and his family regularly attended the mosque and his father sometimes led the call to prayer. What is jihadism? The family's whereabouts on the day of the sermon are unknown but the BBC has been told that Abedi bought a ticket for the concert 10 days later. The bomb killed 22 people and the attacker, as well as injuring hundreds of others. It is also understood at least five men who have attended Didsbury Mosque have either travelled to Syria or have been jailed for terrorism offences. Greater Manchester Police said they had the BBC's material and were reviewing it ""to establish if any criminal offences have been committed"". Imam Mustafa Graf has denied ever preaching Islamic extremism The sermon, which was at a time of bombing in the Syrian city of Aleppo, includes prayers for ""mujahideen"" fighting abroad - a term commonly used for Islamist guerrilla fighters. ""We ask Allah to grant them mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory,"" Mr Graf is heard saying. Elsewhere it says: ""Lots of brothers stayed behind unfortunately. They love Islam and Muslims but they do nothing for the support of their brothers and sisters."" Another passage says: ""Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation."" Did MI5 miss bomber amid Navy rescue? What we know about Manchester bomber Manchester attack: The victims Mr Hasan, head of Islamic studies at Quilliam, a think tank that focuses on counter-extremism, said: ""From the context and the way these texts [the religious passages quoted within the sermon] are used they are clearly referring to military jihad, to armed jihad. ""I have known the Islamic discourse for pretty much 40 years, from being a child in this country and worldwide, and the mujahideen are the group fighting armed jihad."" Mr Rehan said he was in no doubt about what the sermon meant. ""The jihad he's referring to here is actually being on the battlefield, there's no ifs and no buts in this."" The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations. At one point Mr Graf is heard saying: ""The whole world, including Europe, America - what is the so-called civilised world - is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria. ""They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. ""Well in fact they helped the Russians and the Iranians and others, the militias, to kill Muslims over there."" The word ""jihad"" is widely used, though often inaccurately, by Western politicians and media. In Arabic, the word means ""effort"" or ""struggle"". In Islam, it could be an individual's internal struggle against baser instincts, the struggle to build a good Muslim society, or a war for the faith against unbelievers. Mr Rehan said: ""He's giving them the narrative of them against us. He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action."" Connections between the preacher and Salman Abedi have also been uncovered. The BBC has obtained footage of Abedi attending a demonstration in London against a secular Libyan general who was fighting against Islamist militia. The event was organised by the so-called 17th of February Forum protest group. Mr Graf is a leader of the group, although he was not present at the London demonstration. Mr Graf declined to be interviewed by the BBC but denied he had called for armed jihad or that he had ever preached Islamic extremism. The trustees of Didsbury Mosque also said the five men understood to have travelled to Syria or jailed for terrorism offences had not visited the mosque. In a statement it said Mr Graf's sermon was highlighting the plight of Syrians and his use of the words ""jihad"" and ""mujahideen"" had been misinterpreted. ""We do not tolerate or instigate any form of preaching that breaches both Islamic principles and the laws of England and Wales,"" it said.

Man called in bomb hoax to delay flightJacob Meir Abdellak rang police eight minutes before his flight was due to take off.London,"Jacob Meir Abdellak, from Hackney, called police eight minutes before his flight was due to take off A passenger who called in a bomb hoax in order to delay his flight has been jailed. Jacob Meir Abdellak rang police eight minutes before the plane was due to leave Gatwick Airport for Los Angeles on 11 May. The phone number used to make the call was the same one Abdellak used to book his flight, Sussex Police said. He admitted a false information charge at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday and was sentenced to 10 months. Abdellak, from Hackney in east London, made the anonymous call at 05:47 BST, delaying take-off by 90 minutes. Inquiries revealed the 47-year-old had been abusive towards airline employees when they did not allow him to board as a result of being late for the flight. He was told to return on another date to rearrange his flight, the force said. The librarian was arrested at Gatwick 11 days later on 22 May as he attempted to board another flight to the United States. The French national admitted the telephone number used to make the hoax call was his, but claimed he could not have made the call as he had lost the Sim card days earlier. Abdellak previously pleaded not guilty to the charge of communicating false information regarding a noxious substance. But he changed his plea on the day the trial was due to start and was ordered to pay a Â£140 victim surcharge as well as serving his jail term. Gatwick Police Ch Insp Marc Clothier said Abdellak's actions were ""ridiculous"". ""He was running late for his flight and thought it would be a good idea to call in a hoax bomb. This turned out to be the worst decision he could have made. ""His actions caused a level of fear and distress among a number of staff and passengers on board that flight.""

A-level results a surprise? We answer your questions,"Catherine Sezen (L), a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges and Helena Poole (R), editor of Which? University, are ready to answer your questions For those of you whose A-level results were not what you expected, we have experts ready to provide advice. There is still time to find a university place through clearing or perhaps opt for a completely different path into a career if your results were not what you needed - or maybe you have a decision to make if you managed to achieve better results than predicted. Cath Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Helena Poole, editor of Which? University, are on hand to offer personalised advice on what to do. Teenagers achieve rise in top A-level grades Why clearing is 'not the end of the world' What was new about this year's exams? I received a call from Leeds University medical school, who suggested that because my grades were higher than expected I should apply to them through clearing and drop my existing offer of a place to do biomedicine at Manchester. My teacher helped me verify that the call was genuine but when I rang Leeds they said my grades were not in fact high enough, which means I have now lost both places. What can I do? Oliver Hi Oliver, First of all well done on achieving such good grades. I would suggest that you contact Leeds University admissions and explain what you have explained here. Perhaps your teacher would be able to help you make the call. It would be helpful if you had the name of the caller and/or the time of the call. I would also suggest contacting Manchester and explaining what happened too. Don't panic, perhaps there has been a mix-up and it always pays to check again. I am sure you will find a place and will go on to do really well in your chosen career.Cath I'm sorry to hear this, especially since you've done better than expected and should be celebrating. This is very strange. You should get back in touch with Leeds, if necessary, someone higher up the pecking order, and explain the situation. It sounds like there has been a miscommunication somewhere and you've unfortunately caught the short end of the stick, especially since they contacted you and you have achieved their entry requirements. Verify what these are on Ucas or the uni's website. Do you have anything in writing, maybe an email, that illustrates what you were told on the phone, or the name, department or position of the person who spoke to you? This will be handy to have when you get in touch. With clearing calls, it's up to students to pick up the phone; but in this case, you may like to ask a parent or family member to phone on your behalf if you'd prefer, but stay close by if they want to speak to you. Also, get in touch with Manchester and explain the situation. Given that they originally accepted you, and the exceptional circumstances, we would hope they would understand the situation and offer your place back, although this may depend on numbers and places. For anyone achieving higher grades and contemplating choosing a different uni with higher entry grades, we would always recommend taking a step back and deciding if it's the best choice for you. Don't be swayed by a course just because it has higher entry grades, consider if it's ultimately right for you. We really hope this gets resolved and you can get back to celebrating soon.Helena My son was holding a place for Bristol on an offer of AAB. He achieved A*BB. Both amount to the same Ucas tariff points (136) but his offer to Bristol has been declined as he did not ""meet the exact terms of the offer"". So, does this mean if he'd got AAA, he would have been rejected? Of course not. The course is not in clearing but he was applying for a deferred place to 2019 in any event. Any suggestions? Robert First of all congratulations to your son.  A*BB is a good set of results.  I would suggest that you or your son contact Bristol again and explain he is looking for a deferred place for next year and find out what they would be able to offer for next year. Bristol is very competitive and they may require him to retake one of his A-levels. But if that is the course he wants, it might be the best solution.  On the other hand, there may well be another university that would have a course that would be right for your son. The results he has will stand him in good stead for success whether it is at Bristol or another university.Cath Sorry to hear that your son was not accepted to his first choice of uni. While it's frustrating because the Ucas points are the same, unfortunately some universities can get quite specific about achieving certain grades in certain subjects. That being said, if you haven't already, it might be worth him speaking to someone at Bristol to double check if there's any leeway. Since he's deferring his place, he can reapply to universities for 2019 with A*AB grades and could potentially secure a guaranteed offer because he already has his results. If he's dead set on this specific university and the grade requirements are the same in 2019, he has the option to resit some exams next year. It's also worth checking that the 2019 course grade requirements haven't changed from the 2018 ones.Helena I am currently abroad but according to Ucas Track I did not meet the grades for medicine or biomedical sciences at King's College London. I really want to study medicine and don't want to take a gap year, but maybe I should retake and reapply next year. Is it possibly to apply for medicine through clearing? Maham Hi Maham, You must be feeling a bit disappointed but there are options available to you. Clearing,externaldoesn't usually offer medicine courses but I'vehad a quick check of the live vacancies,externaland there are some medicine courses listed on there. If any of these interest you, you'll want to call up your school and check exactly what grades you got, to see if you meet the entry requirements for the clearing courses. Competitive courses can get snapped up quickly so try and move fast, but be sure to check the course is what you're looking for before jumping in and accepting an offer. If you go for this option you will need to phone the number on the clearing page and be ready to talk through why you want to study that course in particular. If you don't find anything you want, you may want to consider taking a Biomedical Science course through clearing and converting to medicine as a postgrad degree. If you decide Clearing is not for you, then retaking your exams may be an option but, because medicine is such a competitive degree, you should check with the universities you're interested in to see what their view is on retakes. We always recommend students are around when receiving their A-level results but, since you're abroad, you should definitely call up your school or college and chat through your options with them too.Helena I am sorry to hear you didn't get the grades you needed for your first choice course. If you are not sure of your results I would suggest the first step is to contact your school or college to confirm exactly what you got. There may be options through clearing, but take your time and make sure any places you are offered are what you really want. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the options available to you too, so I would suggest you start there.  I am sure you will find an option that's right for you.Cath My results are higher than expected. I had accepted a place at Teesside but now have the choice to go to a different university to do the same course. Would it be better to change? Melanie Hi Melanie, Well done on your results. Take a little time to think about your options.  You can have a look to see if there are any places available at other universitiesthrough the adjustment process.,externalLook through the opportunities available and talk it through with someone. Consider the pros and cons of your current option and any new options. Good luck! I am sure you will come to the best decision for you and your career plans.Cath Hi Melanie, Congratulations on achieving brilliant results. You have the option toapply for a new uni place through UCAS adjustment,externalbut whether you do this is entirely a personal decision. Just because you can, does not necessarily mean you should. Most likely you've already researched your confirmed choice of uni and visited it on an open day, so you have probably put a lot of thought into this course already. If you haven't gone into school, I would suggest going in and chatting through your options with a teacher or careers adviser.Research the new uni course,externalas much as you can and, if possible try to visit the university or city this weekend. Some unis will have open days the weekend after results day. Bear in mind you have five days from results day to use adjustment, so you have to act fairly quickly, but try not to panic and rush a decision where you're not fully informed. Best of luck!Helena All students in my son's class were projected As or Bs in music A-level but received Cs and Ds. Given that everyone failed to reach projected grades suggests that something is wrong somewhere. Is there a process available that would allow us to question the marking? Peter Hi Peter, I am sorry to hear that your son's result in music wasn't what he expected. Your son's school or college will be best placed to advise you on a review of marking. If all the results were not what they were expecting, they may already be looking at this. I hope that this result doesn't impact on your son's plans and wish him well for his future.Cath Your son should speak to his schoolabout appealing against his grade, based on the results he's achieved,externaland his future aspirations. Inquiries can take a few different forms, from a clerical recheck to access to scripts. The school will be able to pursue this further on his behalf, should appealing be deemed the best step forward.Helena Basically I have failed biology and chemistry. I heard I might be able to retake in November. Is this true? Umar, London Hello!  I am sorry to hear that your results didn't go the way you had planned.  I would suggest that you contact your school or college about retake opportunities. They will be best placed to advise on retaking your exams and on any other options available to you to help you achieve your career aims.Cath Sorry to hear you didn't get the results you were hoping for. If you haven't already, I would recommend going into your school or college and talking to your teachers or careers advisers. Under the new A-level system, retakes occur at the following May or June, but your school should be able to confirm this depending on their retakes policy. If you want to understand more about what options you have after failing an exam, take a look at our advice guide.Helena The exams were taken in May and June I have received my A-level results for biology, chemistry and maths and my grades are AAB instead of the A*A*A I had been predicted. I would really like to see my papers or order a review. What would you advise me to do? Abdi Sorry to hear you haven't got the results you wanted, but try not to panic. If you would like to appeal against any of your grades, you'll need to speak to your school about this. For example, a careers adviser or the head of your department or sixth form. They'll be able to discuss your options in light of your results to help you figure out the best next steps, and if necessary action an appeal for you. It's not something you can do on your own. Take a look at Which? University's full guide to appealing against an A-level grade,externalfor more information around this. In the meantime, see if there are any courses in clearing which meet the grades you have achieved. There may be a vacant spot at a uni for the same, or similar, course, that is right for you.Helena Hello! First of all well done! AAB are very good results. If you would like to see your papers or order a review I would suggest that you contact your school or college. They will be best placed to advise you on the next steps. In the meantime, good luck in your future plans.Cath I did not achieve my predicted A-level grades. I got BBC instead of ABB which I needed. So I didn't get into my first choice university. I have been accepted into my second choice for a foundation year but I am quite disappointed. I was wondering whether I could switch from foundation to a better university or if retaking one A-level, which is what I am most keen on, would be better. Tash Hi Tash, These are good results, so well done. Take time to consider your options. You might want to speak to a careers adviser at your school or college. They will be able to advise about the retake option. You can also look atopportunities through clearing.,externalGood luck and don't rush to make a decision.Cath The thing about making a university your first or insurance choice is that you're making a commitment to go there should you get the grades for it. However, that doesn't mean you'll be dragged, kicking and screaming, to take it. You'll need to contact your insurance choice and ask them to formally release you, so youcan enter clearing to find an alternative.,externalGet on the phone to them, with your Ucas ID, and have a cup of tea handy in case you need to wait on the line, and speak to them about it. Regarding retaking an A-level, it's best to discuss this with your school - for example, a careers adviser, or head of department or sixth form. They know you best and can properly advise you based on what grades you've achieved and what you're hoping to go on to do, plus they'll have been through this many times before and will have policies on resits in place.Helena A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades Why clearing 'is not the end of the world"" What was new about this year's A-levels?

Aretha Franklin: A life in pictures,"Aretha Franklin, the ""queen of soul"" whose career spanned seven decades, has died in Detroit at the age of 76. Here is a look back at her life and times in pictures. Born in Memphis in 1942, Aretha Louise Franklin made her first recording when she was just 14. But her career did not truly take off until she signed for Atlantic Records in 1966. She went on to have a string of hits, among them I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You), Respect and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. Here she is performing on Top of the Pops in 1968. Personal problems and an ill-advised foray into disco made for a less successful 1970s, though she continued to perform extensively. Here she is taking part in a 'Hollywood Salute' at the 1980 Royal Variety Performance. The same year saw her appear alongside John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in cult comedy The Blues Brothers. As volatile waitress Mrs Murphy, she got to sing her classic anthem Think, as well as a few lines from Jailhouse Rock. Franklin's career experienced an upturn in the 1980s, thanks in part to high-profile duets with, among others, the Eurythmics. Here she is in the studio with Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox recording Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves in 1985. This shot from January 1993 sees her joined by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross as they celebrate the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. This shot from 1997, meanwhile, shows her posing in New York with businessman Donald Trump, two decades before he himself was elected President of the United States. A new generation of singers came to see Franklin as an elder stateswoman of music. Here she is in 1998 with Mariah Carey at a ""Divas Live"" concert at New York's Beacon Theatre. Aretha's contribution to music was set in stone in 1987 when she became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Two decades years later she was back to pay tribute to Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records. Last November, at the age of 75, she gave her final performance at a gala in New York in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. Her nine-song set included a rendition of Say A Little Prayer.

'Miracle escape' stories emerge in GenoaA man was plucked from a van hanging in the wreckage of the bridge but his companion died.Europe,"This video can not be played Luciano Goccia: 'I was under the bridge when it collapsed' Hair-raising stories of narrow escapes from the Italian motorway bridge collapse have emerged, two days after the disaster in Genoa. A salesman was saved by firefighters after his falling van got caught in the wreckage of the bridge, while his companion plunged to his death. At least 38 people died and 15 were injured when the bridge fell. Between 10 and 20 people may still be missing under the rubble, Genoa's chief prosecutor has told reporters. Francesco Cozzi told Reuters news agency by telephone that this was the working hypothesis based on information from relatives who had not heard from family members and the number of vehicles thought to have been on the bridge when it went down. Dozens of vehicles dropped when a huge tower and a section of the Morandi bridge measuring about 200m (656ft) collapsed about 45m on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The Morandi, which was built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, Italy's main land corridor with France. Hundreds of people are unable to return to homes under the bridge Infrastructure across Italy will be double-checked in the aftermath of the disaster, the government has promised. The bridge's operator, Autostrade per l'Italia, is under mounting pressure from politicians and share traders, with the government threatening to terminate contracts and impose heavy fines. At one point in morning trading, shares in Autostrade's holding company, Atlantia, fell by as much as 25%. What we know so far The victims of the Genoa Bridge collapse Games off after Genoa bridge disaster The daring rescue of computer games salesman Gianluca Ardini, 29, was recorded in a video tweeted early on by the fire service, which has deployed hundreds of personnel to the scene.

Rescuers lowered him on ropes from his van, which was trapped in the remains of the bridge,external, some 20m above the ground, local news site Genova24 reports. He is now in hospital with an injured shoulder. His pregnant girlfriend, Giulia Organo, said she believed the thought of seeing his baby being born had given him the strength to cling on while firefighters worked to free him. Mr Ardini's travel companion, 35-year-old Luigi Matti Altadonna died in the bridge collapse. This video can not be played Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell narrowly escaped the Genoa bridge collapse with their two children Luciano Goccia was in the cabin of his pick-up truck in a car park when the shock wave from the collapsing bridge slammed into it. ""I had just arrived underneath the bridge,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I opened the truck door to get out and then I felt the roar. When I turned, I was thrown through the air and hit a wall and I lost my breath. The blast of air that had thrown me backwards saved my life."" Returning to the car park to look at the wreck of his vehicle, he said his escape had been ""more than miraculous"". His right arm in a sling,he said he was well but could not bring himself to look up at the broken bridge.,external Hundreds of emergency workers and firefighters are still there and speak of not giving up hope, although they accept there is very little chance anyone will now be found alive. The remains of the bridge loom over a residential area ""We are still looking for cavities that can hide people, living or not,"" fire official Emanuele Gissi told AFP news agency. Hundreds of people cannot return to their homes, particularly residents of council housing blocks that could be at risk from the collapse of another tower. The blocks may have to be destroyed when a new bridge is built. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Several people are listed as missing but officials are reluctant to link them with the accident as yet. Three Chileans, who lived in Italy, and four French nationals are among the dead. There will be a national day of mourning on Saturday to coincide with the funerals of victims. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has declared a state of emergency for the Liguria region, which includes Genoa, one of Italy's busiest ports. The Genoan Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into possible negligent homicide. Its lead prosecutor has blamed ""human error"". It is not yet clear. There was torrential rainfall at the time. Work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time, the motorway operator said. Autostrade per l'Italia added that in 2011 the bridge had suffered degradation due to heavy traffic. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio has threatened to take Autostrade per l'Italia's job into state control. ""It's not possible that someone pays a toll to die,"" he said. ""Those who were supposed to do the maintenance work did not do it properly. That bridge should have been closed before this tragedy happened."" Autostrade per l'Italia insists it has performed according to its contract and the law. It says checks were carried out quarterly by world-leading experts and had shown no cause for alarm. The Milan-based Atlantia, partly owned by the Benetton family, insisted the government would have to reimburse the value of the contract if it were revoked. What could have made the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A fuming Mr Di Maio said that ""while bodies were still being counted"" the company was speaking about money it would get from cancelled contracts.

How did vanilla become more expensive than silver?," A barefoot farmer is making his way through a forest. Quiet drops of rain tumble steadily through the night, picked out in the light from his torch. The rusty machete he holds isn’t for cutting down vines or chopping away stubborn branches - it is a defence against thieves. Lots of other men - farmers like him - are out in the rain, patrolling the forest. For the past three months, they have left their homes every night and made the long journey into the plantations to protect their crop. But this is not an illegal coca plantation, or anything like it. In fact, these farmers are growing a crop whose name is a byword for something boring. The men need weapons to guard against robbers who roam the countryside looking for one thing - Madagascan vanilla. They show that these vanilla vines belong to Leon Charles. That’s my name. My nickname - people here call me Baba.” Leon is with his wife, Oristin, in their garden, where they grow coffee and vanilla in the village of Ambanizana, at the edge of the Masoala National Park, in the north-east corner of Madagascar. It’s a hard place to get to - there are no roads to speak of. From the island’s capital, Antananarivo, it takes two flights, two hours on a speedboat and another 30 minutes in a canoe to reach Ambanizana. The island of Madagascar is the world's largest producer of vanilla beans The village is full of music. Upbeat dance melodies blare through the sheer, pink curtain covering the doorway of Leon’s home - a rectangular, wooden structure with a peaked roof. Here, the forest meets the sea and the high humidity, shade, and moderate temperatures make it perfect for growing vanilla. Each vine that Leon prunes holds pods - also known as beans - that will eventually retail for more than $150 (£120), once they are dried. To deter theft, all the farmers in the surrounding area are stamping their names, or sometimes serial numbers, on to individual pods while they’re still on the vine. Even when the pods are dried, the markings can be made out. Leon was robbed before last year’s harvest - and it was devastating for his family. “I was working in my [nearby] rice field when they quickly took advantage in order to steal,” he says. “I was so sad, I even cried, because we lost everything. I didn’t have money to send the children to school.  Our household has been experiencing hardship for a whole year.” But it could have been even worse. The robberies are often violent. There have been dozens of murders in Madagascar linked to vanilla. Several communities have tried and failed to get protection from armed police. Some have taken the law into their own hands. Villagers say in a nearby village, a machete-wielding crowd descended on five suspected gangsters - hacking and stabbing them to death. The killings have yet to be solved by the police. Locals say there is no will or capacity in the police forces to investigate the vanilla thefts - or the mob justice that sometimes follows. The chief of Leon’s village fears the same thing could happen there. A youngish-looking man, Chief Oreis is wearing shorts and sandals with a bright purple shirt when he stops by Leon’s house to say hello. His expression grows stern when he talks about the vanilla thefts. “We have to do our best to make sure thieves are not able to steal from us here,” he says. “Because if someone’s livelihood is taken away, they can do anything, even kill.” Thousands of miles away in London, Oddono’s ice cream shop is tucked between a pizza parlour and a cafe on a busy street in South Kensington. There’s a plethora of awards on one wall. The owners boast of the finest natural ingredients in their authentic Italian gelato: Valrhona chocolate from France, pistachios from Sicily, hazelnuts from Piedmont. But last year, one variety of ice cream was missing. “When I told customers that we didn’t have any vanilla ice cream, many of them were shocked,” says Christian Oddono, who manages the shop. “I had to explain that we didn’t want to give them bad quality products but also we were never going to use chemicals. Then, they understood.” The price for last year’s Madagascan vanilla crop was sky high, but Christian found the quality of what he was getting so low that he took vanilla ice cream off his menu. “The pods had too much moisture in them and some even had a mouldy smell - a sign that the curing process wasn’t done properly,” he says. “This year I found another, better supplier in Madagascar. The prices are still high, so we’ve had to raise our prices as well, but our customers haven’t complained. We see a general trend of more customers wanting to eat more authentic food and shying away from chemicals and lab-produced substitutes.” Thousands of miles away in London, Oddono’s ice cream shop is tucked between a pizza parlour and a cafe on a busy street in South Kensington.

But if you’re eating something vanilla-flavoured or smelling something vanilla-scented - it’s probably artificial. Scientists have been making synthetic vanillin - the compound that gives vanilla its aroma - since the 19th Century. It has been extracted from coal, tar, rice bran, wood pulp and even cow dung. Today, the vast majority ofsynthetic vanillincomes from petrochemicals. It can be20 times cheaperthan the real thing. The burgeoning interest in “artisanal” food made in a traditional way explains some of the demand for natural vanilla. But much of the rocketing price can be put down to food rules on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe and the United States, ice cream labelled “vanilla” must contain natural vanillin extract from vanilla pods. If the flavour comes wholly or partly from artificial sources, the packaging must say “vanilla flavour” or “artificial vanilla”. Vanilla from vanilla pods will have a taste and potency unique to the area in which it is grown, much like wine. The vanilla from Madagascar has a distinct rummy taste and sweet aroma, which is why ice-cream makers choose it over vanilla from other countries. And there is more and more pressure on food companies to switch from artificial vanilla to vanilla beans.  Big corporations such as Hershey and Nestle have started buying natural vanilla extract for their products in large quantities, which injects more demand into the limited supply chain and raises prices further.

Much of the selecting and grading is done by women The vanilla orchid is native to Mexico but it is only a minor producer, having been overtaken by Madagascar in the 1960s. Indonesia is the other big producer. French colonists first brought vanilla to Madagascar’s neighbouring island of Réunion in the early 19th Century. It grows as a clinging vine, reaching lengths of up to 300ft (90m). The vines grow well outside Mexico - but no fruit, in the form of vanilla beans, was produced. Horticulturists eventually discovered what was missing. The pollen on a vanilla orchid flower is inaccessible to most insects, including typical honey bees. The small Melipona bee, which lives in only Mexico, was the only one able to reach the vanilla pollen and fertilise the flowers. Still, relying on the bees for pollination is a hit-and-miss affair as the pale white orchids bloom for just one day each year and the flower is fertile for only eight to 12 hours after it blooms. On Réunion, an enslaved boy named Edmond Albius invented a painstaking way of pollinating by hand. A sharp, thin stick is used to lift the fragile membrane between the male and female parts of the flower, which are then pushed into each other for pollination to occur. This has to be done for every single flower on every vine in order to produce the fruit - vanilla pods filled with thousands of the tiny black seeds we eventually see in high-quality vanilla ice cream. Madagascan farmers have to check their plants every morning. If a farmer misses the fertilisation window for a flower, or damages the plant, he loses out on precious pods - it takes about 600 blossoms pollinated by hand to produce just 1kg of cured vanilla beans. After pollination, it takes nine months for the vanilla pods to mature - then, they are harvested. The still-green beans start to ferment quickly, so buyers must be found fast.  Small farmers typically sell green pods to middlemen who gather large amounts to sell on to local exporters. At this point, the pods do not have the characteristic vanilla smell or taste. The laborious  journey - from pollination to curing and drying, and then preparing for export - takes about a year. The green beans are immersed in boiling water to stop the fermentation process The finished product is a brownish-black, heavily wrinkled vanilla bean that is soft, supple and leathery to the touch, with a strong aroma. On a dusty street in the middle of the market town of Maroantsetra, I am trying to do a deal. This year’s harvest won’t come in for several more weeks -  but the dealers here in the “grey market” may have some to sell. One “commissionaire” - a middleman - I spoke to nearer to the villages had only 300g (10oz) of the stuff and told me quite honestly: “This is not good quality.” But the group of men sitting under the shade of a row of small shops have managed to produce some, after a long wait. The goods are delivered on a bright green motorbike. The rider wears gold rings and his necklace catches the light as he pulls me aside to reveal the package. The dealer weighs the vacuum-packed pods “This is 2kg,” the dealer tells me proudly, “3.3 million ariary.” That’s $1,000. I tell him I can’t afford to buy it. He shrugs and smiles but he is not disappointed - there will be other more serious buyers. The heavy package is not drugs. Through the clear plastic pouch, coated in a light film of dust, I can see dark, moist vanilla beans. They are vacuum-sealed - a practice that the government is banning because it plays a part in reducing the quality of the bean that Madagascar is so well known for. Vanilla is often vacuum-packed so it can be stored for months after the harvest The process can be used by speculators to preserve pods that have been harvested too early. They often store them to sell later at higher prices. But immature or improperly cured beans have a lower vanillin content and often a mouldy taste. Many farmers choose to pick their pods early themselves to avoid losing everything to thieves in the last months before the harvest. The government has tried to stop this by setting fixed harvest dates for each village. To hammer the message home, the authorities recently burned 500kg of prematurely picked pods in public. But there are smaller middlemen who are under immense pressure to get their beans early - and at a lower price. They get cash advances from big exporters - but they must deliver. Waiting until harvest time, when demand exceeds supply, can be risky. Arman Ramarokootonirina has been working as a middleman buying up vanilla from farmers in Maroantsetra for more than seven years. Commissionaire Arman Ramarokootonirina There are many unscrupulous new entrants into the industry, he says. It is now flush with cash. “It is the greed of the big bosses that is causing the problem. People get big advances yet they haven’t even planted any vanilla. Then they have to steal it from other people’s gardens to fulfill the orders.” But for the growers who are able to protect their crops, the high vanilla prices mean one good harvest can be life-changing. A kilogram of cured beans is worth $400-$500 - a hefty sum in a country where the average annual per capita income is $1,500. In the village of Ambanizana, you can see the vanilla money at work. Parents are able to send their children to bigger, better schools outside the village. Modern brick houses are springing up where traditional wooden houses once stood. There is a big construction site at the edge of the village. The foreman reveals they are building a disco and restaurant, the first of its kind in Ambanizana. The owner of the project is a “vanillionaire” - he has made his money both as a vanilla grower and as a commissionaire. The farmers may be making more money than before - but their small plots of land produce limited amounts of vanilla. It is the middlemen and the exporters who are raking in the big money. The inaccessibility of the vanilla-growing regions means they are an essential part of the supply chain. Commissionaires travel around the villages, buying up large quantities of green vanilla pods to sell on to big exporting companies who cure and ship them around the world. The grandest building in Maroantsetra is the headquarters of one of these exporters. Painted pristine white with dark green trim, it’s a striking contrast to the wooden houses on either side.Up to four tonnes of vanilla are exported from here every year. Security cameras line the path to the large warehouse at the back of the complex. There are big padlocks on the gates and iron bars criss-cross the windows. Exporter Sylvan Chen's headquarters in Maroantsetra Sylvan Chen runs the place. They pat down the staff at the end of each day to make sure no vanilla is being smuggled out in bags, shoes or underwear. It’s not vanilla season yet, so the women on the lower floor of the warehouse now are sifting cloves - another spice exported from Madagascar, nowhere near as lucrative as vanilla. The upper floor is where the vanilla will be stored while it’s being dried. The space is packed to the rafters with cheap foam mattresses. Sylvan sold 2,000 of them last year to farmers, who prefer them to sleeping on traditional woven mats. They’re often handing back the cash Sylvan has just given them for their vanilla. Many farmers also grow cloves for export Exporter Sylvan Chen Times are good for the industry, now that the price of vanilla is so high, Sylvan acknowledges. But there is a fear that short-term gains will cause long-term damage to the quality and reputation of Madagascan vanilla. “Madagascar’s vanilla is too expensive and people could turn to other countries which are equipped with quality standards. The vanilla sector here may no longer have a future if the quality doesn’t improve”. In a speedboat cruising down the coast at the edge of Masoala National park, I see bare patches of land breaking up the lush green forest like an ugly rash. Park ranger Armand Marozafy and environmental activist Clovis Razafimalala say this is the price this park has paid since vanilla prices began to soar. From the water, they point out more parts of the forest coastline that have been burnt down so that crops  - mainly vanilla - can be planted. Park ranger Armand Marozafy Inside the forest, home to endangered lemurs, it becomes even clearer what is at stake. Densely packed trees and unyielding vines suddenly give way to a clearing. Saplings have sprung up between charred stumps of ancient trees. The trees that were chopped down were more than 100 years old. The clearing is not very big, but as Armand explains, the problem is that there are patches like this all over the place. Trees and forest that are cut down cannot grow back the same way again - it would take hundreds of years. When this sort of damage occurs, a fragile ecosystem is disrupted. Lemurs will no longer have food here. Plants, insects and animals that relied on a delicate balance start to disappear. People in Madagascar are worried about its vanilla losing its reputation - but in the national park a fragile ecosystem is being badly damaged to cater for global demand. It is short-sightedness. As trees start to disappear, the unique conditions that make this a perfect place to grow vanilla will start to disappear as well. The forests provide the right amount of rainfall, humidity and soil to grow Madagascar’s coveted brand of vanilla. Cutting down forest to grow more vanilla will eventually make it harder to grow quality vanilla on the island. The industry will have to find ways to ensure consistent quality in order to prevent buyers from looking elsewhere. Francois Ravelonjara, a vanilla farmer in Maroansetra, wears an air of resignation as he stamps a serial number on to vanilla pods in his small farm. Farmer Francois Ravelonjara The number corresponds to one in his carte de planteur de vanille, a registration document distributed to vanilla growers by the government to prove ownership and curb theft. The markings have not prevented thieves from raiding his plot twice already. It would be better if the prices went down again,” he says. “We didn’t make much - but at least we did not live in fear.” Many long-term growers and traders echo that sentiment. Much like the blooming of the vanilla orchid flower, they know the current boom will not last very long. But the effects of it will. Built with Shorthand"
Obituary: Aretha FranklinShe possessed one of the most distinctive and influential voices in the history of popular music.,"Aretha Franklin possessed one of the most distinctive and influential voices in the history of popular music. In a 50-year recording career she racked up 20 Top 10 albums, a dozen million-selling singles and earned no fewer than 18 Grammy awards. An artist of immense versatility, her powerful voice, trained in the gospel tradition, moved on to embrace jazz, soul and rhythm and blues. The influential Rolling Stone magazine rated her as the greatest singer of all time. Aretha Franklin in 1967, the year she released her album I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You Aretha Louise Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on 25 March 1942. She was the daughter of CL Franklin, a Baptist minister, and his wife Barbara, an accomplished gospel singer. By the time she was six, she and her family had moved to Detroit. There the young Franklin learned to play the piano and began singing in her father's church. Her father's serial infidelities finally saw the break-up of her parents' marriage. Her mother left the family home and moved to Buffalo, New York, where she died from a heart attack aged 34. Her father became a respected figure among Detroit's black community, and his church a centre for gospel music. The young Franklin came into contact with a number of musicians, including Smokey Robinson and Sam Cooke. Encouraged by her father she made her first recording, the album Songs of Faith, when she was just 14, by which time she had already given birth to her first son, Clarence. She had a second child, Edward, when she was 16, but was able to maintain her singing career when her grandmother offered to raise the two boys. By now her talent was reaching a wider audience. Producer Berry Gordy tried to sign the young Franklin to his new Motown record label, but her father turned down the offer. Sam Cooke tried to persuade her to sign with his label, RCA. But she had already been spotted by one of Columbia's talent scouts, and that was the label on which she first entered the R&B charts in 1960 with Today I Sing the Blues. Listen to Aretha Franklin tracks (BBC Music) While she had two further R&B hits with Columbia, she only managed to scrape into the mainstream US Top 40 once, with Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody. But Columbia failed to exploit the potential of her gospel voice, and their insistence that she record girl group-style pop, such as The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss), saw Franklin move over to Atlantic Records in 1966. Her first recording on the new label, I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You), proved to be her breakthrough, going to number one in the rhythm and blues charts and reaching number nine in the pop charts. Her second Atlantic single became her best known song. Originally written and recorded by Otis Redding, her gospel-tinged rendition of Respect went to number one in the US charts and reached number 10 in the UK. The song, on which she was backed by her sisters Carolyn and Erma, became an anthem for the feminist movement in the United States and won Franklin two Grammy awards. Aretha Franklin in 1967 Franklin also became an icon for the US civil rights movement. Now dubbed, ""Lady Soul"", she was presented with an award by Martin Luther King and became only the second African-American woman to appear on the cover of Time magazine. She had three more US Top 10 hits in 1967, including the Carole King/Gerry Goffin single (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. King later featured the song on her groundbreaking 1971 album Tapestry. At a recording session in New York in 1969 By this time her seven year-long marriage to her manager, Ted White, who had also co-written many of her songs, was breaking down and Franklin was experiencing difficulties in following up her early run of Atlantic hits. There were rumours she had begun drinking heavily and, in 1969, she was arrested for disorderly conduct. Meanwhile, her father had hosted a controversial conference for a black separatist group that ended in a violent confrontation with Detroit police. It left one officer dead and several other people wounded. While she continued to churn out hits, such as Don't Play That Song, Call Me, Bridge Over Troubled Water and Spanish Harlem, she was becoming increasingly disillusioned with Atlantic, who were grooming a new star, Roberta Flack, for stardom. Franklin won no fewer than 18 Grammy awards The 1978 album Diva, an ill-advised attempt to cash in on the craze for disco, was a commercial flop and became her last recording for Atlantic. A year later her father was shot during a burglary at his Detroit home, an event which left him in a coma until his death in 1984. Franklin's behaviour was giving cause for concern, and she had to cut down on her touring after developing a phobia of flying. Yet her appearance in 1980 film The Blues Brothers gave her career the lift it needed, and a recording contract with Arista that saw her return to the charts with the album Jump to It. Its title track became her first US Top 40 hit in six years. Aretha Franklin with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on the Blues Brothers set Follow-up album Who's Zoomin' Who?, a mixture of pop, rock and dance, became Franklin's first ever platinum-certified album. Released in 1985, it contained hit singles Freeway of Love, the title track and Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves, a Top 20 duet with the Eurythmics. Her next album, Aretha, continued to build on her success and included the hits Jimmy Lee and a version of Jumpin' Jack Flash, produced by and featuring Keith Richards, as well as her Grammy-winning duet with George Michael, I Knew You Were Waiting (for Me). Aretha Franklin with Whoopi Goldberg, who starred in the 1986 film Jumpin' Jack Flash But her career again hit a plateau. She made a return to gospel with the album One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which received much critical praise, and a Grammy award, but failed to trouble the charts. The follow-up, Through the Storm, also failed to make an impression, despite a duet with Elton John which did get into the singles charts. In 1987 Franklin became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, while in 1994 she received a Grammy award for lifetime achievement. But her career had stagnated. She continued to record, without great success, and reprised her role as the owner of a restaurant in the film Blues Brothers 2000, for which she recorded a new version of Respect. Franklin set up her own label, Aretha Records, in 2003, but failed to release any albums on it. This was despite her announcement in 2006 that new tracks had already been recorded for a project entitled A Woman Falling Out of Love. In 2009 she sang the American patriotic song My Country, 'Tis of Thee at the inauguration ceremony of newly-elected US president Barack Obama. Her hat, adorned with a huge bow, caused a considerable amount of press comment. Performing at Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009 Following an operation in 2011 she struggled with health issues and cancelled a number of concerts. But in 2013 she returned to live performances with a concert in Detroit which launched a major tour. Franklin's own philosophy probably sums up why, despite the ups and downs of her career, she became such an enduring talent. ""Being a singer is a natural gift. It means I'm using to the highest degree possible the gift that God gave me to use. I'm happy with that.""

Italy bridge collapse firm under attackThreats to cancel contracts and impose fines send shares plummeting in the Italian company.Europe,"This video can not be played Luciano Goccia: 'I was under the bridge when it collapsed' Hair-raising stories of narrow escapes from the Italian motorway bridge collapse have emerged, two days after the disaster in Genoa. A salesman was saved by firefighters after his falling van got caught in the wreckage of the bridge, while his companion plunged to his death. At least 38 people died and 15 were injured when the bridge fell. Between 10 and 20 people may still be missing under the rubble, Genoa's chief prosecutor has told reporters. Francesco Cozzi told Reuters news agency by telephone that this was the working hypothesis based on information from relatives who had not heard from family members and the number of vehicles thought to have been on the bridge when it went down. Dozens of vehicles dropped when a huge tower and a section of the Morandi bridge measuring about 200m (656ft) collapsed about 45m on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The Morandi, which was built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, Italy's main land corridor with France. Hundreds of people are unable to return to homes under the bridge Infrastructure across Italy will be double-checked in the aftermath of the disaster, the government has promised. The bridge's operator, Autostrade per l'Italia, is under mounting pressure from politicians and share traders, with the government threatening to terminate contracts and impose heavy fines. At one point in morning trading, shares in Autostrade's holding company, Atlantia, fell by as much as 25%.

Stormzy sending black students to Cambridge,"Stormzy with his old teachers from Harris Academy in Crystal Palace Stormzy has announced that he will fund two black British students to go to the University of Cambridge. The Stormzy Scholarship will pay for tuition fees and provide a maintenance grant for up to four years of an undergraduate course. The rapper says: ""It's so important for black students, especially, to be aware that it can 100% be an option to attend a university of this calibre."" The rapper will fund two students this year and two in 2019. Stormzy with Cambridge University students Explaining why he set up the scholarship, Stormzy tells Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""In school and college I had the ability and was almost destined to go to one of the top universities. ""But that didn't happen for myself... so hopefully there's another young black student out there that can have that opportunity through my scholarship."" He adds: ""I always said that there's a whole bunch of academically brilliant, excellent students who also need an incentive."" This video can not be played A picture of 14 black male students at Cambridge went viral last year Cambridge has been criticised for not admitting many pupils from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. In June, the universityasked for helpfrom schools and parents to increase the number of black British students it enrols. It was after the Financial Times found that some Cambridge colleges didn't take in any black students from 2012 to 2016. The university says that it admitted 58 black students on to undergraduate courses in 2017. ""We're going to have young black students who are academically brilliant and smashing it, and they should just have that opportunity to walk into a university like Cambridge,"" says Stormzy. Stormzy says he wants to help students ""pursue their dream"" of studying at Cambridge The 25-year-old announced the scheme at his old school Harris City Academy in south London on A-level results day. He didn't go to university, but did get six A*s, three As and three Bs at GCSE. ""It sounds corny coming from a rapper, but I did love learning and I loved studying so I enjoyed that side of things,"" he says. ""But also, I made some of the best friends of my life at school, and so many memories."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I'm definitely going to apply for the scholarship because it seems like something that students who struggle with their financial situation at university may really benefit from, especially if they come form background similar to mine."" She thinks that black students are less likely to apply for universities like Cambridge because ""they see it like a really distant, alien place that they would not really thrive in"".

Soul legend Aretha Franklin to retire,"The star's biggest albums include Lady Soul and I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You Soul legend Aretha Franklin says she plans to retire from music to spend more time with her grandchildren. The 74-year-old said she would record one final album with Stevie Wonder before stepping out of the limelight. ""I must tell you, I am retiring this year,"" the Queen Of Soul told a Detroit TV station, adding that she felt ""exuberant"" about her plans. One of the most distinctive voices in popular music, she is known for hits including Respect and Dr Feelgood. Among her career highlights are: More than 20 number one singles in the US First woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Won the Grammy for best R&B vocal performance for eight consecutive years from 1968 to 1975 Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in 2005 Franklin is also an accomplished pianist Franklin has been performing since she was 19, but has been suffering from ill health in recent years. In 2010, she had to put her career on hold following abdominal surgery and has since slowed down her once-prolific tour schedule. Looking back on her success, the star said: ""I feel very enriched and satisfied with respect to where my career came from and where it is now"". There is a caveat to her retirement plans: The singer said she would remain open to ""some select things, many one a month, for six months out of the year"". ""I'll be pretty much satisfied, but I'm not going to go anywhere and just sit down and do nothing,"" she added. ""That wouldn't be good either."" The star has suffered from ill health in recent years Born in Memphis to a famous Baptist preacher, Franklin was tutored from an early age by gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. She struggled to find fame in the early years, with record label Columbia unsure how to frame her impressively powerful voice. A move to Atlantic Records in 1966 turned things around. Producer Jerry Wexler paired her with the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who prompted some of her most soulful, fiery performances. By 1968, she was renowned throughout America and Europe as ""Lady Soul"" - a symbol of black pride, who was presented an award by Martin Luther King, and appeared on the cover of Time. Although she faltered in the era of disco, an appearance in cult comedy The Blues Brothers brought her back into the public eye and she scored a number of big hits in the 1980s, including Who's Zooming Who? and the George Michael duet, I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me). She has continued to record and perform since, and two years ago, the starreduced President Obama to tears,externalwhen she performed (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman at the Kennedy Center Honours ceremony.

Her candid responses were refreshing and spoke volumes about her experience as a big star in the global media spotlight."" Analysis from Mark Savage, BBC music reporter Aretha Franklin's music moved millions of people and sound-tracked social change over five decades Nobody could inhabit a song like Aretha Franklin. You only have to compare Otis Redding's original recording of Respect to Aretha's version to hear it. His is superb. Hers is otherworldly. Even her most thunderous performances retained their humanity - something her shoutier disciples often overlooked. Five ways Aretha Franklin made history The desolate colours she painted onto the verses of Carole King's (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman made the release of the chorus even more joyous. In later years, she was let down by the material she chose (or which was chosen for her) but her performances still had the poetry and power to move audiences - including, notably, Barack Obama - to tears.

Worried about your results?,"Catherine Sezen (L), a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges and Helena Poole (R), editor of Which? University, are ready to answer your questions For those of you whose A-level results were not what you expected, we have experts ready to provide advice. There is still time to find a university place through clearing or perhaps opt for a completely different path into a career if your results were not what you needed - or maybe you have a decision to make if you managed to achieve better results than predicted. Cath Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Helena Poole, editor of Which? University, are on hand to offer personalised advice on what to do. Teenagers achieve rise in top A-level grades Why clearing is 'not the end of the world' What was new about this year's exams? I received a call from Leeds University medical school, who suggested that because my grades were higher than expected I should apply to them through clearing and drop my existing offer of a place to do biomedicine at Manchester. My teacher helped me verify that the call was genuine but when I rang Leeds they said my grades were not in fact high enough, which means I have now lost both places. What can I do? Oliver Hi Oliver, First of all well done on achieving such good grades. I would suggest that you contact Leeds University admissions and explain what you have explained here. Perhaps your teacher would be able to help you make the call. It would be helpful if you had the name of the caller and/or the time of the call. I would also suggest contacting Manchester and explaining what happened too. Don't panic, perhaps there has been a mix-up and it always pays to check again. I am sure you will find a place and will go on to do really well in your chosen career.Cath I'm sorry to hear this, especially since you've done better than expected and should be celebrating. This is very strange. You should get back in touch with Leeds, if necessary, someone higher up the pecking order, and explain the situation. It sounds like there has been a miscommunication somewhere and you've unfortunately caught the short end of the stick, especially since they contacted you and you have achieved their entry requirements. Verify what these are on Ucas or the uni's website. Do you have anything in writing, maybe an email, that illustrates what you were told on the phone, or the name, department or position of the person who spoke to you? This will be handy to have when you get in touch. With clearing calls, it's up to students to pick up the phone; but in this case, you may like to ask a parent or family member to phone on your behalf if you'd prefer, but stay close by if they want to speak to you. Also, get in touch with Manchester and explain the situation. Given that they originally accepted you, and the exceptional circumstances, we would hope they would understand the situation and offer your place back, although this may depend on numbers and places. For anyone achieving higher grades and contemplating choosing a different uni with higher entry grades, we would always recommend taking a step back and deciding if it's the best choice for you. Don't be swayed by a course just because it has higher entry grades, consider if it's ultimately right for you. We really hope this gets resolved and you can get back to celebrating soon.Helena My son was holding a place for Bristol on an offer of AAB. He achieved A*BB. Both amount to the same Ucas tariff points (136) but his offer to Bristol has been declined as he did not ""meet the exact terms of the offer"". So, does this mean if he'd got AAA, he would have been rejected? Of course not. The course is not in clearing but he was applying for a deferred place to 2019 in any event. Any suggestions? Robert First of all congratulations to your son.  A*BB is a good set of results.  I would suggest that you or your son contact Bristol again and explain he is looking for a deferred place for next year and find out what they would be able to offer for next year. Bristol is very competitive and they may require him to retake one of his A-levels. But if that is the course he wants, it might be the best solution.  On the other hand, there may well be another university that would have a course that would be right for your son. The results he has will stand him in good stead for success whether it is at Bristol or another university.Cath Sorry to hear that your son was not accepted to his first choice of uni. While it's frustrating because the Ucas points are the same, unfortunately some universities can get quite specific about achieving certain grades in certain subjects. That being said, if you haven't already, it might be worth him speaking to someone at Bristol to double check if there's any leeway. Since he's deferring his place, he can reapply to universities for 2019 with A*AB grades and could potentially secure a guaranteed offer because he already has his results. If he's dead set on this specific university and the grade requirements are the same in 2019, he has the option to resit some exams next year. It's also worth checking that the 2019 course grade requirements haven't changed from the 2018 ones.Helena I am currently abroad but according to Ucas Track I did not meet the grades for medicine or biomedical sciences at King's College London. I really want to study medicine and don't want to take a gap year, but maybe I should retake and reapply next year. Is it possibly to apply for medicine through clearing? Maham Hi Maham, You must be feeling a bit disappointed but there are options available to you. Clearing,externaldoesn't usually offer medicine courses but I'vehad a quick check of the live vacancies,externaland there are some medicine courses listed on there. If any of these interest you, you'll want to call up your school and check exactly what grades you got, to see if you meet the entry requirements for the clearing courses. Competitive courses can get snapped up quickly so try and move fast, but be sure to check the course is what you're looking for before jumping in and accepting an offer. If you go for this option you will need to phone the number on the clearing page and be ready to talk through why you want to study that course in particular. If you don't find anything you want, you may want to consider taking a Biomedical Science course through clearing and converting to medicine as a postgrad degree. If you decide Clearing is not for you, then retaking your exams may be an option but, because medicine is such a competitive degree, you should check with the universities you're interested in to see what their view is on retakes. We always recommend students are around when receiving their A-level results but, since you're abroad, you should definitely call up your school or college and chat through your options with them too.Helena I am sorry to hear you didn't get the grades you needed for your first choice course. If you are not sure of your results I would suggest the first step is to contact your school or college to confirm exactly what you got. There may be options through clearing, but take your time and make sure any places you are offered are what you really want. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the options available to you too, so I would suggest you start there.  I am sure you will find an option that's right for you.Cath My results are higher than expected. I had accepted a place at Teesside but now have the choice to go to a different university to do the same course. Would it be better to change? Melanie Hi Melanie, Well done on your results. Take a little time to think about your options.  You can have a look to see if there are any places available at other universitiesthrough the adjustment process.,externalLook through the opportunities available and talk it through with someone. Consider the pros and cons of your current option and any new options. Good luck! I am sure you will come to the best decision for you and your career plans.Cath Hi Melanie, Congratulations on achieving brilliant results. You have the option toapply for a new uni place through UCAS adjustment,externalbut whether you do this is entirely a personal decision. Just because you can, does not necessarily mean you should. Most likely you've already researched your confirmed choice of uni and visited it on an open day, so you have probably put a lot of thought into this course already. If you haven't gone into school, I would suggest going in and chatting through your options with a teacher or careers adviser.Research the new uni course,externalas much as you can and, if possible try to visit the university or city this weekend. Some unis will have open days the weekend after results day. Bear in mind you have five days from results day to use adjustment, so you have to act fairly quickly, but try not to panic and rush a decision where you're not fully informed. Best of luck!Helena All students in my son's class were projected As or Bs in music A-level but received Cs and Ds. Given that everyone failed to reach projected grades suggests that something is wrong somewhere. Is there a process available that would allow us to question the marking? Peter Hi Peter, I am sorry to hear that your son's result in music wasn't what he expected. Your son's school or college will be best placed to advise you on a review of marking. If all the results were not what they were expecting, they may already be looking at this. I hope that this result doesn't impact on your son's plans and wish him well for his future.Cath Your son should speak to his schoolabout appealing against his grade, based on the results he's achieved,externaland his future aspirations. Inquiries can take a few different forms, from a clerical recheck to access to scripts. The school will be able to pursue this further on his behalf, should appealing be deemed the best step forward.Helena Basically I have failed biology and chemistry. I heard I might be able to retake in November. Is this true? Umar, London Hello!  I am sorry to hear that your results didn't go the way you had planned.  I would suggest that you contact your school or college about retake opportunities. They will be best placed to advise on retaking your exams and on any other options available to you to help you achieve your career aims.Cath Sorry to hear you didn't get the results you were hoping for. If you haven't already, I would recommend going into your school or college and talking to your teachers or careers advisers. Under the new A-level system, retakes occur at the following May or June, but your school should be able to confirm this depending on their retakes policy. If you want to understand more about what options you have after failing an exam, take a look at our advice guide.Helena The exams were taken in May and June I have received my A-level results for biology, chemistry and maths and my grades are AAB instead of the A*A*A I had been predicted. I would really like to see my papers or order a review. What would you advise me to do? Abdi Sorry to hear you haven't got the results you wanted, but try not to panic. If you would like to appeal against any of your grades, you'll need to speak to your school about this. For example, a careers adviser or the head of your department or sixth form. They'll be able to discuss your options in light of your results to help you figure out the best next steps, and if necessary action an appeal for you. It's not something you can do on your own. Take a look at Which? University's full guide to appealing against an A-level grade,externalfor more information around this. In the meantime, see if there are any courses in clearing which meet the grades you have achieved. There may be a vacant spot at a uni for the same, or similar, course, that is right for you.Helena Hello! First of all well done! AAB are very good results. If you would like to see your papers or order a review I would suggest that you contact your school or college. They will be best placed to advise you on the next steps. In the meantime, good luck in your future plans.Cath I did not achieve my predicted A-level grades. I got BBC instead of ABB which I needed. So I didn't get into my first choice university. I have been accepted into my second choice for a foundation year but I am quite disappointed. I was wondering whether I could switch from foundation to a better university or if retaking one A-level, which is what I am most keen on, would be better. Tash Hi Tash, These are good results, so well done. Take time to consider your options. You might want to speak to a careers adviser at your school or college. They will be able to advise about the retake option. You can also look atopportunities through clearing.,externalGood luck and don't rush to make a decision.Cath The thing about making a university your first or insurance choice is that you're making a commitment to go there should you get the grades for it. However, that doesn't mean you'll be dragged, kicking and screaming, to take it. You'll need to contact your insurance choice and ask them to formally release you, so youcan enter clearing to find an alternative.,externalGet on the phone to them, with your Ucas ID, and have a cup of tea handy in case you need to wait on the line, and speak to them about it. Regarding retaking an A-level, it's best to discuss this with your school - for example, a careers adviser, or head of department or sixth form. They know you best and can properly advise you based on what grades you've achieved and what you're hoping to go on to do, plus they'll have been through this many times before and will have policies on resits in place.Helena A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades Why clearing 'is not the end of the world"" What was new about this year's A-levels?

What's new about A-levels?,"Thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A and AS-level results. There have been some changes to A-level qualifications recently - the BBC News website sets them out. New AS and A-level syllabuses have been phased in across schools in England since September 2015. The change wasbrought in by the then education secretary Michael Govewith the intention of making the exams more ""fit for purpose"" - in other words, harder. Under the new system, students sit all A-level exams at the end of two years of study, instead of taking modular exams throughout the course, as they had done in previous years. AS-level results no longer count towards A-level grades and levels of coursework have been reduced, with  most courses assessed entirely through exams. Resits will still be available, but January exams have been scrapped, so students will have to wait until May/June of the following year for a chance to improve their grades. In a nutshell, they're on the way out - in England at least. The AS-level has been decoupled from the A-level, which means it operates as a stand-alone qualification and the results do not count towards A-level grades - although in Wales and Northern Ireland, they will still count towards an overall A-level mark. Since this decoupling, the number of entries for AS subjects has fallen dramatically. Provisional figures,externalfrom the Department for Education show that the number of entries for AS subjects fell by almost 60% from 659,880 in 2017 to 269,090 in 2018. This continues the trend which was seen in 2016 and 2017. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said the changes had ""sounded the death knell for AS-levels"". ""The great benefit of the old system was that it gave students a broader range of knowledge and allowed them to keep their options open for longer,"" he said. ""The decision to decouple these qualifications was an entirely unnecessary reform, which is narrowing the curriculum and reducing student choice."" A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades 'Clearing? It's not the end of the world' Yes, that's right. The changes are being phased in over a period of four years. In summer 2017,Year 13s took the new examsin: art and design biology business chemistry computer science economics English language English language and literature English literature history physics psychology sociology This summer, 2018, new A-level exams were taken in: ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin) dance drama and theatre geography modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish) music physical education religious studies Next summer, 2019, candidates will sit the new A-level qualifications in the following subjects: accounting ancient history classical civilisation design and technology electronics environmental science film studies further mathematics geology government and politics history of art (A-level only) law mathematics media studies modern foreign languages (Chinese, Italian, Russian) music technology philosophy statistics And, in summer 2020, new exams will be taken in: ancient languages modern foreign languages (Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Greek, Japanese, modern Hebrew, Panjabi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Urdu) There have been no major changes in the other nations. In Wales and Northern Ireland, AS-levels have remained an integral part of studying for A-levels. In Wales A-levels have also been updated. AS-levels contribute 40% of the total marks of the full A-level and can be taken at the end of the AS course or alongside A2. In Scotland, students do not sit A-levels and AS-levels. Instead, they take Highers and Advanced Highers. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year.

"Clearing 'is not end of the world""","Ellie says it's important to stay calm What are the options when A-level grades are not what you were expecting for your next step? Teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland find out on Thursday whether they have got into the university of their choice - but not all will be successful. ""I didn't intend to apply to university through clearing, I just unfortunately didn't get the A-level results I needed to get into my original choices,"" says Ellie Clarke, 21. Ellie says she didn't want her A-levels to hold her back from going to university, so she decided to use clearing and get a place that way. ""I don't think anyone enjoys not getting the grades they wanted, and it's not fun having to ring around universities trying to find a place on a course you like."" Although Ellie found the situation she was in stressful at the time, she says it's definitely not the end of the world - she was offered a place at the University of Derby, has just graduated with a BSc in Human Biology and is now heading off to Warwick University to study medicine. A-level results 2018: Teenagers achieve rise in top grades A-level results 2018: We answer your questions What's new about this year's A-levels? Clearing, which isrun by the admissions service Ucas,external, is the way that universities and colleges fill any places they still have on their degree courses, and allows would-be undergraduates to see which courses still have places remaining. If you're using it this year, Ellie suggests: ""Do some preparation beforehand - I made sure that I had read through the clearing application process so I would be able to get started making phone calls straight away, without having to look up how the whole process works. ""Importantly, I'd tell people that while not getting into any of your choice [of] universities feels like the end of the world at the time, it's going to be OK. ""Stay calm, do your research on the courses that are available, so you don't jump into a course you don't like just for the sake of getting into university."" Amanda Ng, 21, who also secured her degree place at the University of East Anglia (UEA) through clearing, says: ""Don't be scared about entering clearing. Amanda has recently graduated and has got a job in journalism ""The process is designed to help you choose the best university for you. There are still many great universities with places available in clearing."" Amanda narrowly missed out on her first choice of university after receiving four points fewer than she needed, and applied to UEA through clearing, after deciding that she didn't want to go to her second-choice university. ""I was anxious to officially decline the offer I had been given by my second-choice university, but the process of clearing was so easy it gave me confidence. ""I found it simple, fast and efficient and I was informed I'd received a place at UEA only a few days after I'd entered the process."" Students can sign intoUcas,externalTrack from 08:00 on Thursday 16 August to see their status. You can also follow Ucas on Twitter@ucas_online,externalor onFacebook.com/ucasonline,externalfor up-to-date information. For more information you can also call the Ucas customer experience centre on 0371 468 0468. Lines are open from 07:30 to 19:00 on Thursday, 16 August, 08:00 to 18:00 on Friday, 09:00 to 14:00 on Saturday 18 and 10:00 to 14:00 on Sunday 19 August. Ellie says: ""The Ucas website has a lot of good information about the clearing process, which is really worth reading and getting familiar with - it helped me to understand what I needed to do, and what would happen to make an application. ""There's also a lot of good information online from other people who have been through the process, which made things a little clearer for me."" For more general careers advice you can also call the Exam Results Helpline on 0800 100 900, which is run by theNational Careers Service,external. It is a free service and is open from 08:00 to 22:00, seven days a week. It is staffed by careers advisers and offers advice on sixth form, college, university and other education choices, skills, qualifications, and subject choices, resits and re-marks, gap years, vocational learning routes including diplomas, apprenticeships, careers and employment, confirmation, clearing, adjustment and funding. Ucas operates a system calledadjustment,externalfor those students who get better results than expected and want to try to get a place at a more competitive university. Candidates have a five-day window in which to show their application to universities. If you don't find a suitable place somewhere else through adjustment, you remain accepted at your original choice. University is not for everyone and, by not going to university, there is the added advantage of not accruing student debt. Many people without degrees go on to pursue highly successful and lucrative careers - Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and Kirstie Allsopp to name a few famous ones. Some careers, such as accountancy, can be pursued with qualifications you study for while working. Apprenticeships are another possibility - vacancies are listed on theNational Apprenticeships Service,externalwebsite. John Cope, head of education and skills at the CBI, said: ""University absolutely offers students a great next step but is by no means the only route to a higher-level education. ""There are a range of different options - a Higher National Certificate or Diploma, a foundation degree, or a ""degree apprenticeship"", with an apprenticeship offering the chance to gain both a qualification employers value and start earning a salary straight away."" NICEIC, which provides assessment and certification services for electricians, says the average salary for electricians around the country is Â£47,265. Darren Staniforth, technical development manager at NICEIC, says: ""The perception that you can only have a successful career if you study at university, is a false one. ""Students are increasingly taking an interest in trade industries - with apprenticeships becoming a much more enticing proposition."" If giving university a miss sounds right for you, websites likeNot Going to Uni,externalcan offer suggestions of alternative routes you can take. However, many professions, such as teaching and law, do require a degree and you could find that some doors are closed to you later in life - or are much harder to open - if you do not have one. There is always the option of taking a gap year and reapplying for degree courses or apprenticeships this autumn. A year out can be a chance to develop new skills which can all help when writing a personal statement or CV - volunteer work, travelling abroad or a working for a year are all options to consider. In the longer term, it may be better to wait a year and go somewhere that is right for you, rather than make a hasty decision which you might regret later. Your local further education college should be able to help with information about other routes to degree-level qualifications, such as foundation degrees and diplomas. Whatever you decide, try to stay calm and make decisions when you've had a chance to think things through. Amanda says: ""I carefully talked things through with my family before I made each decision throughout the process. ""Remember to breathe deeply, remain positive, and take a moment before you make those calls - you're certainly not alone."" Ellie adds: ""Don't worry - each university is amazing in their own way, so wherever you end up, you'll enjoy it."" A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades A-level results a surprise?

"A-level results 2018: Rise in top gradesA-level results show a rise in top grades, as a record proportion of 18-year-olds head to university.Family & Education","A-level students have been awarded the highest proportion of As and A*s since 2012, amid changes toughening the exams in England. Some 26.4% of exams have been awarded these top grades this year - but the proportion gaining A* to C dropped to 78.4% from 79% last year. England's exams regulator has said the results show a steady national picture at a time of significant change. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their results. Overall, 97.6% of A-level entries were awarded A* to E grades. Examiners dismissed the rise in top grades as ""extremely marginal"", while Ofqual has underlined that results have remained steady. In 2012, 26.6% of exams were awarded As and A*s. And in 2017, 26.3% achieved these top grades. A-level results 2018: Experts answer your questions What's new about this year's A-levels? Clearing: ""It's not the end of the world"" Unconditional university offer 'gave me confidence' Welsh students see rise in top grades In England, A-levels have been moving away from coursework and returning to students being graded on final exams. However, a mix of old-style and new exams are being taken in Wales and Northern Ireland. Last year, students in England took new, more challenging exams in 13 subjects, with 11 more following this year. The remaining subjects are being refreshed over the next two years. Regulator Ofqual promised grade boundaries could be lowered, once papers were marked, if the new exams were tougher than expected. This video can not be played BBC Rewind: The highs, lows and... embarrassing mums A-levels have also been separated from AS-levels in England, leading to a significant decline in the numbers sitting the separate exam at the end of the first year. For the second year running, boys have outperformed girls at the top grades. Last year, this happened for the first time in 17 years, amid the move to the new-style exams. This year 26.6% of exam entries for boys were awarded an A or A*, compared with 26.2% of girls. This compares with 26.6% and 26.1% respectively last year. There has been a rise in the number of students taking Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. These subjects accounted for over a third of A-level entries, but are still favoured by boys. In Wales, there have been improvements in students' performance at the top grades, with 26.3% getting A* and A grades. It means Welsh results at the top end are now in line with the overall UK figure, after lagging behind for several years. The regulator Ofqual says that grade boundaries have remained ""relatively stable"". It has compared the first batch of 13 reformed A-levels in England, sat in 2017, with those taken this year. This shows that, for 124 papers, the A grade boundary decreased this year, while it increased for 118 papers and for 95 papers, stayed the same. There was a decrease in the marks needed for a grade E in 91 papers, an increase for 110 papers and in 136 papers, the boundary stayed the same. ""Overall, the grade boundaries for individual papers are relatively stable compared to last summer,"" Ofqual said. ""At both grades A and E, a similar number of grade boundaries have increased as have decreased. ""On average, the grade boundaries at grade A have changed by around a quarter of a raw mark, and the grade boundaries at grade E have changed by less than a quarter of a raw mark."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds congratulated everyone receiving their results. He said: ""It is the culmination of a lot of hard work and dedication - from both those receiving their marks and the teachers who've been supporting them every step of the way. ""They should rightly feel proud of their achievements."" But Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the sheer weight of the changes had placed an intolerable additional strain on staff and students. ""We have no doubt that this has affected the mental health and wellbeing of a proportion of young people and teachers,"" he said. He urged the government to pay heed and ensure any future changes were introduced in a more manageable and considered manner. Students celebrating their results include Caitlyn Palmer, Mohamed Dini Munye Abrar and Daniella Adeluwoye Student Daniella Adeluwoye, from London, said she was ""ecstatic"" after winning a place at the University of Cambridge - despite teachers advising her not to apply for the course after ""average"" GCSE results. Caitlyn Palmer, whose place at the University of York has been confirmed, said her teachers were ""so supportive"" when she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression during her A-levels, adding the stress placed on students is ""completely unfair"". 'I didn't know black people went to Cambridge' Ucas figures show 411,860 students have taken university places so far - down 1% on last year. But a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population have already been accepted. A dip in the number of 18-year-olds, due to a lower birth rate in 2000, means universities are looking to fill their places Even the more selective universities are offering places to students through clearing which is the process by which universities fill their unallocated course places. There has also been a rise in unconditional offers and other ways of attracting students, such as bursaries. Ucas said thatlast year about one in eight people accepted to full-time university courses got there through clearing,external. This year, 30,000 courses are available through the Ucas system. For students who took Btec qualifications, results were released on Wednesday. Btecs, which also count towards Ucas points, are specialist work-related qualifications, designed for young people interested in working in a particular sector or industry. And in Scotland, results for Highers and Advanced Highers were published last week. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes,with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the exact percentage figures relating to the proportion of exam entries by boys and girls awarded an A or A*. These have now been amended. A-level results a surprise? Experts answer your questions What's new about 2018 A-levels?

A-level results a surprise? We answer your questionsThe results day cliches you'll see todayWhat was new about this year's A-levels?VideoVideoUnconditional offer 'gave me confidence',"Catherine Sezen (L), a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges and Helena Poole (R), editor of Which? University, are ready to answer your questions For those of you whose A-level results were not what you expected, we have experts ready to provide advice. There is still time to find a university place through clearing or perhaps opt for a completely different path into a career if your results were not what you needed - or maybe you have a decision to make if you managed to achieve better results than predicted. Cath Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Helena Poole, editor of Which? University, are on hand to offer personalised advice on what to do. Teenagers achieve rise in top A-level grades Why clearing is 'not the end of the world' What was new about this year's exams? I received a call from Leeds University medical school, who suggested that because my grades were higher than expected I should apply to them through clearing and drop my existing offer of a place to do biomedicine at Manchester. My teacher helped me verify that the call was genuine but when I rang Leeds they said my grades were not in fact high enough, which means I have now lost both places. What can I do? Oliver Hi Oliver, First of all well done on achieving such good grades. I would suggest that you contact Leeds University admissions and explain what you have explained here. Perhaps your teacher would be able to help you make the call. It would be helpful if you had the name of the caller and/or the time of the call. I would also suggest contacting Manchester and explaining what happened too. Don't panic, perhaps there has been a mix-up and it always pays to check again. I am sure you will find a place and will go on to do really well in your chosen career.Cath I'm sorry to hear this, especially since you've done better than expected and should be celebrating. This is very strange. You should get back in touch with Leeds, if necessary, someone higher up the pecking order, and explain the situation. It sounds like there has been a miscommunication somewhere and you've unfortunately caught the short end of the stick, especially since they contacted you and you have achieved their entry requirements. Verify what these are on Ucas or the uni's website. Do you have anything in writing, maybe an email, that illustrates what you were told on the phone, or the name, department or position of the person who spoke to you? This will be handy to have when you get in touch. With clearing calls, it's up to students to pick up the phone; but in this case, you may like to ask a parent or family member to phone on your behalf if you'd prefer, but stay close by if they want to speak to you. Also, get in touch with Manchester and explain the situation. Given that they originally accepted you, and the exceptional circumstances, we would hope they would understand the situation and offer your place back, although this may depend on numbers and places. For anyone achieving higher grades and contemplating choosing a different uni with higher entry grades, we would always recommend taking a step back and deciding if it's the best choice for you. Don't be swayed by a course just because it has higher entry grades, consider if it's ultimately right for you. We really hope this gets resolved and you can get back to celebrating soon.Helena My son was holding a place for Bristol on an offer of AAB. He achieved A*BB. Both amount to the same Ucas tariff points (136) but his offer to Bristol has been declined as he did not ""meet the exact terms of the offer"". So, does this mean if he'd got AAA, he would have been rejected? Of course not. The course is not in clearing but he was applying for a deferred place to 2019 in any event. Any suggestions? Robert First of all congratulations to your son.  A*BB is a good set of results.  I would suggest that you or your son contact Bristol again and explain he is looking for a deferred place for next year and find out what they would be able to offer for next year. Bristol is very competitive and they may require him to retake one of his A-levels. But if that is the course he wants, it might be the best solution.  On the other hand, there may well be another university that would have a course that would be right for your son. The results he has will stand him in good stead for success whether it is at Bristol or another university.Cath Sorry to hear that your son was not accepted to his first choice of uni. While it's frustrating because the Ucas points are the same, unfortunately some universities can get quite specific about achieving certain grades in certain subjects. That being said, if you haven't already, it might be worth him speaking to someone at Bristol to double check if there's any leeway. Since he's deferring his place, he can reapply to universities for 2019 with A*AB grades and could potentially secure a guaranteed offer because he already has his results. If he's dead set on this specific university and the grade requirements are the same in 2019, he has the option to resit some exams next year. It's also worth checking that the 2019 course grade requirements haven't changed from the 2018 ones.Helena I am currently abroad but according to Ucas Track I did not meet the grades for medicine or biomedical sciences at King's College London. I really want to study medicine and don't want to take a gap year, but maybe I should retake and reapply next year. Is it possibly to apply for medicine through clearing? Maham Hi Maham, You must be feeling a bit disappointed but there are options available to you. Clearing,externaldoesn't usually offer medicine courses but I'vehad a quick check of the live vacancies,externaland there are some medicine courses listed on there. If any of these interest you, you'll want to call up your school and check exactly what grades you got, to see if you meet the entry requirements for the clearing courses. Competitive courses can get snapped up quickly so try and move fast, but be sure to check the course is what you're looking for before jumping in and accepting an offer. If you go for this option you will need to phone the number on the clearing page and be ready to talk through why you want to study that course in particular. If you don't find anything you want, you may want to consider taking a Biomedical Science course through clearing and converting to medicine as a postgrad degree. If you decide Clearing is not for you, then retaking your exams may be an option but, because medicine is such a competitive degree, you should check with the universities you're interested in to see what their view is on retakes. We always recommend students are around when receiving their A-level results but, since you're abroad, you should definitely call up your school or college and chat through your options with them too.Helena I am sorry to hear you didn't get the grades you needed for your first choice course. If you are not sure of your results I would suggest the first step is to contact your school or college to confirm exactly what you got. There may be options through clearing, but take your time and make sure any places you are offered are what you really want. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the options available to you too, so I would suggest you start there.  I am sure you will find an option that's right for you.Cath My results are higher than expected. I had accepted a place at Teesside but now have the choice to go to a different university to do the same course. Would it be better to change? Melanie Hi Melanie, Well done on your results. Take a little time to think about your options.  You can have a look to see if there are any places available at other universitiesthrough the adjustment process.,externalLook through the opportunities available and talk it through with someone. Consider the pros and cons of your current option and any new options. Good luck! I am sure you will come to the best decision for you and your career plans.Cath Hi Melanie, Congratulations on achieving brilliant results. You have the option toapply for a new uni place through UCAS adjustment,externalbut whether you do this is entirely a personal decision. Just because you can, does not necessarily mean you should. Most likely you've already researched your confirmed choice of uni and visited it on an open day, so you have probably put a lot of thought into this course already. If you haven't gone into school, I would suggest going in and chatting through your options with a teacher or careers adviser.Research the new uni course,externalas much as you can and, if possible try to visit the university or city this weekend. Some unis will have open days the weekend after results day. Bear in mind you have five days from results day to use adjustment, so you have to act fairly quickly, but try not to panic and rush a decision where you're not fully informed. Best of luck!Helena All students in my son's class were projected As or Bs in music A-level but received Cs and Ds. Given that everyone failed to reach projected grades suggests that something is wrong somewhere. Is there a process available that would allow us to question the marking? Peter Hi Peter, I am sorry to hear that your son's result in music wasn't what he expected. Your son's school or college will be best placed to advise you on a review of marking. If all the results were not what they were expecting, they may already be looking at this. I hope that this result doesn't impact on your son's plans and wish him well for his future.Cath Your son should speak to his schoolabout appealing against his grade, based on the results he's achieved,externaland his future aspirations. Inquiries can take a few different forms, from a clerical recheck to access to scripts. The school will be able to pursue this further on his behalf, should appealing be deemed the best step forward.Helena Basically I have failed biology and chemistry. I heard I might be able to retake in November. Is this true? Umar, London Hello!  I am sorry to hear that your results didn't go the way you had planned.  I would suggest that you contact your school or college about retake opportunities. They will be best placed to advise on retaking your exams and on any other options available to you to help you achieve your career aims.Cath Sorry to hear you didn't get the results you were hoping for. If you haven't already, I would recommend going into your school or college and talking to your teachers or careers advisers. Under the new A-level system, retakes occur at the following May or June, but your school should be able to confirm this depending on their retakes policy. If you want to understand more about what options you have after failing an exam, take a look at our advice guide.Helena The exams were taken in May and June I have received my A-level results for biology, chemistry and maths and my grades are AAB instead of the A*A*A I had been predicted. I would really like to see my papers or order a review. What would you advise me to do? Abdi Sorry to hear you haven't got the results you wanted, but try not to panic. If you would like to appeal against any of your grades, you'll need to speak to your school about this. For example, a careers adviser or the head of your department or sixth form. They'll be able to discuss your options in light of your results to help you figure out the best next steps, and if necessary action an appeal for you. It's not something you can do on your own. Take a look at Which? University's full guide to appealing against an A-level grade,externalfor more information around this. In the meantime, see if there are any courses in clearing which meet the grades you have achieved. There may be a vacant spot at a uni for the same, or similar, course, that is right for you.Helena Hello! First of all well done! AAB are very good results. If you would like to see your papers or order a review I would suggest that you contact your school or college. They will be best placed to advise you on the next steps. In the meantime, good luck in your future plans.Cath I did not achieve my predicted A-level grades. I got BBC instead of ABB which I needed. So I didn't get into my first choice university. I have been accepted into my second choice for a foundation year but I am quite disappointed. I was wondering whether I could switch from foundation to a better university or if retaking one A-level, which is what I am most keen on, would be better. Tash Hi Tash, These are good results, so well done. Take time to consider your options. You might want to speak to a careers adviser at your school or college. They will be able to advise about the retake option. You can also look atopportunities through clearing.,externalGood luck and don't rush to make a decision.Cath The thing about making a university your first or insurance choice is that you're making a commitment to go there should you get the grades for it. However, that doesn't mean you'll be dragged, kicking and screaming, to take it. You'll need to contact your insurance choice and ask them to formally release you, so youcan enter clearing to find an alternative.,externalGet on the phone to them, with your Ucas ID, and have a cup of tea handy in case you need to wait on the line, and speak to them about it. Regarding retaking an A-level, it's best to discuss this with your school - for example, a careers adviser, or head of department or sixth form. They know you best and can properly advise you based on what grades you've achieved and what you're hoping to go on to do, plus they'll have been through this many times before and will have policies on resits in place.Helena A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades Why clearing 'is not the end of the world"" What was new about this year's A-levels?

What was new about this year's A-levels?VideoVideoUnconditional offer 'gave me confidence',"Thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A and AS-level results. There have been some changes to A-level qualifications recently - the BBC News website sets them out. New AS and A-level syllabuses have been phased in across schools in England since September 2015. The change wasbrought in by the then education secretary Michael Govewith the intention of making the exams more ""fit for purpose"" - in other words, harder. Under the new system, students sit all A-level exams at the end of two years of study, instead of taking modular exams throughout the course, as they had done in previous years. AS-level results no longer count towards A-level grades and levels of coursework have been reduced, with  most courses assessed entirely through exams. Resits will still be available, but January exams have been scrapped, so students will have to wait until May/June of the following year for a chance to improve their grades. In a nutshell, they're on the way out - in England at least. The AS-level has been decoupled from the A-level, which means it operates as a stand-alone qualification and the results do not count towards A-level grades - although in Wales and Northern Ireland, they will still count towards an overall A-level mark. Since this decoupling, the number of entries for AS subjects has fallen dramatically. Provisional figures,externalfrom the Department for Education show that the number of entries for AS subjects fell by almost 60% from 659,880 in 2017 to 269,090 in 2018. This continues the trend which was seen in 2016 and 2017. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said the changes had ""sounded the death knell for AS-levels"". ""The great benefit of the old system was that it gave students a broader range of knowledge and allowed them to keep their options open for longer,"" he said. ""The decision to decouple these qualifications was an entirely unnecessary reform, which is narrowing the curriculum and reducing student choice."" A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades 'Clearing? It's not the end of the world' Yes, that's right. The changes are being phased in over a period of four years. In summer 2017,Year 13s took the new examsin: art and design biology business chemistry computer science economics English language English language and literature English literature history physics psychology sociology This summer, 2018, new A-level exams were taken in: ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin) dance drama and theatre geography modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish) music physical education religious studies Next summer, 2019, candidates will sit the new A-level qualifications in the following subjects: accounting ancient history classical civilisation design and technology electronics environmental science film studies further mathematics geology government and politics history of art (A-level only) law mathematics media studies modern foreign languages (Chinese, Italian, Russian) music technology philosophy statistics And, in summer 2020, new exams will be taken in: ancient languages modern foreign languages (Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Greek, Japanese, modern Hebrew, Panjabi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Urdu) There have been no major changes in the other nations. In Wales and Northern Ireland, AS-levels have remained an integral part of studying for A-levels. In Wales A-levels have also been updated. AS-levels contribute 40% of the total marks of the full A-level and can be taken at the end of the AS course or alongside A2. In Scotland, students do not sit A-levels and AS-levels. Instead, they take Highers and Advanced Highers. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year.

Delays as tractor ploughs over rail track,"The fire service worked to remove the tractor, which was tangled in a damaged gantry A tractor towing a trailer damaged tracks and overhead electric wires after it rolled on to a railway line, causing major disruption to services. The vehicle demolished a gantry at Fitzwilliam, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, at 20:55 BST on Wednesday. It was removed at about 05:40 BST, but passengers were warned of delays on services to Leeds, London, Glasgow and Plymouth due to repair work. Services were disrupted until 13:00 when the line opened. No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made, British Transport Police said. The tractor towing a trailer was found on the tracks covered by an uprooted tree and was removed early on Thursday morning Pictures of the scene show an uprooted tree on top of the tractor, which stopped on the tracks.

Man called in bomb hoax to delay flight,"Jacob Meir Abdellak, from Hackney, called police eight minutes before his flight was due to take off A passenger who called in a bomb hoax in order to delay his flight has been jailed. Jacob Meir Abdellak rang police eight minutes before the plane was due to leave Gatwick Airport for Los Angeles on 11 May. The phone number used to make the call was the same one Abdellak used to book his flight, Sussex Police said. He admitted a false information charge at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday and was sentenced to 10 months. Abdellak, from Hackney in east London, made the anonymous call at 05:47 BST, delaying take-off by 90 minutes. Inquiries revealed the 47-year-old had been abusive towards airline employees when they did not allow him to board as a result of being late for the flight. He was told to return on another date to rearrange his flight, the force said. The librarian was arrested at Gatwick 11 days later on 22 May as he attempted to board another flight to the United States. The French national admitted the telephone number used to make the hoax call was his, but claimed he could not have made the call as he had lost the Sim card days earlier. Abdellak previously pleaded not guilty to the charge of communicating false information regarding a noxious substance. But he changed his plea on the day the trial was due to start and was ordered to pay a Â£140 victim surcharge as well as serving his jail term. Gatwick Police Ch Insp Marc Clothier said Abdellak's actions were ""ridiculous"". ""He was running late for his flight and thought it would be a good idea to call in a hoax bomb. This turned out to be the worst decision he could have made. ""His actions caused a level of fear and distress among a number of staff and passengers on board that flight.""

Sweden Muslim woman wins handshake case,"Ms Alhajeh said she brought the case on behalf of others who could find themselves in the same position A Swedish Muslim woman has won compensation after her job interview was ended when she refused a handshake. Farah Alhajeh, 24, was applying for a job as an interpreter when she declined to shake the hand of a male interviewer for religious reasons. She placed her hand over her heart in greeting instead. The Swedish labour court ruled the company had discriminated against her and ordered it to pay 40,000 kronor ($4,350; Â£3,420) in compensation. Some Muslims avoid physical contact with members of the opposite sex, except for those in their immediate family. However handshakes are traditional in Europe. Additionally, anti-discrimination legislation may forbid companies and public bodies from treating people differently because of their gender. Is it easier to get a job as Adam or Mohamed? Muslim women 'most disadvantaged' Half US Muslims 'discriminated against' Sweden's discrimination ombudsman's office, which represented 24-year-old Ms Alhajeh, said the judgement had taken into account ""the employer's interests, the individual's right to bodily integrity, and the importance of the state to maintain protection for religious freedom"". The interpreting company in Ms Alhajeh's home town of Uppsala had argued that its staff were required to treat men and women equally and could not allow a staff member to refuse a handshake based on gender. But the discrimination ombudsman said she had tried to avoid upsetting anyone by placing her hand over her heart when greeting both men and women. Sweden's labour court found the company was justified in demanding equal treatment for both sexes - but not in demanding that it be in the form of a handshake only. Her refusal to shake hands on religious grounds was protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, it said, and the company's policy in demanding a specific greeting was detrimental to Muslims. The court also disagreed with the firm's assertion that Ms Alhajeh's approach to greetings would cause a problem for effective communication as an interpreter. However the judges were divided over the case - with three supporting Ms Alhajeh's claim and two voting against. After the judgement Ms Alhajeh told the BBC she believed it was important to ""never give in"" when convinced that one is in the right, even as a member of a minority group. ""I believe in God, which is very rare in Sweden... and I should be able to do that and be accepted as long as I'm not hurting anyone,"" she said. ""In my country... you cannot treat women and men differently. I respect that. That's why I don't have any physical contact with men or with women. I can live by the rules of my religion and also at the same time follow the rules of the country that I live in,"" she added. She had complained about her treatment to the discrimination ombudsman's office, which said that the ""difficult issue"" was important enough to go to a court for judgement. In 2016a Swiss school's decision to exempt two Muslim boys from shaking both male and female teachers' handsafter they refused to shake the hand of a female teacher caused uproar and led to the family's citizenship process being suspended In April,an Algerian woman was denied French citizenshipafter refusing to shake the hand of an official during her citizenship ceremony Muslim women 'most disadvantaged' Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job?

Football fans told to stay away by council,"Chorley Council does not want hundreds of fans visiting the town centre before matches in Bolton, Blackburn, Preston, Burnley and Wigan Football fans have been told to stay away from a Lancashire town where travelling supporters regularly stop off on their way to games. Chorley Council wants to stop coaches of away fans from visiting its town centre, because it says they have been ""intimidating"" residents and shoppers. A letter has been sent to clubs saying fans were ""not welcome"". The Lancashire town is a stop-off for fans on their way to games at Bolton, Blackburn, Preston, Burnley and Wigan. Chorley councillor Danny Gee, who sent the letter on behalf of the council's Town Centre Team, later clarified they were specifically targeting coach loads of fans and admitted the letter ""could have been worded better"". This video can not be played Chorley councillor Danny Gee says fans congregating outside pubs is a 'big problem'. Gee told BBC Radio 5 live that congregating coaches had become a ""big problem"". He added the request had come from residents and business owners, who said their takings had dropped on match days. The letterrefers,externalto a story from April, where hundreds of Wolves fans visited Chorley before an away game at Bolton, but said they had been ""relatively good-natured"". It was widely criticised on social media and the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) said it was seeking legal advice. ""Football fans being told they're not welcome in pubs is one thing but to be told formally by a council they're not welcome in a whole town?! Wow! I'm genuinely speechless at this,"" tweeted FSF caseworker Amanda Jacks. Chorley FC, known as the Magpies, play in National League North, the sixth tier of English football. Responding to a tweet the council sent congratulating Chorley on a win, Jacks replied: ""You can't have your cake and eat it. You either welcome football in your town, or you don't."" Reiterating the council's position, Gee told the Phil Williams show it was not banning anyone and it was ""powerless"" because of a lack of police. He added: ""Fans are welcome, but we are not welcoming large amount of coaches with 100 and 200 fans, congregating outside pubs and disrupting the town centre. ""They stand outside pubs and intimidate shoppers and families. They arrive at 12pm and leave at 2.30pm - by that time most of the shoppers have left."" In a statement, the council added: ""If the clubs themselves see fit to stop away fans entering some of their local pubs and don't sell alcohol in the ground why should that perceived problem be passed on to our town centre to deal with? ""As we stated in the letter we have done a lot of work and invested a lot of time and money into the town centre and we don't want Saturdays, which are one of the busiest days for traders, to be affected by people put off by football fans causing anti-social behaviour.""

Celebrities warned over social media ads,"Former reality TV star Stephanie Davis was warned by the ASA that she must clearly label ads on social media An investigation has begun into whether celebrities are making it clear when they are paid to endorse a product on social media. The UK's competition watchdog has written to a number of influencers, including household names, to question how they operate. These people, often with millions of social media followers, should make any commissioned posts immediately clear. The regulator said it would name anyone found to be flouting the rules. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has not released the names of celebrities, thought to be in double figures, who have been contacted as yet, but a string of well-known people have been admonished by the UK's advertising watchdog in recent times. Recent cases where the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has intervened include: Aphoto of some vitaminsfrom lifestyle company Convits along with a promotion code posted by former reality TV star Stephanie Davis: the ASA said it was not clear that it was an advert A post by the make-up blogger Sheikhbeauty on Instagrampromoting Flat Tummy Tea,externalthat did not make clear she was being paid by the drinks company A tweet by the TV presenter AJ Odudu that featured aphoto of an Alpro dessert,externalwith text describing it as one of her favourite snacks, but without any acknowledgement that she was being paid to promote it on social media A video uploaded by Made In Chelsea TV star Millie Mackintoshadvertising a Britvic drink,externalthat used #sp - referring to ""sponsored post"" - to identify its nature. The ASA said it did not think consumers would realise what the hashtag referred to. The CMA said that celebrities could sway the shopping habits of millions of people by telling followers on channels such as Twitter, YouTube and Instagram where they have been on holiday, what they wear, what products they use or which books they read. Consumer protection regulations state that anyone should make it clear in editorial content at first sight if they have been paid or rewarded in some way. The risk is that consumers might be more likely to place their trust in a product if they think it has had the personal recommendation of someone they admire, without realising the post is part of a commercial agreement. ""It is really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand,"" said George Lusty, senior director at the CMA. The CMA has asked the public toshare their experiences as part of the investigation,external. The investigation, which has no set deadline, could lead to naming and shaming of anyone breaking the rules, and potentially prosecutions. Courts can issue unlimited fines or even imprisonment in extreme cases.

Rugby star Danny Cipriani fined for assault,"This video can not be played Cipriani leaves Jersey court after assault charge England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been fined Â£2,000 after an assault in a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester player pleaded guilty to common assault and resisting arrest and was ordered to pay Â£250 compensation to a woman police officer. She has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill. Three other charges - assault on police, larceny and being disorderly on licensed premises - were dropped. More stories from the Channel Islands Ciprianitweeted,externalhe was ""truly sorry... most importantly [to] the police"" and was ""mortified"" by his actions. The 30-year-old fly-half has seven days to pay the fine and compensation or face 10 weeks in prison. The officer has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill Defence advocate Mike Preston told Jersey Magistrates' Court Cipriani was sorry for the ""confusing situation"" and was ""mortified if he harmed the police officer in any way"". Mr Preston said Cipriani ""had too many drinks"" at Drift nightclub in The Royal Yacht Hotel, St Helier, and police were called when he tried to grab a body camera off a doorman. Mr Preston argued his client did this because fame had made him more sensitive to being filmed and he was confused by the situation. He was later picked up by police but managed to escape from his cuffs and a second officer was needed to restrain him. Police were called after Cipriani tried to grab a doorman's body camera at Drift nightclub Cipriani is said to have sworn at the officer, telling her to get off him. The court heard she was left with bruises on her bicep and red marks on her neck. The former Wasps and Sale stand-off did not think he had done anything wrong at the time and did not understand why the police had been called, the court was told. The club is part of The Royal Yacht Hotel in St Helier He was in Jersey with his club as part of a pre-season tour and was supported in court by Gloucester team captain Willi Heinz. Cipriani, who moved to Kingsholm in the summer, is due to make his debut in a friendly against Ulster on Saturday. In response to his player's guilty plea, Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan commented: ""We will deal with it in a robust but balanced way but based purely on the facts. ""As a high-profile sportsperson there is often a large degree of public and media scrutiny involved, which Danny is well aware of. ""The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved. ""He knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club. However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support.""

Last week Cipriani vowed to ""do everything"" to remain in the England set-up after making his first Test match start in 10 years during the summer tour to South Africa. He was dropped from the national side in 2008 - the same year he won his first cap - after visiting a nightclub prior to a match against Scotland. In 2011, Cipriani was fined by his then club Melbourne Rebels for taking a bottle of vodka from a nightclub and later in the same year served a one-match ban for breaking a team curfew. Four years later he was banned for driving for 18 months and ordered to pay fines and costs totalling Â£7,620 after being found to be nearly twice the drink-drive limit. Cipriani has played 16 times for England since his international debut in 2008 Over the last year or so the rugby had really been doing the talking for Danny Cipriani. Many thought he wouldn't get a look in under Eddie Jones but Jones recalled him for the tour of South Africa in June. He kept his head down, worked extremely hard on the tour, got a start in the third Test and set up the try which led to an England victory. I think in terms of his club future, Gloucester will put it down as an incident they can move on from. At the moment, England are staying very tight-lipped. It's pretty hard to second guess Eddie Jones' position. In the past, Jones has said that what happens on club duty is not to do with him and that if someone behaves themselves on and off the field in an England camp, that's what he's interested in. On the tour of South Africa, Cipriani's behaviour was exemplary and Jones made a big point of saying that before selecting Cipriani for the third Test. But with the World Cup on the horizon, no England players can afford slip-ups, let alone players whose behaviour in the past has been called into question. Cipriani just had to keep his head down. He was probably in the best place he's been in for a decade. Gloucester were saying Cipriani had been worked extremely hard in pre-season and that he'd been a fantastic addition to the club. Up until Tuesday night, things were going swimmingly. He must just feel so disappointed with himself. His international future is now hanging by a thread.

US media attack Trump's 'dirty war',"The Boston Globe made a plea for editorial unity last week More than 300 news outlets have launched a campaign to counter US President Donald Trump's attacks and promote a free press. The Boston Globe made the call last week for a nationwide denouncement of the president's ""dirty war"" against the media, using the hashtag #EnemyOfNone. Mr Trump has derided media reports as ""fake news"" and attacked journalists as ""enemies of the people"". Andhe tweeted on Thursday,external: ""The fake news media is the opposition party."" ""It is very bad for our great country... But we are winning!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UN experts have warned that Mr Trump's comments about the media raise the risk of violence against journalists. UN experts condemn Trump media attacks Why Trump attacks the media The Boston Globe had pledged to write an editorial ""on the dangers of the administration's assault on the press"" on 16 August, and asked others to do the same. This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC: How the news divides America The initial positive response from 100 news organisations has grown closer to 350 with major US national newspapers and smaller local outlets answering the call, along with international publicationslike the UK newspaper The Guardian,external. A screenshot of the New York Times' editorial Starting with theBoston Globeitself, the editorial there, headlined Journalists Are Not The Enemy, argued that a free press had been a core American principle for more than 200 years TheNew York Timeschose the headline A Free Press Needs You, calling Mr Trump's attacks ""dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy"". It published excerpts from dozens more publications beneath TheNew York Post- a pro-Trump tabloid - answered the Globe's call by saying ""Who are we to disagree?"" adding: ""It may be frustrating to argue that just because we print inconvenient truths doesn't mean that we're fake news, but being a journalist isn't a popularity contest. All we can do is to keep reporting."" But it also said: ""Will this make a difference? Not one whit"" TheTopeka Capital-Journalwas another paper to join the campaign. It said of Mr Trump's attack on the media: ""It's sinister. It's destructive. And it must end now."" The paper was one of the few to endorse Mr Trump in 2016. The fact that Mr Trump won without such media endorsements may cast doubt on whether the Globe's campaign would actually dent his support. Later on Thursday, President Trump tweeted,externalthat the Globe ""is in collusion with other papers on free press"". How Trump 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants There have been some dissenting voices to the Globe's campaign: At the conservative websiteTownhall.com,Tom Tradup panned the Globe's ""pathetic bid to pretend it is still relevant"", writing: ""I would not presume to tell anyone else what to think or what to do. But as for me - and I suspect many others - I won't be putting any coins in any newspaper box August 16th."" TheWall Street Journaldeclined to take part. An earlier piece by James Freeman argued Mr Trump was entitled to free speech, and the Globe's drive ran counter to the very independence it was seeking. By BBC's White House reporter Tara McKelvey Trust in the media has dipped to an all-time low, and Mr Trump has tapped into this well of discontent, prompting journalistic outcry. In fact ""the media"" - in popular parlance - means an amorphous blob of TV networks. Even people in flyover country, a region where voters supported Mr Trump, see individual reporters in a more nuanced way, as I've discovered. President Trump has been accused of increasing the risk of violence against journalists with his attacks Recently I was interviewing someone in a Kansas liquor store (it's a long story) and a big, burly construction worker burst in the door and shouted: ""The media!"" I looked up uneasily, and he smiled and said I was doing important work. When Mr Trump attacks ""the media"", crowds roar. In general terms, people condemn ""the media"". Privately, though, Mr Trump is chummy with us - and often asks how we're doing. And ordinary people across the US are also gracious towards journalists, showing a real appreciation for their work . A poll released on Tuesday by Quinnipiac University,externalsuggested that 51% of Republican voters now believed the media to be ""the enemy of the people rather than an important part of democracy"" and 52% of the Republican supporters polled were not concerned that Mr Trump's criticism would lead to violence against journalists. Among all voters, 65% believe the news media to be an important part of democracy, the poll suggests. An Ipsos poll, also this month, gave similar figures. In addition it found that 23% of Republicans, and about one in eight Americans overall, believed Mr Trump should close down mainstream news outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times. Mr Trump has certainly ramped up the pressure on mainstream media with numerous tweets. The Trump Twitter Archive says he has tweeted 281 times,externalso far using the term ""fake news"". When he brings up the matter at his rallies, some journalists have felt uneasy about their safety and have even avoided using designated reporter zones. Are journalists increasingly under attack? At a presidential rally in Florida in July, CNN filmed Mr Trump's supporters yelling insults and swearing at reporters covering the event. CNN presenter Jim Acosta tweeted a clip, which contained strong language. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A man was also arrested in January for making threats to CNN employees via telephone calls that referred to ""fake news"". The publisher of the New York Times, AG Sulzberger, told Mr Trump in a personal meeting in July that the president's language was ""contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence"". But most of the Globe's campaign is about maintaining a free press and its own editorial does not even touch on violence. Some outlets do, however, refer to the recent killing of five peopleat the offices of the Capital Gazette in Maryland. This, and an incident in which two journalists were killed live on air in Virginia in 2015, well before Mr Trump was elected, are used to highlight the dangers of the profession, although both were allegedly carried out by people with personal grievances.

Sexual harassment of police staff revealed,"Police chiefs have pledged to tackle sexual harassment of their staff in ""civilian roles"" after a survey revealed the scale of the problem. Incidents included inappropriate touching, leering and staff pressurised into having sex with colleagues. The National Police Chiefs' Council said such behaviour must be ""rooted out"". The survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland was carried out by Unison. Staff who were surveyed included police community support officers, crime scene investigators, clerks, fingerprint experts and detention officers. The survey did not look at the experiences of police officers. Workplace harassment victims 'need better protection' How can businesses tackle sexual harassment? Half of respondents had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague. Around one in 25 said they had been pressured into having sex, and one in 12 had been told that sexual favours could result in preferential treatment. The survey also found: a third had faced intrusive questioning about their private lives more than a fifth had experienced inappropriate staring or leering almost one in five had been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable In the vast majority of cases, the survey respondents said colleagues - either police officers or staff - were responsible. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for professional ethics, Chief Constable Julian Williams, said the research revealed ""outdated and unacceptable behaviour"" that must be ""rooted out"". Such behaviour ""falls short"" of standards set out in the Code of Ethics, which police officers and staff are expected uphold, he said. Sexual harassment at work looks like this 'Half of women' sexually harassed at work He said the NPCC had committed to developing a comprehensive action plan by October to address the issue. ""Some of the behaviour described is predatory and requires the strongest response from police with individuals removed from the service. ""Other behaviours like the repeated telling of sexualised jokes may not be malicious in intent but are misguided and damaging and our focus will be on finding effective ways of challenging them,"" he added. Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said perpetrators should be ""confronted and dealt with immediately"" or ""their behaviour could escalate from filthy jokes to more serious forms of sexual harassment"".

A-level results 2018: Our experts answer your questions,"Catherine Sezen (L), a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges and Helena Poole (R), editor of Which? University, are ready to answer your questions For those of you whose A-level results were not what you expected, we have experts ready to provide advice. There is still time to find a university place through clearing or perhaps opt for a completely different path into a career if your results were not what you needed - or maybe you have a decision to make if you managed to achieve better results than predicted. Cath Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Helena Poole, editor of Which? University, are on hand to offer personalised advice on what to do. Teenagers achieve rise in top A-level grades Why clearing is 'not the end of the world' What was new about this year's exams? I received a call from Leeds University medical school, who suggested that because my grades were higher than expected I should apply to them through clearing and drop my existing offer of a place to do biomedicine at Manchester. My teacher helped me verify that the call was genuine but when I rang Leeds they said my grades were not in fact high enough, which means I have now lost both places. What can I do? Oliver Hi Oliver, First of all well done on achieving such good grades. I would suggest that you contact Leeds University admissions and explain what you have explained here. Perhaps your teacher would be able to help you make the call. It would be helpful if you had the name of the caller and/or the time of the call. I would also suggest contacting Manchester and explaining what happened too. Don't panic, perhaps there has been a mix-up and it always pays to check again. I am sure you will find a place and will go on to do really well in your chosen career.Cath I'm sorry to hear this, especially since you've done better than expected and should be celebrating. This is very strange. You should get back in touch with Leeds, if necessary, someone higher up the pecking order, and explain the situation. It sounds like there has been a miscommunication somewhere and you've unfortunately caught the short end of the stick, especially since they contacted you and you have achieved their entry requirements. Verify what these are on Ucas or the uni's website. Do you have anything in writing, maybe an email, that illustrates what you were told on the phone, or the name, department or position of the person who spoke to you? This will be handy to have when you get in touch. With clearing calls, it's up to students to pick up the phone; but in this case, you may like to ask a parent or family member to phone on your behalf if you'd prefer, but stay close by if they want to speak to you. Also, get in touch with Manchester and explain the situation. Given that they originally accepted you, and the exceptional circumstances, we would hope they would understand the situation and offer your place back, although this may depend on numbers and places. For anyone achieving higher grades and contemplating choosing a different uni with higher entry grades, we would always recommend taking a step back and deciding if it's the best choice for you. Don't be swayed by a course just because it has higher entry grades, consider if it's ultimately right for you. We really hope this gets resolved and you can get back to celebrating soon.Helena My son was holding a place for Bristol on an offer of AAB. He achieved A*BB. Both amount to the same Ucas tariff points (136) but his offer to Bristol has been declined as he did not ""meet the exact terms of the offer"". So, does this mean if he'd got AAA, he would have been rejected? Of course not. The course is not in clearing but he was applying for a deferred place to 2019 in any event. Any suggestions? Robert First of all congratulations to your son.  A*BB is a good set of results.  I would suggest that you or your son contact Bristol again and explain he is looking for a deferred place for next year and find out what they would be able to offer for next year. Bristol is very competitive and they may require him to retake one of his A-levels. But if that is the course he wants, it might be the best solution.  On the other hand, there may well be another university that would have a course that would be right for your son. The results he has will stand him in good stead for success whether it is at Bristol or another university.Cath Sorry to hear that your son was not accepted to his first choice of uni. While it's frustrating because the Ucas points are the same, unfortunately some universities can get quite specific about achieving certain grades in certain subjects. That being said, if you haven't already, it might be worth him speaking to someone at Bristol to double check if there's any leeway. Since he's deferring his place, he can reapply to universities for 2019 with A*AB grades and could potentially secure a guaranteed offer because he already has his results. If he's dead set on this specific university and the grade requirements are the same in 2019, he has the option to resit some exams next year. It's also worth checking that the 2019 course grade requirements haven't changed from the 2018 ones.Helena I am currently abroad but according to Ucas Track I did not meet the grades for medicine or biomedical sciences at King's College London. I really want to study medicine and don't want to take a gap year, but maybe I should retake and reapply next year. Is it possibly to apply for medicine through clearing? Maham Hi Maham, You must be feeling a bit disappointed but there are options available to you. Clearing,externaldoesn't usually offer medicine courses but I'vehad a quick check of the live vacancies,externaland there are some medicine courses listed on there. If any of these interest you, you'll want to call up your school and check exactly what grades you got, to see if you meet the entry requirements for the clearing courses. Competitive courses can get snapped up quickly so try and move fast, but be sure to check the course is what you're looking for before jumping in and accepting an offer. If you go for this option you will need to phone the number on the clearing page and be ready to talk through why you want to study that course in particular. If you don't find anything you want, you may want to consider taking a Biomedical Science course through clearing and converting to medicine as a postgrad degree. If you decide Clearing is not for you, then retaking your exams may be an option but, because medicine is such a competitive degree, you should check with the universities you're interested in to see what their view is on retakes. We always recommend students are around when receiving their A-level results but, since you're abroad, you should definitely call up your school or college and chat through your options with them too.Helena I am sorry to hear you didn't get the grades you needed for your first choice course. If you are not sure of your results I would suggest the first step is to contact your school or college to confirm exactly what you got. There may be options through clearing, but take your time and make sure any places you are offered are what you really want. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the options available to you too, so I would suggest you start there.  I am sure you will find an option that's right for you.Cath My results are higher than expected. I had accepted a place at Teesside but now have the choice to go to a different university to do the same course. Would it be better to change? Melanie Hi Melanie, Well done on your results. Take a little time to think about your options.  You can have a look to see if there are any places available at other universitiesthrough the adjustment process.,externalLook through the opportunities available and talk it through with someone. Consider the pros and cons of your current option and any new options. Good luck! I am sure you will come to the best decision for you and your career plans.Cath Hi Melanie, Congratulations on achieving brilliant results. You have the option toapply for a new uni place through UCAS adjustment,externalbut whether you do this is entirely a personal decision. Just because you can, does not necessarily mean you should. Most likely you've already researched your confirmed choice of uni and visited it on an open day, so you have probably put a lot of thought into this course already. If you haven't gone into school, I would suggest going in and chatting through your options with a teacher or careers adviser.Research the new uni course,externalas much as you can and, if possible try to visit the university or city this weekend. Some unis will have open days the weekend after results day. Bear in mind you have five days from results day to use adjustment, so you have to act fairly quickly, but try not to panic and rush a decision where you're not fully informed. Best of luck!Helena All students in my son's class were projected As or Bs in music A-level but received Cs and Ds. Given that everyone failed to reach projected grades suggests that something is wrong somewhere. Is there a process available that would allow us to question the marking? Peter Hi Peter, I am sorry to hear that your son's result in music wasn't what he expected. Your son's school or college will be best placed to advise you on a review of marking. If all the results were not what they were expecting, they may already be looking at this. I hope that this result doesn't impact on your son's plans and wish him well for his future.Cath Your son should speak to his schoolabout appealing against his grade, based on the results he's achieved,externaland his future aspirations. Inquiries can take a few different forms, from a clerical recheck to access to scripts. The school will be able to pursue this further on his behalf, should appealing be deemed the best step forward.Helena Basically I have failed biology and chemistry. I heard I might be able to retake in November. Is this true? Umar, London Hello!  I am sorry to hear that your results didn't go the way you had planned.  I would suggest that you contact your school or college about retake opportunities. They will be best placed to advise on retaking your exams and on any other options available to you to help you achieve your career aims.Cath Sorry to hear you didn't get the results you were hoping for. If you haven't already, I would recommend going into your school or college and talking to your teachers or careers advisers. Under the new A-level system, retakes occur at the following May or June, but your school should be able to confirm this depending on their retakes policy. If you want to understand more about what options you have after failing an exam, take a look at our advice guide.Helena The exams were taken in May and June I have received my A-level results for biology, chemistry and maths and my grades are AAB instead of the A*A*A I had been predicted. I would really like to see my papers or order a review. What would you advise me to do? Abdi Sorry to hear you haven't got the results you wanted, but try not to panic. If you would like to appeal against any of your grades, you'll need to speak to your school about this. For example, a careers adviser or the head of your department or sixth form. They'll be able to discuss your options in light of your results to help you figure out the best next steps, and if necessary action an appeal for you. It's not something you can do on your own. Take a look at Which? University's full guide to appealing against an A-level grade,externalfor more information around this. In the meantime, see if there are any courses in clearing which meet the grades you have achieved. There may be a vacant spot at a uni for the same, or similar, course, that is right for you.Helena Hello! First of all well done! AAB are very good results. If you would like to see your papers or order a review I would suggest that you contact your school or college. They will be best placed to advise you on the next steps. In the meantime, good luck in your future plans.Cath I did not achieve my predicted A-level grades. I got BBC instead of ABB which I needed. So I didn't get into my first choice university. I have been accepted into my second choice for a foundation year but I am quite disappointed. I was wondering whether I could switch from foundation to a better university or if retaking one A-level, which is what I am most keen on, would be better. Tash Hi Tash, These are good results, so well done. Take time to consider your options. You might want to speak to a careers adviser at your school or college. They will be able to advise about the retake option. You can also look atopportunities through clearing.,externalGood luck and don't rush to make a decision.Cath The thing about making a university your first or insurance choice is that you're making a commitment to go there should you get the grades for it. However, that doesn't mean you'll be dragged, kicking and screaming, to take it. You'll need to contact your insurance choice and ask them to formally release you, so youcan enter clearing to find an alternative.,externalGet on the phone to them, with your Ucas ID, and have a cup of tea handy in case you need to wait on the line, and speak to them about it. Regarding retaking an A-level, it's best to discuss this with your school - for example, a careers adviser, or head of department or sixth form. They know you best and can properly advise you based on what grades you've achieved and what you're hoping to go on to do, plus they'll have been through this many times before and will have policies on resits in place.Helena A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades Why clearing 'is not the end of the world"" What was new about this year's A-levels?

Murdered officers' names put on bonfire,"This video can not be played The bonfire signs were 'absolutely sickening', said the family of one of the officers Families of murdered police and prison officers have expressed disgust after their loved ones' names were burnt on a bonfire in Londonderry. Boards bearing the names of four men were placed on the bonfire in the city's Bogside. Poppy wreaths were also put on the bonfire, which was lit on Wednesday night. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was investigating the bonfire as a hate crime. The bonfire was lit on Wednesday night Three petrol bombs were thrown at police in the area of the city's famous walls. A 35-year-old man has been charged with making, possessing and throwing a petrol bomb and is due to appear in court next month. Allow Twitter content?

Bonfires on 15 August are traditional in some nationalist parts of Northern Ireland to mark the Catholic Feast of the Assumption. To others, they are lit to commemoratethe introduction of internment without trial of republican suspects,external, which was introduced by the government in 1971. The names of police officer Stephen Carroll and prison officer David Black were among those that were added to the bonfire. PC Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon in County Armagh in March 2009. His widow Kate Carroll said she was ""shocked and disappointed"" to hear that his name had been burnt. ""Stephen wasn't bigoted or bitter,"" she said. ""No-one can hurt Stephen any more - I try not to let things like this upset me."" PC Stephen Carroll was the first police officer to be killed after the formation of the PSNI David Black was shot and killed on the M1as he drove to work in November 2012. In Junehis son Kyle Black spoke about how he drove past the scene of his father's murderjust moments after the shooting, unaware of what had happened. On Wednesday he said he was ""absolutely sickened"" that boards bearing the names of his father and other men were being burnt. ""My dad, along with the other brave men named, served their community with dignity and respect,"" he tweeted. ""This in complete contrast to those responsible for this."" Controversy about bonfires invariably arisesduring the summer in Northern Ireland. Loyalist bonfires on the Eleventh Night in July and republican bonfires in mid-August have been the subject of concerns, both on safety grounds and with regards to the flags and symbols placed on them. Dissident republicans, who are opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process, have been accused of using bonfires to try to stir tensions. David Black's name was one of those painted on boards and placed on the bonfire PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said it ""sticks in my throat"" that the names of two of his former colleagues were burnt on the Bogside bonfire. He added: ""I have to weigh up if it's safe or reasonable to ask my police officers to climb a structure."" Fergal Leonard of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters arrived at the bonfire because ""we knew there were risks"" as thousands of people watched it burn. ""We knew we had to protect lives and buildings - the bonfire was at one point 10 to 15 metres away from the nearest building,"" he added. The bonfire was just a few hundred metres away from a smaller one that had no flags, emblems or messages. The smaller structure was in the grounds of Gasyard Park and was part of a community carnival marking the end of a festival in the area. A smaller bonfire without flags or emblems was built a short distance away as part of a festival Politicians in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland criticised those behind the bigger bonfire. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was ""appalled and saddened by this hatred"", while Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley condemned ""this type of offensive and sickening behaviour."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""totally appalled"", adding that community workers had tried to stop the signs being added to it. Mayor of Derry John Boyle said the large bonfire was ""certainly not reflective of the people of the Bogside"". Last week a sign mocking the death of the father of a victims' campaigner was placed on a bonfire in Newry in County Down. Willie Frazer's father Bertie was killed in an IRA gun attack in 1975. Police said they were investigating it as a hate incidentand politicians from the main Stormont parties criticised those behind it.

"Rugby star Danny Cipriani fined for assaultThe England rugby international is fined Â£2,000 after admitting assault and resisting arrest.Jersey","This video can not be played Cipriani leaves Jersey court after assault charge England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been fined Â£2,000 after an assault in a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester player pleaded guilty to common assault and resisting arrest and was ordered to pay Â£250 compensation to a woman police officer. She has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill. Three other charges - assault on police, larceny and being disorderly on licensed premises - were dropped. More stories from the Channel Islands Ciprianitweeted,externalhe was ""truly sorry... most importantly [to] the police"" and was ""mortified"" by his actions. The 30-year-old fly-half has seven days to pay the fine and compensation or face 10 weeks in prison. The officer has been named in reports as former Welsh international footballer Jodie Botterill Defence advocate Mike Preston told Jersey Magistrates' Court Cipriani was sorry for the ""confusing situation"" and was ""mortified if he harmed the police officer in any way"". Mr Preston said Cipriani ""had too many drinks"" at Drift nightclub in The Royal Yacht Hotel, St Helier, and police were called when he tried to grab a body camera off a doorman. Mr Preston argued his client did this because fame had made him more sensitive to being filmed and he was confused by the situation. He was later picked up by police but managed to escape from his cuffs and a second officer was needed to restrain him. Police were called after Cipriani tried to grab a doorman's body camera at Drift nightclub Cipriani is said to have sworn at the officer, telling her to get off him. The court heard she was left with bruises on her bicep and red marks on her neck. The former Wasps and Sale stand-off did not think he had done anything wrong at the time and did not understand why the police had been called, the court was told. The club is part of The Royal Yacht Hotel in St Helier He was in Jersey with his club as part of a pre-season tour and was supported in court by Gloucester team captain Willi Heinz. Cipriani, who moved to Kingsholm in the summer, is due to make his debut in a friendly against Ulster on Saturday. In response to his player's guilty plea, Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan commented: ""We will deal with it in a robust but balanced way but based purely on the facts. ""As a high-profile sportsperson there is often a large degree of public and media scrutiny involved, which Danny is well aware of. ""The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved. ""He knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club. However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support.""

Last week Cipriani vowed to ""do everything"" to remain in the England set-up after making his first Test match start in 10 years during the summer tour to South Africa. He was dropped from the national side in 2008 - the same year he won his first cap - after visiting a nightclub prior to a match against Scotland. In 2011, Cipriani was fined by his then club Melbourne Rebels for taking a bottle of vodka from a nightclub and later in the same year served a one-match ban for breaking a team curfew. Four years later he was banned for driving for 18 months and ordered to pay fines and costs totalling Â£7,620 after being found to be nearly twice the drink-drive limit. Cipriani has played 16 times for England since his international debut in 2008 Over the last year or so the rugby had really been doing the talking for Danny Cipriani. Many thought he wouldn't get a look in under Eddie Jones but Jones recalled him for the tour of South Africa in June. He kept his head down, worked extremely hard on the tour, got a start in the third Test and set up the try which led to an England victory. I think in terms of his club future, Gloucester will put it down as an incident they can move on from. At the moment, England are staying very tight-lipped. It's pretty hard to second guess Eddie Jones' position. In the past, Jones has said that what happens on club duty is not to do with him and that if someone behaves themselves on and off the field in an England camp, that's what he's interested in. On the tour of South Africa, Cipriani's behaviour was exemplary and Jones made a big point of saying that before selecting Cipriani for the third Test. But with the World Cup on the horizon, no England players can afford slip-ups, let alone players whose behaviour in the past has been called into question. Cipriani just had to keep his head down. He was probably in the best place he's been in for a decade. Gloucester were saying Cipriani had been worked extremely hard in pre-season and that he'd been a fantastic addition to the club. Up until Tuesday night, things were going swimmingly. He must just feel so disappointed with himself. His international future is now hanging by a thread.

Mail redirection fees 'penalise' modern families,"Many families have more than one surname, sometimes as a result of one spouse choosing not to change their name after marriage Royal Mail has agreed to change how it charges for its redirection service, after claims it currently discriminates against many modern families. Citizens Advice said the service was ""designed for households of the past"" as it charged for each surname rather than by household. This penalised families with multiple surnames, including unmarried partners and many same-sex married couples, the watchdog said. Royal Mail is finalising new fees. Currently, householders pay an upfront fee based on the length of time they want to use the service, with three packages ranging from Â£33.99 per surname for three months to Â£66.99 for 12 months. Adding the cost of just one additional surname makes the service more expensive than in any other country, Citizens Advice said. It also found that, since 2012, the price of a three-month redirection had increased by 74%, while second-class stamps had only gone up 12%. Claire Worrall, 35, a medical doctor and researcher based in Oxford, told BBC News she felt Royal Mail needed to move with the times. ""I chose not to take my husband's name, feeling it was outdated, and also as a researcher I wanted to retain the name I have been published under,"" she said. ""We recently moved and chose to use the Royal Mail redirection service. At no point was it made clear we would be charged more for having different surnames. It came to around Â£67 for three months. ""It should be changed as this is not the way of the world anymore and I don't see how it costs Royal Mail double."" Of 4,000 people surveyed by Citizens Advice, 26% said the price was one of the reasons they did not use the service last time they moved. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Many people rely on Royal Mail's redirection service, yet it's designed for households of the past. ""Consumers are facing a double whammy. ""Royal Mail has drastically increased the price of redirection over the years but hasn't changed its outdated price structure that assumes families always share the same surname. ""As the dedicated universal service provider, it has a duty to make sure this service is fair and affordable."" Royal Mail agreed there was a need for a different pricing system. ""We will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar,"" a spokesman for Royal Mail said. ""We are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share it once it is finalised.""

Arrest after 'mass overdose' in US park,"More than 40 people have overdosed in a park near Yale University since Tuesday Police have made three arrests after more than 70 people overdosed in a Connecticut city. Some 52 of the 71 overdoses happened on New Haven's downtown green, next to Yale University's campus, said Fire Chief John Alston. The first three overdoses were reported on Tuesday night and the tally steadily rose throughout Wednesday, officials said. New Haven officials said the substance was K2, a synthetic cannabinoid. The incident comes in the wake of a new report that found a record 72,000 Americans died of overdoses in 2017. One man arrested on Wednesday is suspected of a connection to some of the drugs that caused the overdoses,NBC News Connecticut reported,external. Dr Kathryn Hawk, an Emergency Department physician at Yale New Haven Hospital, said the K2 may have been laced with fentanyl, a potent painkiller, but police have yet to confirm this. The 100 words that triggered the opioid crisis Opioid addiction mail-ordered to your door Five ways to tackle the US drug epidemic No one has died, but two individuals were in a critical condition. On Tuesday night, emergency crews responded to three overdoses in New Haven Green park. Eighteen people collapsed on Wednesday morning within a span of three-and-a-half hours, officials said. Some of the people were unconscious - others were vomiting, hallucinating or experiencing high blood pressure and shallow breathing.

The slew of overdoses comes as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) publisheda preliminary report,externalon Wednesday on the record number of American drug deaths. According to the estimates, drugs - particularly fentanyl - are now deadlier in the US than HIV, car crashes and guns. Synthetic opiates like fentanyl, which is 30-50 times more potent than heroin, are extremely dangerous. Just 2mg of fentanyl - the equivalent of a few grains of table salt - is a lethal dosage for most people, and even exposure can cause a fatal reaction, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Fentanyl is approved as an anaesthetic and for pain relief, but its high profit margin for traffickers has made it a key drug in the US opioid crisis. The CDC reported that between 2015 and 2016, the rate of drug overdose deaths in the US involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl had doubled. In New Haven, Fire Chief John Alston Jr told reporters the opiate problem is a far-reaching one. ""People are self-medicating for several different reasons and every agency - police, fire, medical, hospitals - all are strained at this time,"" Chief Alston said.

Kim Jong-nam murder case to go to trial,"Doan Thi Huong (in yellow T-shirt) and Siti Aisyah (right) have said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank Two women who say they were tricked into killing the half-brother of North Korea's Kim Jong-un will go on trial. Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Thuong are accused of smearing the toxic nerve agent VX on Kim Jong-nam's face in Kuala Lumpur airport last year. But they deny murder, saying they were told they taking part in a TV prank. A judge said there was enough evidence to suggest they knew what they were doing. They could face the death penalty if convicted. Four North Korean men also charged over the murder are still at large. Mr Kim, the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-un, had been waiting to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau on 13 February last year when two women approached him in the departure area. CCTV footage shows one woman placing her hands over his face before she and the other woman leave the scene. The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam The unravelling of Kim Jong-nam's mysterious death What is the deadly nerve agent VX? Mr Kim is then seen seeking medical help - he told staff a chemical had been sprayed on him. He died on the way to hospital from what was later found to have been exposure to the VX, one of the most toxic of all known chemical agents. Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam - both in their 20s - have said they were innocent victims of an elaborate North Korean plot. ""She knows nothing, she was fooled. The case was made up,"" Ms Aisyah's father told AFP on Thursday. Their lawyers say that in the days before Mr Kim's death, the women had been paid to take part in pranks where they wiped liquid on people at airports, hotels and shopping malls. They thought the airport was just another prank. Their lawyers had expressed confidence that the court would see they had no motive to kill Mr Kim. Kim Jong-nam (pictured in 2001) was late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's oldest son But Judge Azmi Ariffin said there was enough evidence to suggest it was ""a well-planned conspiracy between the women and the four North Koreans at large"". He said there was no hidden crew and no attempt to bring the target in on the joke afterwards, and that the footage ""showed that they had the knowledge that the liquid on their hands was toxic"". They will now go on trial for murder and could be hanged if found guilty. Kim Jong-nam was the older half-brother of North Korea's authoritarian ruler Kim Jong-un. He was once seen as a future leader of the isolated country, but when his father died, was bypassed in favour of the younger Kim. Kim Jong-un: The king of Pyongyang Stop romanticising a dictator, say N Koreans He was largely estranged from the family, and spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities. North Korea has fiercely denied any involvement in the killing. Four men - believed to be North Koreans who left Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case, but have not been found. Judge Azmi Ariffin said on Thursday: ""I cannot rule out that this could be a political assassination. Despite that, I am unable to confirm this fact.""

Murdered officers' names put on bonfireFamilies express disgust as boards bearing the names are burned alongside poppy wreaths in Londonderry.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played The bonfire signs were 'absolutely sickening', said the family of one of the officers Families of murdered police and prison officers have expressed disgust after their loved ones' names were burnt on a bonfire in Londonderry. Boards bearing the names of four men were placed on the bonfire in the city's Bogside. Poppy wreaths were also put on the bonfire, which was lit on Wednesday night. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was investigating the bonfire as a hate crime. The bonfire was lit on Wednesday night Three petrol bombs were thrown at police in the area of the city's famous walls. A 35-year-old man has been charged with making, possessing and throwing a petrol bomb and is due to appear in court next month. Allow Twitter content?

Bonfires on 15 August are traditional in some nationalist parts of Northern Ireland to mark the Catholic Feast of the Assumption. To others, they are lit to commemoratethe introduction of internment without trial of republican suspects,external, which was introduced by the government in 1971. The names of police officer Stephen Carroll and prison officer David Black were among those that were added to the bonfire. PC Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon in County Armagh in March 2009. His widow Kate Carroll said she was ""shocked and disappointed"" to hear that his name had been burnt. ""Stephen wasn't bigoted or bitter,"" she said. ""No-one can hurt Stephen any more - I try not to let things like this upset me."" PC Stephen Carroll was the first police officer to be killed after the formation of the PSNI David Black was shot and killed on the M1as he drove to work in November 2012. In Junehis son Kyle Black spoke about how he drove past the scene of his father's murderjust moments after the shooting, unaware of what had happened. On Wednesday he said he was ""absolutely sickened"" that boards bearing the names of his father and other men were being burnt. ""My dad, along with the other brave men named, served their community with dignity and respect,"" he tweeted. ""This in complete contrast to those responsible for this."" Controversy about bonfires invariably arisesduring the summer in Northern Ireland. Loyalist bonfires on the Eleventh Night in July and republican bonfires in mid-August have been the subject of concerns, both on safety grounds and with regards to the flags and symbols placed on them. Dissident republicans, who are opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process, have been accused of using bonfires to try to stir tensions. David Black's name was one of those painted on boards and placed on the bonfire PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said it ""sticks in my throat"" that the names of two of his former colleagues were burnt on the Bogside bonfire. He added: ""I have to weigh up if it's safe or reasonable to ask my police officers to climb a structure."" Fergal Leonard of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters arrived at the bonfire because ""we knew there were risks"" as thousands of people watched it burn. ""We knew we had to protect lives and buildings - the bonfire was at one point 10 to 15 metres away from the nearest building,"" he added. The bonfire was just a few hundred metres away from a smaller one that had no flags, emblems or messages. The smaller structure was in the grounds of Gasyard Park and was part of a community carnival marking the end of a festival in the area. A smaller bonfire without flags or emblems was built a short distance away as part of a festival Politicians in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland criticised those behind the bigger bonfire. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was ""appalled and saddened by this hatred"", while Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley condemned ""this type of offensive and sickening behaviour."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""totally appalled"", adding that community workers had tried to stop the signs being added to it. Mayor of Derry John Boyle said the large bonfire was ""certainly not reflective of the people of the Bogside"". Last week a sign mocking the death of the father of a victims' campaigner was placed on a bonfire in Newry in County Down. Willie Frazer's father Bertie was killed in an IRA gun attack in 1975.

Drug 'may cut need for liver transplants',"A potential treatment for sudden liver failure could cut the need for transplants, say scientists at the University of Edinburgh. The liver has an incredible natural ability to repair itself, but this can be lost in some injuries including severe drug overdoses. The therapy is a cancer drug that restores this regenerative potential. The work is at a very early stage, but the team say alternatives to transplant would have a huge impact on patients. Around 200 people in the UK have sudden life-threatening liver failure each year. Student nurse Kara Watt, 21, needed a liver transplant two years ago. She was on placement at a care home when she started to feel sick and her face started to go yellow. Tests identified a problem with her liver function which continued to get worse. Kara needed a liver transplant two year ago She ended up in intensive care in Edinburgh and was told she needed a new liver. It was ""a horrible, horrible thing to hear"", she said. It is people like Kara whom scientists hope their work will ultimately help. The team started by examining people's livers to see why they lose their ability to regenerate. They discovered severe injuries rapidly triggered a process called senescence throughout the liver. Senescence is when the body's cells become old, tired and stop working properly. It is part of ageing, but the researchers showed severe injuries were like ""contagious old age"" spreading through the organ. The study,published in Science Translational Medicine,external, also found a chemical signal that seemed to be responsible. The researchers then turned to mice and an experimental cancer therapy that could block the signal. Fasting diet 'regenerates diabetic pancreas' Whole organ 'grown' in world first Scientists make 'laboratory-grown' kidney The animals were given a drug overdose that would normally lead to liver failure and death, but with the treatment they survived. The researchers plan to test the drug on patients soon in the hope it could reduce the need for liver transplants. Dr Thomas Bird, one of the researchers at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""The beauty of this clinically is even if you have massive injury, if the liver is regrown then you have a normal life after that. ""The most obvious thing to is to do now is clinical trials in patients with acute liver failure and see if we can prevent the need for transplant."" This could reduce pressures on the organ transplant list, but also make a difference to the lives of patients. Kara is currently taking 13 tablets a day, mostly to prevent her body rejecting her new liver. She said ""If that treatment could help people it would be so beneficial."" The research group, which also includes the Beatson Institute in Glasgow, is also investigating whether senescence spreads beyond only the liver and could be part of the explanation for multiple organ failure. Lindsay Keir, from the Wellcome Trust, said the study was ""important"". She added: ""The research so far suggests that a medication could be used to treat this condition, avoiding the need for a liver transplant which is a major operation and reducing the demand on the limited supply of livers available for transplant.""

Stormzy launches Cambridge scholarshipThe grime MC is helping to fund two black students going to Cambridge this year.Newsbeat,"Stormzy with his old teachers from Harris Academy in Crystal Palace Stormzy has announced that he will fund two black British students to go to the University of Cambridge. The Stormzy Scholarship will pay for tuition fees and provide a maintenance grant for up to four years of an undergraduate course. The rapper says: ""It's so important for black students, especially, to be aware that it can 100% be an option to attend a university of this calibre."" The rapper will fund two students this year and two in 2019. Stormzy with Cambridge University students Explaining why he set up the scholarship, Stormzy tells Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""In school and college I had the ability and was almost destined to go to one of the top universities. ""But that didn't happen for myself... so hopefully there's another young black student out there that can have that opportunity through my scholarship."" He adds: ""I always said that there's a whole bunch of academically brilliant, excellent students who also need an incentive."" This video can not be played A picture of 14 black male students at Cambridge went viral last year Cambridge has been criticised for not admitting many pupils from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. In June, the universityasked for helpfrom schools and parents to increase the number of black British students it enrols. It was after the Financial Times found that some Cambridge colleges didn't take in any black students from 2012 to 2016. The university says that it admitted 58 black students on to undergraduate courses in 2017. ""We're going to have young black students who are academically brilliant and smashing it, and they should just have that opportunity to walk into a university like Cambridge,"" says Stormzy. Stormzy says he wants to help students ""pursue their dream"" of studying at Cambridge The 25-year-old announced the scheme at his old school Harris City Academy in south London on A-level results day. He didn't go to university, but did get six A*s, three As and three Bs at GCSE. ""It sounds corny coming from a rapper, but I did love learning and I loved studying so I enjoyed that side of things,"" he says.

""I didn't really know that someone that famous and that influential could come from my school,"" she says. ""I'm definitely going to apply for the scholarship because it seems like something that students who struggle with their financial situation at university may really benefit from, especially if they come form background similar to mine."" She thinks that black students are less likely to apply for universities like Cambridge because ""they see it like a really distant, alien place that they would not really thrive in"". ""But in reality, if you have the ambition and have the grades, there's no reason why someone from a similar background to mine can't apply there and be successful."" Stormzy also says that of all his achievements, ""this one in particular"" makes his mum proud. ""My mum always had this plan of 'You're going to school and college, then you're going to go Cambridge.' ""It didn't happen for me, so I feel that for me to get to this place in my career and be able to do something where we can help young black students get into Cambridge is a testimony to her hard work as well.""

"Face transplant for suicide survivorSurgeons say they have given Katie Stubblefield a ""second chance at life"" with the complex procedure.US & Canada","The procedure was carried out in May 2017 by 11 surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio Katie Stubblefield was only 18 when she was severely injured by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Her life was saved in hospital, but the young woman had life-changing injuries and had lost most of her face. Now 22, the youngest US recipient of a face transplant hasshared the results of several years of exhaustive reconstructive surgery with National Geographic magazine,external. The publication was given unprecedented access by an Ohio clinic which operated on Katie when she was just 21. A journalist and photographers followed her preparation and the results from the invasive 31-hour procedure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Story of a Face is on the cover of the magazine's September issue, and Katie's story is also told in a documentary online. There have only been 40 recipients of a face transplant throughout the world.The first full-face procedure was successfully carried out by Spanish doctors in 2010,external. But because surgery is still considered experimental, it is not covered by US insurance providers. Katie's surgery was eventually funded by the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, which wants to improve treatment of military personnel who are injured at war. Katie, now 22, was deemed a good candidate because of her age and the nature of the injuries she had sustained. The transplanted face came from 31-year-old Adrea Schneider, who died from a drug overdose in 2017. First double face transplant 'well' Transplant patient 'overwhelmed' by result What's it like living with a face transplant? She was already an organ donor, but the decision to donate her face came from her grandmother, Sandra Bennington, who has since met Katie following the surgery. Adrea's grandmother said she recognised some features of her granddaughter (L) in Katie now Katie says she cannot remember much about the period before her suicide attempt, but family say she had been struggling emotionally with moving around, a failed relationship and chronic gastrointestinal health problems throughout her teens. The bullet wound destroyed much of her face - including her nose, some of her forehead and jawbone. She also had brain injuries and significant damage to her eyes. After being initially treated in Mississippi, she was transferred to Tennessee before ending up at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - a facility already performing pioneering transplant procedures. Before the transplant, Katie had already undergone 22 reconstructive surgeries, including using her thigh and 3D printing to help reconstruct her jaw. She and her family say they did not even know what the procedure entailed when they were notified she could be eligible. ""I had no clue what a face transplant was,"" Katie said. ""When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again."" After a year on the transplant list and having two donors fall through, she eventually underwent the procedure in May 2017. Her mother Alesia (R) said her daughter wanted the surgery to not be stared at in public Initially it was supposed to be a more partial procedure, but the decision was taken to use more of the donor's face to improve the match. Since the operation, she has had three revision surgeries. More operations are likely in order to improve appearance and functionality of the face. Katie still has difficulty speaking because of the damage done to her mouth. She will have to take medication for the rest of her life to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. The young woman told National Geographic she hopes to go to college and eventually go into counselling. She has also expressed an interest in speaking to teenagers about suicide and the value of life. ""So many people have helped me; now I want to help other people,"" she said. Dr Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, said Katie had received the ""ultimate second chance"",externalthrough the procedure, CNN reports. ""My first wish for Katie is to be happy,"" Mr Gastman said. ""That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy. ""Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects - for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are.""

New Zealand bans house sales to foreignersThe move is aimed at cooling house prices and making properties more affordable to New Zealanders.,"New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis New Zealand's parliament has banned many foreigners from buying existing homes in the country - a move aimed at making properties more affordable. The ban only applies to non-residents. Australians and Singaporeans are exempt because of free-trade deals. New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis which has left home ownership out of reach for many. Low interest rates, limited housing stock and immigration have driven up prices in recent years. US applications for New Zealand citizenship jump 70% after election The lure of New Zealand for jaded Americans China's New Zealand farm-buying runs into opposition No, only non-residents are affected by the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill, which was passed in a 63-57 vote on Wednesday. They are now banned from purchasing most types of homes - but they will be able to make limited investments in new apartments in large developments. Foreigners with residency status in New Zealand - as well as non-resident Australian and Singaporean nationals - are not affected by the ban. This video can not be played David Parker: ""It's the right of people who live permanently in our country... to buy our homes"" New Zealand's Trade and Economic Development Minister David Parker described the passage of the bill as a ""significant milestone"". ""This government believes that New Zealanders should not be outbid by wealthier foreign buyers,"" he said. ""Whether it's a beautiful lakeside or ocean-front estate, or a modest suburban house, this law ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international market."" But opponents said the ban was unnecessary and would not fix any problem. Foreign ownership and a housing shortage in New Zealand's bigger cities were prominent issues in the run-up tolast year's election, which saw the end of nine years of rule by the conservative National Party. New Zealand now has a centre-left coalition government led by Labour's Jacinda Ardern, the country's youngest female leader. The ban follows fears that overseas buyers of homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices. Many foreigners are drawn to New Zealand's natural attractions such as Mount Cook Chinese investors have been among the biggest and most active offshore buyers of property in the New Zealand market. Also, some wealthy Americans - like Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel - have become New Zealand citizens or have bought property in the country. Average prices in New Zealand have risen more than 60% in the past 10 years, while in Auckland - the country's largest city - they have almost doubled. However, the housing market has somewhat cooled in recent months.

Brazil's 'Dr Bumbum' charged with murder,"Dr Furtado described the death as a ""tragic accident"" A celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon known as Dr Bumbum has been charged with murdering one of his patients. Dr Denis Furtado performed an operation on patient Lilian Calixto to enlarge her buttocks in his own flat, helped by his mother, girlfriend and maid. He used a far larger dose of a chemical than advisable during the procedure, the charge sheet said. Moreover, he was allegedly not registered to practice medicine in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Dr Furtado is said to have carried out the procedure on Ms Calixto, a 46-year-old bank manager and mother-of-two, at his home in Rio de Janeiro last month - but she fell ill during the procedure. He then took her to a hospital where her condition worsened and she died some hours later, police said. Local media reported at the time that she arrived at the hospital suffering from an abnormally fast heart rate. Police posted a photo of Dr Furtado and his mother Maria de FÃ¡tima Barros Furtado online after their arrest The public prosecutor's office in Rio de Janeiro said the doctor ""had attracted women with the false promise of quick and immediate beauty"". He used 300ml of the substance PMMA - a synthetic resin also known as acrylic glass filler - during the procedure, the charge sheet said, ""when it is recommended that it is used only in very small doses and in a restricted way"". The Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society has warned against using PMMA for any aesthetic purposes. His flat meanwhile was prepared for surgery ""in a very provisional and precarious way"", which added to the risks. Moreover, while he was licensed to practice in the state of GoiÃ¡s and in Brasilia, he was not licensed in Rio. His mother, Maria de FÃ¡tima Barros Furtado, also faces charges. She allegedly continued to practise medicine and operate with her son after her medical license was revoked.

Social media pressure is linked to cosmetic procedure boom How safe is the cosmetic surgery boom? Dr Furtado had disappeared after the operation, butpolice caught him in July after four days on the run. His girlfriend, Renata Fernandes, had already been arrested on suspicion of taking part in the procedure. In a video posted on social media, Dr Furtado said Ms Calixto's death had been a ""fatal accident"" and said he had performed 9,000 such procedures and that they were legal in Brazil. The 45-year-old has appeared on Brazilian television and had nearly 650,000 followers on his Instagram account. In a Facebook post in July, Dr Furtado had called PMMA ""a minimally invasive procedure, offering immediate and definitive results, using local anaesthesia and therefore painless, without much need of rest after the procedure"". It is believed that Ms Calixto had booked in for this treatment.

US media launches free press campaign,"The Boston Globe made a plea for editorial unity last week More than 300 news outlets have launched a campaign to counter US President Donald Trump's attacks and promote a free press. The Boston Globe made the call last week for a nationwide denouncement of the president's ""dirty war"" against the media, using the hashtag #EnemyOfNone. Mr Trump has derided media reports as ""fake news"" and attacked journalists as ""enemies of the people"". Andhe tweeted on Thursday,external: ""The fake news media is the opposition party."" ""It is very bad for our great country... But we are winning!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UN experts have warned that Mr Trump's comments about the media raise the risk of violence against journalists. UN experts condemn Trump media attacks Why Trump attacks the media The Boston Globe had pledged to write an editorial ""on the dangers of the administration's assault on the press"" on 16 August, and asked others to do the same. This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC: How the news divides America The initial positive response from 100 news organisations has grown closer to 350 with major US national newspapers and smaller local outlets answering the call, along with international publicationslike the UK newspaper The Guardian,external. A screenshot of the New York Times' editorial Starting with theBoston Globeitself, the editorial there, headlined Journalists Are Not The Enemy, argued that a free press had been a core American principle for more than 200 years TheNew York Timeschose the headline A Free Press Needs You, calling Mr Trump's attacks ""dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy"". It published excerpts from dozens more publications beneath TheNew York Post- a pro-Trump tabloid - answered the Globe's call by saying ""Who are we to disagree?"" adding: ""It may be frustrating to argue that just because we print inconvenient truths doesn't mean that we're fake news, but being a journalist isn't a popularity contest. All we can do is to keep reporting."" But it also said: ""Will this make a difference? Not one whit"" TheTopeka Capital-Journalwas another paper to join the campaign. It said of Mr Trump's attack on the media: ""It's sinister. It's destructive. And it must end now."" The paper was one of the few to endorse Mr Trump in 2016. The fact that Mr Trump won without such media endorsements may cast doubt on whether the Globe's campaign would actually dent his support. Later on Thursday, President Trump tweeted,externalthat the Globe ""is in collusion with other papers on free press"". How Trump 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants There have been some dissenting voices to the Globe's campaign: At the conservative websiteTownhall.com,Tom Tradup panned the Globe's ""pathetic bid to pretend it is still relevant"", writing: ""I would not presume to tell anyone else what to think or what to do. But as for me - and I suspect many others - I won't be putting any coins in any newspaper box August 16th."" TheWall Street Journaldeclined to take part. An earlier piece by James Freeman argued Mr Trump was entitled to free speech, and the Globe's drive ran counter to the very independence it was seeking. By BBC's White House reporter Tara McKelvey Trust in the media has dipped to an all-time low, and Mr Trump has tapped into this well of discontent, prompting journalistic outcry. In fact ""the media"" - in popular parlance - means an amorphous blob of TV networks. Even people in flyover country, a region where voters supported Mr Trump, see individual reporters in a more nuanced way, as I've discovered. President Trump has been accused of increasing the risk of violence against journalists with his attacks Recently I was interviewing someone in a Kansas liquor store (it's a long story) and a big, burly construction worker burst in the door and shouted: ""The media!"" I looked up uneasily, and he smiled and said I was doing important work. When Mr Trump attacks ""the media"", crowds roar. In general terms, people condemn ""the media"". Privately, though, Mr Trump is chummy with us - and often asks how we're doing. And ordinary people across the US are also gracious towards journalists, showing a real appreciation for their work . A poll released on Tuesday by Quinnipiac University,externalsuggested that 51% of Republican voters now believed the media to be ""the enemy of the people rather than an important part of democracy"" and 52% of the Republican supporters polled were not concerned that Mr Trump's criticism would lead to violence against journalists. Among all voters, 65% believe the news media to be an important part of democracy, the poll suggests. An Ipsos poll, also this month, gave similar figures. In addition it found that 23% of Republicans, and about one in eight Americans overall, believed Mr Trump should close down mainstream news outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times. Mr Trump has certainly ramped up the pressure on mainstream media with numerous tweets. The Trump Twitter Archive says he has tweeted 281 times,externalso far using the term ""fake news"". When he brings up the matter at his rallies, some journalists have felt uneasy about their safety and have even avoided using designated reporter zones. Are journalists increasingly under attack? At a presidential rally in Florida in July, CNN filmed Mr Trump's supporters yelling insults and swearing at reporters covering the event. CNN presenter Jim Acosta tweeted a clip, which contained strong language. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A man was also arrested in January for making threats to CNN employees via telephone calls that referred to ""fake news"". The publisher of the New York Times, AG Sulzberger, told Mr Trump in a personal meeting in July that the president's language was ""contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence"". But most of the Globe's campaign is about maintaining a free press and its own editorial does not even touch on violence. Some outlets do, however, refer to the recent killing of five peopleat the offices of the Capital Gazette in Maryland. This, and an incident in which two journalists were killed live on air in Virginia in 2015, well before Mr Trump was elected, are used to highlight the dangers of the profession, although both were allegedly carried out by people with personal grievances.

The statement added that Mr Trump was also reviewing access to classified information for former FBI chief James Comey, whom he fired last year, former director of national intelligence James Clapper, former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden and former attorney general Sally Yates, among others. James Comeycalled the president ""morally unfit"" to lead. His memoir, A Higher Loyalty, likened Mr Trump to a mob boss.

In a naked jab at the Trump administration,Michael Haydentweeted a photo in June of a Nazi death camp with the caption: ""Other governments have separated mothers and children."" Analysis by BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel John Brennan has been an outspoken critic of the president. He called Donald Trump treasonous over his meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki; he's called him imbecilic; and a danger to the US. Now Donald Trump has had his revenge, revoking the former CIA chief's security clearance - and threatening a number of other national intelligence officials - all of whom have one thing in common: they've also been critical of the president. But in justifying this move there's been no suggestion that Mr Brennan either leaked classified material or sought to make money from it. Instead the White House statement spoke of Mr Brennan's ""erratic behaviour"", ""wild outbursts"" and ""frenzied commentary"". The decision by the president was apparently taken without consulting his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats. And the move has brought criticism. Former Secretary of State John Kerry said the president was behaving like the ruler of a banana republic. Others have said Mr Trump is trying to shut up critics. The timing is also noteworthy. The White House has been buffeted for days by claims from a disaffected former adviser to the president. Closing arguments in the trial of Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, are also being heard. The White House briefing where this was announced hadn't been scheduled.

Opt-out donation 'won't increase donors',"More than 5,000 people are currently on the waiting list for a transplant in England An opt-out organ donation register in England may not increase the number of organs because grieving relatives could be less sure what their loved ones had wanted, a study suggests. Under the opt-out system, planned to come in from 2020, consent is presumed unless family members decide otherwise. But research by Queen Mary University London surveyed attitudes in several nations with varying donation policies. NHS Blood and Transplant say the change would make families debate the subject. And it said this would support an increase in donation. The study,externalwas a psychology experiment involving a total of nearly 1,300 people from a number of different countries with different systems of organ donation, including the US, UK, Germany, Austria, Spain, France and Norway. Participants were presented with a fictional scenario and asked to judge the likelihood that an individual's ""true wish"" was to actually donate their organs, given that they were registered to donate. A donor's preference to donate was deemed to be stronger when they had chosen to opt in compared to when they were presumed to consent to donation, under an opt-out system. Transplant boy honoured by law plan Why you may wait longer if you're black It presumes that people agree to donate their organs so everyone is automatically registered as a donor. If you do not want to donate, you must make that clear on the organ donation register. In contrast, an opt-in system requires people to choose to be listed as a donor on the register. Donation rates rose in Austria, Belgium and Singapore after presumed consent was introduced. The government recently announced plans to introduce the system in England by 2020. A similar opt-out system has been in place in Wales since 2015, although two years into the schemethe number of donors had not increased in the country. Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme and Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest. Yes - opt-out and opt-in systems allow family members to have a veto and make the final decision for their deceased relative. In the last five years, NHS figures show that the families of 505 registered donors refused donation. NHSBT said this resulted in around 1,200 people missing out on potentially life-saving transplants. It is the difference between a passive choice (being automatically opted in) rather than an active choice (deciding to actively opt in), the researchers say. Also, people rarely communicate their wishes to their families on this subject and that leaves them in a quandary, and therefore more likely to say no to donation. Lead author Dr Magda Osman, from Queen Mary University of London, said: ""To help increase actual rates of organ donation, we need more transplant co-ordinators working with families to help them understand the issues before being faced with a monumental and distressing decision. ""We also need to offer people a way to indicate explicitly what they wish to do. ""This should involve an expressed statement of intention if their wish is to donate, or an expressed statement of intention if there is an objection to donate. ""This reduces the ambiguity in trying to infer what someone wanted to do when it comes to donating their organs."" Around eight in 10 people support organ donation but only around one-third of people have told their families they wish to donate their organs after they die. In 2017, 411 people in the UK died before the right donor was found. More than 5,000 people are currently on the transplant waiting list in England. A spokesman from NHS Blood and Transplant spokesman said: ""Under the new legislation, you would still be able to express a decision to opt into donation, and you would still be able to opt out. ""People who do not register a decision will be deemed to have given consent for donation.""

"Drug 'may cut need for liver transplants'A cancer drug can unlock the liver's ability to regenerate, early stage research suggests.Health","A potential treatment for sudden liver failure could cut the need for transplants, say scientists at the University of Edinburgh. The liver has an incredible natural ability to repair itself, but this can be lost in some injuries including severe drug overdoses. The therapy is a cancer drug that restores this regenerative potential. The work is at a very early stage, but the team say alternatives to transplant would have a huge impact on patients. Around 200 people in the UK have sudden life-threatening liver failure each year. Student nurse Kara Watt, 21, needed a liver transplant two years ago. She was on placement at a care home when she started to feel sick and her face started to go yellow. Tests identified a problem with her liver function which continued to get worse. Kara needed a liver transplant two year ago She ended up in intensive care in Edinburgh and was told she needed a new liver. It was ""a horrible, horrible thing to hear"", she said. It is people like Kara whom scientists hope their work will ultimately help. The team started by examining people's livers to see why they lose their ability to regenerate. They discovered severe injuries rapidly triggered a process called senescence throughout the liver. Senescence is when the body's cells become old, tired and stop working properly. It is part of ageing, but the researchers showed severe injuries were like ""contagious old age"" spreading through the organ. The study,published in Science Translational Medicine,external, also found a chemical signal that seemed to be responsible. The researchers then turned to mice and an experimental cancer therapy that could block the signal. Fasting diet 'regenerates diabetic pancreas' Whole organ 'grown' in world first Scientists make 'laboratory-grown' kidney The animals were given a drug overdose that would normally lead to liver failure and death, but with the treatment they survived. The researchers plan to test the drug on patients soon in the hope it could reduce the need for liver transplants. Dr Thomas Bird, one of the researchers at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""The beauty of this clinically is even if you have massive injury, if the liver is regrown then you have a normal life after that. ""The most obvious thing to is to do now is clinical trials in patients with acute liver failure and see if we can prevent the need for transplant."" This could reduce pressures on the organ transplant list, but also make a difference to the lives of patients. Kara is currently taking 13 tablets a day, mostly to prevent her body rejecting her new liver. She said ""If that treatment could help people it would be so beneficial."" The research group, which also includes the Beatson Institute in Glasgow, is also investigating whether senescence spreads beyond only the liver and could be part of the explanation for multiple organ failure. Lindsay Keir, from the Wellcome Trust, said the study was ""important"". She added: ""The research so far suggests that a medication could be used to treat this condition, avoiding the need for a liver transplant which is a major operation and reducing the demand on the limited supply of livers available for transplant.""

Post redirection fees 'penalise' modern families,"Many families have more than one surname, sometimes as a result of one spouse choosing not to change their name after marriage Royal Mail has agreed to change how it charges for its redirection service, after claims it currently discriminates against many modern families. Citizens Advice said the service was ""designed for households of the past"" as it charged for each surname rather than by household. This penalised families with multiple surnames, including unmarried partners and many same-sex married couples, the watchdog said. Royal Mail is finalising new fees. Currently, householders pay an upfront fee based on the length of time they want to use the service, with three packages ranging from Â£33.99 per surname for three months to Â£66.99 for 12 months. Adding the cost of just one additional surname makes the service more expensive than in any other country, Citizens Advice said. It also found that, since 2012, the price of a three-month redirection had increased by 74%, while second-class stamps had only gone up 12%. Claire Worrall, 35, a medical doctor and researcher based in Oxford, told BBC News she felt Royal Mail needed to move with the times. ""I chose not to take my husband's name, feeling it was outdated, and also as a researcher I wanted to retain the name I have been published under,"" she said. ""We recently moved and chose to use the Royal Mail redirection service. At no point was it made clear we would be charged more for having different surnames. It came to around Â£67 for three months. ""It should be changed as this is not the way of the world anymore and I don't see how it costs Royal Mail double."" Of 4,000 people surveyed by Citizens Advice, 26% said the price was one of the reasons they did not use the service last time they moved. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Many people rely on Royal Mail's redirection service, yet it's designed for households of the past. ""Consumers are facing a double whammy. ""Royal Mail has drastically increased the price of redirection over the years but hasn't changed its outdated price structure that assumes families always share the same surname. ""As the dedicated universal service provider, it has a duty to make sure this service is fair and affordable."" Royal Mail agreed there was a need for a different pricing system. ""We will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar,"" a spokesman for Royal Mail said. ""We are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share it once it is finalised.""

Cipriani due in court charged with nightclub assault,"Cipriani joined Gloucester from Wasps in the summer England rugby international Danny Cipriani has been charged with common assault after an incident at a Jersey nightclub. The Gloucester fly-half was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday on Mulcaster Street in St Helier. Police said he had been charged with common assault, larceny, assault on police, resisting arrest and being disorderly on licensed premises. The 30-year-old has been remanded in custody until a hearing on Thursday. He had been on the island with his club during a pre-season tour. Gloucester Rugby Club said they were ""aware of the incident"" and would make a further announcement in due course. Cipriani, who moved to Gloucester from fellow Premiership club Wasps in the summer, was due to make his debut with the team on Saturday. He has played 16 times for England since his international debut in 2008. Two of those caps came during England's tour of South Africa in June, with Cipriani making his first Test start for almost 10 years in the final match of the series.

Sick babies' breathing tube harm risk,"About 120,000 babies and children are admitted to paediatric or neonatal intensive care units each year Some intensive care units may be putting sick babies at risk by not monitoring breathing tubes correctly, according to a study which interviewed staff at hospitals across the country. This could lead to death or serious harm to babies from lack of oxygen, the researchers said. Doctors needed to be better prepared and have the best equipment to place breathing tubes safely, they said. The charity Bliss urged hospitals to act on the recommendations. The study,external, led by doctors at the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, interviewed staff at 27 paediatric and 129 neonatal intensive care units across the country. It found that less than half of specialist baby units had the equipment to measure carbon dioxide (capnography) coming from the lungs. Measuring this gas helps doctors work out if the tube is in the correct position in the airway, and not the throat. In contrast, units dealing with older babies and children were found to be routinely measuring carbon dioxide. The researchers found that without proper monitoring, death or serious harm during intubation had occurred in 26% of the neonatal units and 19% of the paediatric units in the past five years - equivalent to 34 neonatal units and five paediatric units. About 120,000 babies and children are admitted to paediatric or neonatal intensive care units each year in the UK. While doctors who place airways in children are highly trained, patients can sometimes have differences in the anatomy of mouth and airway that makes the process of intubating more challenging. Prof Tim Cook, one of the authors of the study, said: ""We hope that the neonatal units where capnography is already being used can share best practice with other colleagues to help implement this important technology more widely. ""In the case of low-weight neonates, more research is needed to establish whether measuring carbon dioxide is useful and improves care."" Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive of the premature and sick baby charity Bliss, said: ""It is extremely important that the recommendations of this crucial research are taken on board by NHS trusts across the country in order to ensure that babies on neonatal units receive the highest possible standard of care. ""The forthcomingNHS England Neonatal Review,externalshould incorporate these recommendations as part of its wider programme to improve staffing and consistency of care across neonatal units."" Neonatologist Dr Helen Mactier, speaking on behalf of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it was important to identify the best equipment for monitoring preterm babies needing intubation. ""It is not clear from the study if centres that deal with higher risk pregnancies were better prepared than low risk birth units,"" she said. ""Antenatal identification of women whose baby might need intensive care helps to ensure they are cared for in a unit that is best equipped to deal with sick babies needing intubation.""

New Zealand bans house sales to foreigners,"New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis New Zealand's parliament has banned many foreigners from buying existing homes in the country - a move aimed at making properties more affordable. The ban only applies to non-residents. Australians and Singaporeans are exempt because of free-trade deals. New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis which has left home ownership out of reach for many. Low interest rates, limited housing stock and immigration have driven up prices in recent years. US applications for New Zealand citizenship jump 70% after election The lure of New Zealand for jaded Americans China's New Zealand farm-buying runs into opposition No, only non-residents are affected by the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill, which was passed in a 63-57 vote on Wednesday. They are now banned from purchasing most types of homes - but they will be able to make limited investments in new apartments in large developments. Foreigners with residency status in New Zealand - as well as non-resident Australian and Singaporean nationals - are not affected by the ban. This video can not be played David Parker: ""It's the right of people who live permanently in our country... to buy our homes"" New Zealand's Trade and Economic Development Minister David Parker described the passage of the bill as a ""significant milestone"". ""This government believes that New Zealanders should not be outbid by wealthier foreign buyers,"" he said. ""Whether it's a beautiful lakeside or ocean-front estate, or a modest suburban house, this law ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international market."" But opponents said the ban was unnecessary and would not fix any problem. Foreign ownership and a housing shortage in New Zealand's bigger cities were prominent issues in the run-up tolast year's election, which saw the end of nine years of rule by the conservative National Party. New Zealand now has a centre-left coalition government led by Labour's Jacinda Ardern, the country's youngest female leader. The ban follows fears that overseas buyers of homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices. Many foreigners are drawn to New Zealand's natural attractions such as Mount Cook Chinese investors have been among the biggest and most active offshore buyers of property in the New Zealand market. Also, some wealthy Americans - like Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel - have become New Zealand citizens or have bought property in the country. Average prices in New Zealand have risen more than 60% in the past 10 years, while in Auckland - the country's largest city - they have almost doubled. However, the housing market has somewhat cooled in recent months. In July, the median price for residential property nationwide was NZ$550,000 ($360,500; Â£284,000),according to data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.,external In June, about 82% of houses were bought by New Zealand's citizens or residents, with fewer than 3% of homes going to foreigners.

Corona beer firm pours $4bn into weed,"There are nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme Corona beer owner Constellation Brands is set to pour some $4bn (Â£3.15bn) into Canada's top cannabis producer, Canopy Growth, in a deal marking the largest investment in the industry to date. Last year, Constellation injected $200m into Canopy in a deal to produce a non-alcoholic cannabis-based beverage. The alcohol firm wants to capitalise on the growing legalisation of the drug. On news of the deal, Canopy's Toronto-listed stock surged 30%, while on Wall Street, Constellation's fell 6%. The two firms said the investment would allow Canopy to expand its business reach""in the nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme"",external. Canopy,which has the largest legal cannabis production footprint in the world,external, currently produces cannabis-based oils and soft gel caps, among other products. Cannabis debate: What you need to know Medical cannabis products to be legalised Hague's 'legalise cannabis' call rejected With Constellation's latest injection of cash, Canopy plans to expand its suite of products to include edible bars, inhalers and pre-rolled items. It also wants to develop cannabinoid-based medicines that provide a safer alternative to some mainstream treatments for pain, anxiety, sleeplessness and psoriasis. ""This [deal] marks the end of the warm-up in our sector... it's fully go-time,"" said Canopy's chief executive Bruce Linton on an investment call. Constellation, which makes and markets beer, wine and spirits in the US, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Italy, noted that governments around the world had already signalled a significant change in attitudes towards cannabis and cannabis-based products. ""Over the past year, we've come to better understand the cannabis market, the tremendous growth opportunity it presents, and Canopy's market-leading capabilities in this space,""said  Rob Sands, chief executive of Constellation Brands,external. In June, the Canadian government passed a bill which will effectively legalise the recreational cannabis market in the country. The bill is set to be rolled out in October. Constellation's latest investment in Canopy takes its ownership in the firm to 38%. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be closed no earlier than the end of October.

State of emergency follows bridge tragedy,"This video can not be played Nicola and Lisa Henton-Mitchell narrowly escaped the Genoa bridge collapse with their two children. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte has declared a 12-month state of emergency in the Liguria region in response to the motorway bridge collapse in Genoa. He also said he would make an initial â¬5m ($5.7m) available from central funds to the north-western region. The regional government had requested the action following Tuesday's disaster, which left 39 people dead. There has been anger and disbelief in Italy that such a vital structure could have simply given way. Rescuers have said there is little hope of finding more survivors underneath the Morandi bridge, where dozens of vehicles fell from a height of 45m (148ft) in Tuesday morning's collapse. What we know so far What could have made the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse The cause is not yet known but there has been heavy criticism of the private company responsible for operating the bridge. Hundreds of firefighters worked overnight and throughout Wednesday with lifting gear, climbing equipment and sniffer dogs to try to locate survivors and bodies. More than 400 people have been evacuated from the area. Residents of housing blocks under one pillar were ready to move back, but were then told it was cracking and that their homes were at risk. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing There are 15 people being treated in hospital, nine of them in a serious condition, according to the local prefecture. Giovanni Toti, governor of Liguria, had asked the government in Rome to declare a state of emergency in the region. Following a cabinet meeting held in the city of Genoa, Prime Minister Conte said: ""We agreed to his request to declare a state of emergency in Ligura for 12 months due to the events of yesterday morning... and we decided to release â¬5m from the national emergency fund for immediate needs."" He announced a national day of mourning would take place, which the government wanted ""to coincide with the funerals of the victims"". He added: ""These are unacceptable tragedies that should not happen in a modern society. This government will do everything to prevent such tragedies from happening again."" Mr Conte confirmed the government's intention to begin proceedings to revoke the contract of private sector firm Autostrade per l'Italia, which was in charge of operating and maintaining the bridge and the A10 motorway it was part of. The highways firm defended its maintenance record, saying it had checked the bridge every three months using highly specialised techniques. They included families in their cars, people going to work, and people going on holiday. Most of them were Italians, but the French foreign ministry said four of its nationals had also died. Among the dead were a family of three - Roberto Robbiano, 44, Ersilia Piccinino, 41, and their young son Samuel. Read more:The victims of the Genoa Bridge collapse One of the most compelling testimonies came from Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari. His car fell 30m in the collapse, but came to rest in a pocket between the columns and he survived. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said. Valentina Galbusera, 43, a doctor, told La Stampa,external: ""The bridge fell in front of me, not even 20m away, I avoided the collapse by only a couple of seconds. I felt the bridge was shaking and I tried to reverse. Then I got out of the car and started running."" It's not yet clear. There was torrential rainfall at the time. A huge tower and sections of the bridge - measuring about 200m - collapsed on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The motorway operator said work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time. Autostrade per l'Italia said in 2011 the bridge had been suffering from degradation due to heavy traffic. The Genoa Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into possible negligent homicide. The head prosecutor blamed ""human error"". The state of the bridge and the responses to the collapse throw light on what has been a long-standing debate about Italian infrastructure. This was the fifth bridge collapse in Italy in five years,according to Corriere Della Sera,external. There have been previous reports and comments questioning how the Morandi bridge was built and how long it could last. In December 2012, the Genoa city council discussed the state of the bridge at a public hearing into how to expand the local transport infrastructure. A local industry confederation official spoke of the collapse of the Morandi bridge ""in 10 years"". In 2016, structural engineer Antonio Brencich spoke of ""errors in this bridge"". The issue of transport in the area is now critical, given that the bridge was a major arterial route for an important port city. The Morandi bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, an important conduit for goods traffic from local ports which also serves the Italian Riviera and south-east coast of France. The prime minister has said all infrastructure across the country will be double-checked in the wake of the collapse.

The destruction caused by our love of vanilla," A barefoot farmer is making his way through a forest. Quiet drops of rain tumble steadily through the night, picked out in the light from his torch. The rusty machete he holds isn’t for cutting down vines or chopping away stubborn branches - it is a defence against thieves. Lots of other men - farmers like him - are out in the rain, patrolling the forest. For the past three months, they have left their homes every night and made the long journey into the plantations to protect their crop. But this is not an illegal coca plantation, or anything like it. In fact, these farmers are growing a crop whose name is a byword for something boring. The men need weapons to guard against robbers who roam the countryside looking for one thing - Madagascan vanilla. They show that these vanilla vines belong to Leon Charles. That’s my name. My nickname - people here call me Baba.” Leon is with his wife, Oristin, in their garden, where they grow coffee and vanilla in the village of Ambanizana, at the edge of the Masoala National Park, in the north-east corner of Madagascar. It’s a hard place to get to - there are no roads to speak of. From the island’s capital, Antananarivo, it takes two flights, two hours on a speedboat and another 30 minutes in a canoe to reach Ambanizana. The island of Madagascar is the world's largest producer of vanilla beans The village is full of music. Upbeat dance melodies blare through the sheer, pink curtain covering the doorway of Leon’s home - a rectangular, wooden structure with a peaked roof. Here, the forest meets the sea and the high humidity, shade, and moderate temperatures make it perfect for growing vanilla. Each vine that Leon prunes holds pods - also known as beans - that will eventually retail for more than $150 (£120), once they are dried. To deter theft, all the farmers in the surrounding area are stamping their names, or sometimes serial numbers, on to individual pods while they’re still on the vine. Even when the pods are dried, the markings can be made out. Leon was robbed before last year’s harvest - and it was devastating for his family. “I was working in my [nearby] rice field when they quickly took advantage in order to steal,” he says. “I was so sad, I even cried, because we lost everything. I didn’t have money to send the children to school.  Our household has been experiencing hardship for a whole year.” But it could have been even worse. The robberies are often violent. There have been dozens of murders in Madagascar linked to vanilla. Several communities have tried and failed to get protection from armed police. Some have taken the law into their own hands. Villagers say in a nearby village, a machete-wielding crowd descended on five suspected gangsters - hacking and stabbing them to death. The killings have yet to be solved by the police. Locals say there is no will or capacity in the police forces to investigate the vanilla thefts - or the mob justice that sometimes follows. The chief of Leon’s village fears the same thing could happen there. A youngish-looking man, Chief Oreis is wearing shorts and sandals with a bright purple shirt when he stops by Leon’s house to say hello. His expression grows stern when he talks about the vanilla thefts. “We have to do our best to make sure thieves are not able to steal from us here,” he says. “Because if someone’s livelihood is taken away, they can do anything, even kill.” Thousands of miles away in London, Oddono’s ice cream shop is tucked between a pizza parlour and a cafe on a busy street in South Kensington. There’s a plethora of awards on one wall. The owners boast of the finest natural ingredients in their authentic Italian gelato: Valrhona chocolate from France, pistachios from Sicily, hazelnuts from Piedmont. But last year, one variety of ice cream was missing. “When I told customers that we didn’t have any vanilla ice cream, many of them were shocked,” says Christian Oddono, who manages the shop. “I had to explain that we didn’t want to give them bad quality products but also we were never going to use chemicals. Then, they understood.” The price for last year’s Madagascan vanilla crop was sky high, but Christian found the quality of what he was getting so low that he took vanilla ice cream off his menu. “The pods had too much moisture in them and some even had a mouldy smell - a sign that the curing process wasn’t done properly,” he says. “This year I found another, better supplier in Madagascar. The prices are still high, so we’ve had to raise our prices as well, but our customers haven’t complained. We see a general trend of more customers wanting to eat more authentic food and shying away from chemicals and lab-produced substitutes.” Thousands of miles away in London, Oddono’s ice cream shop is tucked between a pizza parlour and a cafe on a busy street in South Kensington.

But if you’re eating something vanilla-flavoured or smelling something vanilla-scented - it’s probably artificial. Scientists have been making synthetic vanillin - the compound that gives vanilla its aroma - since the 19th Century. It has been extracted from coal, tar, rice bran, wood pulp and even cow dung. Today, the vast majority ofsynthetic vanillincomes from petrochemicals. It can be20 times cheaperthan the real thing. The burgeoning interest in “artisanal” food made in a traditional way explains some of the demand for natural vanilla. But much of the rocketing price can be put down to food rules on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe and the United States, ice cream labelled “vanilla” must contain natural vanillin extract from vanilla pods. If the flavour comes wholly or partly from artificial sources, the packaging must say “vanilla flavour” or “artificial vanilla”. Vanilla from vanilla pods will have a taste and potency unique to the area in which it is grown, much like wine. The vanilla from Madagascar has a distinct rummy taste and sweet aroma, which is why ice-cream makers choose it over vanilla from other countries. And there is more and more pressure on food companies to switch from artificial vanilla to vanilla beans.  Big corporations such as Hershey and Nestle have started buying natural vanilla extract for their products in large quantities, which injects more demand into the limited supply chain and raises prices further.

Much of the selecting and grading is done by women The vanilla orchid is native to Mexico but it is only a minor producer, having been overtaken by Madagascar in the 1960s. Indonesia is the other big producer. French colonists first brought vanilla to Madagascar’s neighbouring island of Réunion in the early 19th Century. It grows as a clinging vine, reaching lengths of up to 300ft (90m). The vines grow well outside Mexico - but no fruit, in the form of vanilla beans, was produced. Horticulturists eventually discovered what was missing. The pollen on a vanilla orchid flower is inaccessible to most insects, including typical honey bees. The small Melipona bee, which lives in only Mexico, was the only one able to reach the vanilla pollen and fertilise the flowers. Still, relying on the bees for pollination is a hit-and-miss affair as the pale white orchids bloom for just one day each year and the flower is fertile for only eight to 12 hours after it blooms. On Réunion, an enslaved boy named Edmond Albius invented a painstaking way of pollinating by hand. A sharp, thin stick is used to lift the fragile membrane between the male and female parts of the flower, which are then pushed into each other for pollination to occur. This has to be done for every single flower on every vine in order to produce the fruit - vanilla pods filled with thousands of the tiny black seeds we eventually see in high-quality vanilla ice cream. Madagascan farmers have to check their plants every morning. If a farmer misses the fertilisation window for a flower, or damages the plant, he loses out on precious pods - it takes about 600 blossoms pollinated by hand to produce just 1kg of cured vanilla beans. After pollination, it takes nine months for the vanilla pods to mature - then, they are harvested. The still-green beans start to ferment quickly, so buyers must be found fast.  Small farmers typically sell green pods to middlemen who gather large amounts to sell on to local exporters. At this point, the pods do not have the characteristic vanilla smell or taste. The laborious  journey - from pollination to curing and drying, and then preparing for export - takes about a year. The green beans are immersed in boiling water to stop the fermentation process The finished product is a brownish-black, heavily wrinkled vanilla bean that is soft, supple and leathery to the touch, with a strong aroma. On a dusty street in the middle of the market town of Maroantsetra, I am trying to do a deal. This year’s harvest won’t come in for several more weeks -  but the dealers here in the “grey market” may have some to sell. One “commissionaire” - a middleman - I spoke to nearer to the villages had only 300g (10oz) of the stuff and told me quite honestly: “This is not good quality.” But the group of men sitting under the shade of a row of small shops have managed to produce some, after a long wait. The goods are delivered on a bright green motorbike. The rider wears gold rings and his necklace catches the light as he pulls me aside to reveal the package. The dealer weighs the vacuum-packed pods “This is 2kg,” the dealer tells me proudly, “3.3 million ariary.” That’s $1,000. I tell him I can’t afford to buy it. He shrugs and smiles but he is not disappointed - there will be other more serious buyers. The heavy package is not drugs. Through the clear plastic pouch, coated in a light film of dust, I can see dark, moist vanilla beans. They are vacuum-sealed - a practice that the government is banning because it plays a part in reducing the quality of the bean that Madagascar is so well known for. Vanilla is often vacuum-packed so it can be stored for months after the harvest The process can be used by speculators to preserve pods that have been harvested too early. They often store them to sell later at higher prices. But immature or improperly cured beans have a lower vanillin content and often a mouldy taste. Many farmers choose to pick their pods early themselves to avoid losing everything to thieves in the last months before the harvest. The government has tried to stop this by setting fixed harvest dates for each village. To hammer the message home, the authorities recently burned 500kg of prematurely picked pods in public. But there are smaller middlemen who are under immense pressure to get their beans early - and at a lower price. They get cash advances from big exporters - but they must deliver. Waiting until harvest time, when demand exceeds supply, can be risky. Arman Ramarokootonirina has been working as a middleman buying up vanilla from farmers in Maroantsetra for more than seven years. Commissionaire Arman Ramarokootonirina There are many unscrupulous new entrants into the industry, he says. It is now flush with cash. “It is the greed of the big bosses that is causing the problem. People get big advances yet they haven’t even planted any vanilla. Then they have to steal it from other people’s gardens to fulfill the orders.” But for the growers who are able to protect their crops, the high vanilla prices mean one good harvest can be life-changing. A kilogram of cured beans is worth $400-$500 - a hefty sum in a country where the average annual per capita income is $1,500. In the village of Ambanizana, you can see the vanilla money at work. Parents are able to send their children to bigger, better schools outside the village. Modern brick houses are springing up where traditional wooden houses once stood. There is a big construction site at the edge of the village. The foreman reveals they are building a disco and restaurant, the first of its kind in Ambanizana. The owner of the project is a “vanillionaire” - he has made his money both as a vanilla grower and as a commissionaire. The farmers may be making more money than before - but their small plots of land produce limited amounts of vanilla. It is the middlemen and the exporters who are raking in the big money. The inaccessibility of the vanilla-growing regions means they are an essential part of the supply chain. Commissionaires travel around the villages, buying up large quantities of green vanilla pods to sell on to big exporting companies who cure and ship them around the world. The grandest building in Maroantsetra is the headquarters of one of these exporters. Painted pristine white with dark green trim, it’s a striking contrast to the wooden houses on either side.Up to four tonnes of vanilla are exported from here every year. Security cameras line the path to the large warehouse at the back of the complex. There are big padlocks on the gates and iron bars criss-cross the windows. Exporter Sylvan Chen's headquarters in Maroantsetra Sylvan Chen runs the place. They pat down the staff at the end of each day to make sure no vanilla is being smuggled out in bags, shoes or underwear. It’s not vanilla season yet, so the women on the lower floor of the warehouse now are sifting cloves - another spice exported from Madagascar, nowhere near as lucrative as vanilla. The upper floor is where the vanilla will be stored while it’s being dried. The space is packed to the rafters with cheap foam mattresses. Sylvan sold 2,000 of them last year to farmers, who prefer them to sleeping on traditional woven mats. They’re often handing back the cash Sylvan has just given them for their vanilla. Many farmers also grow cloves for export Exporter Sylvan Chen Times are good for the industry, now that the price of vanilla is so high, Sylvan acknowledges. But there is a fear that short-term gains will cause long-term damage to the quality and reputation of Madagascan vanilla. “Madagascar’s vanilla is too expensive and people could turn to other countries which are equipped with quality standards. The vanilla sector here may no longer have a future if the quality doesn’t improve”. In a speedboat cruising down the coast at the edge of Masoala National park, I see bare patches of land breaking up the lush green forest like an ugly rash. Park ranger Armand Marozafy and environmental activist Clovis Razafimalala say this is the price this park has paid since vanilla prices began to soar. From the water, they point out more parts of the forest coastline that have been burnt down so that crops  - mainly vanilla - can be planted. Park ranger Armand Marozafy Inside the forest, home to endangered lemurs, it becomes even clearer what is at stake. Densely packed trees and unyielding vines suddenly give way to a clearing. Saplings have sprung up between charred stumps of ancient trees. The trees that were chopped down were more than 100 years old. The clearing is not very big, but as Armand explains, the problem is that there are patches like this all over the place. Trees and forest that are cut down cannot grow back the same way again - it would take hundreds of years. When this sort of damage occurs, a fragile ecosystem is disrupted. Lemurs will no longer have food here. Plants, insects and animals that relied on a delicate balance start to disappear. People in Madagascar are worried about its vanilla losing its reputation - but in the national park a fragile ecosystem is being badly damaged to cater for global demand. It is short-sightedness. As trees start to disappear, the unique conditions that make this a perfect place to grow vanilla will start to disappear as well. The forests provide the right amount of rainfall, humidity and soil to grow Madagascar’s coveted brand of vanilla. Cutting down forest to grow more vanilla will eventually make it harder to grow quality vanilla on the island. The industry will have to find ways to ensure consistent quality in order to prevent buyers from looking elsewhere. Francois Ravelonjara, a vanilla farmer in Maroansetra, wears an air of resignation as he stamps a serial number on to vanilla pods in his small farm. Farmer Francois Ravelonjara The number corresponds to one in his carte de planteur de vanille, a registration document distributed to vanilla growers by the government to prove ownership and curb theft. The markings have not prevented thieves from raiding his plot twice already. It would be better if the prices went down again,” he says. “We didn’t make much - but at least we did not live in fear.” Many long-term growers and traders echo that sentiment. Much like the blooming of the vanilla orchid flower, they know the current boom will not last very long. But the effects of it will. Built with Shorthand"
Corona beer firm pours $4bn into cannabis,"There are nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme Corona beer owner Constellation Brands is set to pour some $4bn (Â£3.15bn) into Canada's top cannabis producer, Canopy Growth, in a deal marking the largest investment in the industry to date. Last year, Constellation injected $200m into Canopy in a deal to produce a non-alcoholic cannabis-based beverage. The alcohol firm wants to capitalise on the growing legalisation of the drug. On news of the deal, Canopy's Toronto-listed stock surged 30%, while on Wall Street, Constellation's fell 6%. The two firms said the investment would allow Canopy to expand its business reach""in the nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme"",external. Canopy,which has the largest legal cannabis production footprint in the world,external, currently produces cannabis-based oils and soft gel caps, among other products. Cannabis debate: What you need to know Medical cannabis products to be legalised Hague's 'legalise cannabis' call rejected With Constellation's latest injection of cash, Canopy plans to expand its suite of products to include edible bars, inhalers and pre-rolled items. It also wants to develop cannabinoid-based medicines that provide a safer alternative to some mainstream treatments for pain, anxiety, sleeplessness and psoriasis. ""This [deal] marks the end of the warm-up in our sector... it's fully go-time,"" said Canopy's chief executive Bruce Linton on an investment call. Constellation, which makes and markets beer, wine and spirits in the US, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Italy, noted that governments around the world had already signalled a significant change in attitudes towards cannabis and cannabis-based products. ""Over the past year, we've come to better understand the cannabis market, the tremendous growth opportunity it presents, and Canopy's market-leading capabilities in this space,""said  Rob Sands, chief executive of Constellation Brands,external. In June, the Canadian government passed a bill which will effectively legalise the recreational cannabis market in the country. The bill is set to be rolled out in October. Constellation's latest investment in Canopy takes its ownership in the firm to 38%. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be closed no earlier than the end of October.

Teenagers braced for A-level results,"A-level students have been awarded the highest proportion of As and A*s since 2012, amid changes toughening the exams in England. Some 26.4% of exams have been awarded these top grades this year - but the proportion gaining A* to C dropped to 78.4% from 79% last year. England's exams regulator has said the results show a steady national picture at a time of significant change. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their results. Overall, 97.6% of A-level entries were awarded A* to E grades. Examiners dismissed the rise in top grades as ""extremely marginal"", while Ofqual has underlined that results have remained steady. In 2012, 26.6% of exams were awarded As and A*s. And in 2017, 26.3% achieved these top grades. A-level results 2018: Experts answer your questions What's new about this year's A-levels? Clearing: ""It's not the end of the world"" Unconditional university offer 'gave me confidence' Welsh students see rise in top grades In England, A-levels have been moving away from coursework and returning to students being graded on final exams. However, a mix of old-style and new exams are being taken in Wales and Northern Ireland. Last year, students in England took new, more challenging exams in 13 subjects, with 11 more following this year. The remaining subjects are being refreshed over the next two years. Regulator Ofqual promised grade boundaries could be lowered, once papers were marked, if the new exams were tougher than expected. This video can not be played BBC Rewind: The highs, lows and... embarrassing mums A-levels have also been separated from AS-levels in England, leading to a significant decline in the numbers sitting the separate exam at the end of the first year. For the second year running, boys have outperformed girls at the top grades. Last year, this happened for the first time in 17 years, amid the move to the new-style exams. This year 26.6% of exam entries for boys were awarded an A or A*, compared with 26.2% of girls. This compares with 26.6% and 26.1% respectively last year. There has been a rise in the number of students taking Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. These subjects accounted for over a third of A-level entries, but are still favoured by boys. In Wales, there have been improvements in students' performance at the top grades, with 26.3% getting A* and A grades. It means Welsh results at the top end are now in line with the overall UK figure, after lagging behind for several years. The regulator Ofqual says that grade boundaries have remained ""relatively stable"". It has compared the first batch of 13 reformed A-levels in England, sat in 2017, with those taken this year. This shows that, for 124 papers, the A grade boundary decreased this year, while it increased for 118 papers and for 95 papers, stayed the same. There was a decrease in the marks needed for a grade E in 91 papers, an increase for 110 papers and in 136 papers, the boundary stayed the same. ""Overall, the grade boundaries for individual papers are relatively stable compared to last summer,"" Ofqual said. ""At both grades A and E, a similar number of grade boundaries have increased as have decreased. ""On average, the grade boundaries at grade A have changed by around a quarter of a raw mark, and the grade boundaries at grade E have changed by less than a quarter of a raw mark."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds congratulated everyone receiving their results. He said: ""It is the culmination of a lot of hard work and dedication - from both those receiving their marks and the teachers who've been supporting them every step of the way. ""They should rightly feel proud of their achievements."" But Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the sheer weight of the changes had placed an intolerable additional strain on staff and students. ""We have no doubt that this has affected the mental health and wellbeing of a proportion of young people and teachers,"" he said. He urged the government to pay heed and ensure any future changes were introduced in a more manageable and considered manner. Students celebrating their results include Caitlyn Palmer, Mohamed Dini Munye Abrar and Daniella Adeluwoye Student Daniella Adeluwoye, from London, said she was ""ecstatic"" after winning a place at the University of Cambridge - despite teachers advising her not to apply for the course after ""average"" GCSE results. Caitlyn Palmer, whose place at the University of York has been confirmed, said her teachers were ""so supportive"" when she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression during her A-levels, adding the stress placed on students is ""completely unfair"". 'I didn't know black people went to Cambridge' Ucas figures show 411,860 students have taken university places so far - down 1% on last year. But a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population have already been accepted. A dip in the number of 18-year-olds, due to a lower birth rate in 2000, means universities are looking to fill their places Even the more selective universities are offering places to students through clearing which is the process by which universities fill their unallocated course places. There has also been a rise in unconditional offers and other ways of attracting students, such as bursaries. Ucas said thatlast year about one in eight people accepted to full-time university courses got there through clearing,external. This year, 30,000 courses are available through the Ucas system. For students who took Btec qualifications, results were released on Wednesday. Btecs, which also count towards Ucas points, are specialist work-related qualifications, designed for young people interested in working in a particular sector or industry. And in Scotland, results for Highers and Advanced Highers were published last week. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes,with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the exact percentage figures relating to the proportion of exam entries by boys and girls awarded an A or A*.

"Why clearing 'is not the end of the world""","Ellie says it's important to stay calm What are the options when A-level grades are not what you were expecting for your next step? Teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland find out on Thursday whether they have got into the university of their choice - but not all will be successful. ""I didn't intend to apply to university through clearing, I just unfortunately didn't get the A-level results I needed to get into my original choices,"" says Ellie Clarke, 21. Ellie says she didn't want her A-levels to hold her back from going to university, so she decided to use clearing and get a place that way. ""I don't think anyone enjoys not getting the grades they wanted, and it's not fun having to ring around universities trying to find a place on a course you like."" Although Ellie found the situation she was in stressful at the time, she says it's definitely not the end of the world - she was offered a place at the University of Derby, has just graduated with a BSc in Human Biology and is now heading off to Warwick University to study medicine. A-level results 2018: Teenagers achieve rise in top grades A-level results 2018: We answer your questions What's new about this year's A-levels? Clearing, which isrun by the admissions service Ucas,external, is the way that universities and colleges fill any places they still have on their degree courses, and allows would-be undergraduates to see which courses still have places remaining. If you're using it this year, Ellie suggests: ""Do some preparation beforehand - I made sure that I had read through the clearing application process so I would be able to get started making phone calls straight away, without having to look up how the whole process works. ""Importantly, I'd tell people that while not getting into any of your choice [of] universities feels like the end of the world at the time, it's going to be OK. ""Stay calm, do your research on the courses that are available, so you don't jump into a course you don't like just for the sake of getting into university."" Amanda Ng, 21, who also secured her degree place at the University of East Anglia (UEA) through clearing, says: ""Don't be scared about entering clearing. Amanda has recently graduated and has got a job in journalism ""The process is designed to help you choose the best university for you. There are still many great universities with places available in clearing."" Amanda narrowly missed out on her first choice of university after receiving four points fewer than she needed, and applied to UEA through clearing, after deciding that she didn't want to go to her second-choice university. ""I was anxious to officially decline the offer I had been given by my second-choice university, but the process of clearing was so easy it gave me confidence. ""I found it simple, fast and efficient and I was informed I'd received a place at UEA only a few days after I'd entered the process.""

Ellie says: ""The Ucas website has a lot of good information about the clearing process, which is really worth reading and getting familiar with - it helped me to understand what I needed to do, and what would happen to make an application. ""There's also a lot of good information online from other people who have been through the process, which made things a little clearer for me."" For more general careers advice you can also call the Exam Results Helpline on 0800 100 900, which is run by theNational Careers Service,external. It is a free service and is open from 08:00 to 22:00, seven days a week. It is staffed by careers advisers and offers advice on sixth form, college, university and other education choices, skills, qualifications, and subject choices, resits and re-marks, gap years, vocational learning routes including diplomas, apprenticeships, careers and employment, confirmation, clearing, adjustment and funding. Ucas operates a system calledadjustment,externalfor those students who get better results than expected and want to try to get a place at a more competitive university. Candidates have a five-day window in which to show their application to universities. If you don't find a suitable place somewhere else through adjustment, you remain accepted at your original choice. University is not for everyone and, by not going to university, there is the added advantage of not accruing student debt. Many people without degrees go on to pursue highly successful and lucrative careers - Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and Kirstie Allsopp to name a few famous ones. Some careers, such as accountancy, can be pursued with qualifications you study for while working. Apprenticeships are another possibility - vacancies are listed on theNational Apprenticeships Service,externalwebsite. John Cope, head of education and skills at the CBI, said: ""University absolutely offers students a great next step but is by no means the only route to a higher-level education. ""There are a range of different options - a Higher National Certificate or Diploma, a foundation degree, or a ""degree apprenticeship"", with an apprenticeship offering the chance to gain both a qualification employers value and start earning a salary straight away."" NICEIC, which provides assessment and certification services for electricians, says the average salary for electricians around the country is Â£47,265. Darren Staniforth, technical development manager at NICEIC, says: ""The perception that you can only have a successful career if you study at university, is a false one. ""Students are increasingly taking an interest in trade industries - with apprenticeships becoming a much more enticing proposition."" If giving university a miss sounds right for you, websites likeNot Going to Uni,externalcan offer suggestions of alternative routes you can take. However, many professions, such as teaching and law, do require a degree and you could find that some doors are closed to you later in life - or are much harder to open - if you do not have one. There is always the option of taking a gap year and reapplying for degree courses or apprenticeships this autumn. A year out can be a chance to develop new skills which can all help when writing a personal statement or CV - volunteer work, travelling abroad or a working for a year are all options to consider. In the longer term, it may be better to wait a year and go somewhere that is right for you, rather than make a hasty decision which you might regret later. Your local further education college should be able to help with information about other routes to degree-level qualifications, such as foundation degrees and diplomas. Whatever you decide, try to stay calm and make decisions when you've had a chance to think things through. Amanda says: ""I carefully talked things through with my family before I made each decision throughout the process. ""Remember to breathe deeply, remain positive, and take a moment before you make those calls - you're certainly not alone."" Ellie adds: ""Don't worry - each university is amazing in their own way, so wherever you end up, you'll enjoy it."" A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades A-level results a surprise?

Hundreds caught speeding by volunteers,"This video can not be played The villagers catching speeding drivers Volunteers are catching more than 100 speeding drivers a month on average in the Gwent Police force area. As part of the UK-wide Community Speed Watch scheme, trained recruits use a speed gun to monitor sections of road. Gwent Police handed out 1,526 warnings to motorists caught by local recruits between February 2017 and May 2018. New volunteer Abbie Rands, 20, said the work is a ""personal thing"" for her, with two sisters regularly out playing in the village where she lives. Tourist 'stuck in Dubai' over Â£36k speeding fine 500 drivers caught speeding every day in Wales 120mph driver was 'desperate for the loo' Ms Rands is part of the Speed Watch group in Little Mill, Monmouthshire - one of a growing number across the Gwent area. Local pastor Colin Berg helped set up the group after a speeding car overturned and smashed down the village church wall. The Little Mill group is one of a growing number of Speed Watch schemes in the Gwent area ""We felt something had to happen,"" he said. ""We've caught someone doing 55mph in this 30mph area."" Abbie Rands, 20, is one of the group's newest recruits, having grown up in the village. ""I try to do it about once a week when I can,"" she said. ""I've got two younger sisters and seeing them out playing with their friends, it's a personal thing. I want to give people a safer village to live in, basically."" Abbie Rands, 20, grew up in Little Mill and now volunteers with the local Speed Watch group According to Mr Berg, local authority data suggests 76% of drivers exceeded the speed limit through the village in 2017. In 2018, that estimate has dropped to 65%. Young and old drivers targeted in bid to cut crashes 'Cow in car' driver found by police ""We all know we're living in times of austerity, the police have to make priorities and we understand that,"" he said. ""We can do something about this, but we can't do something about catching burglars!"" He added that the group is about educating, not penalising - and it is ""a good day"" if they do not catch anyone.
