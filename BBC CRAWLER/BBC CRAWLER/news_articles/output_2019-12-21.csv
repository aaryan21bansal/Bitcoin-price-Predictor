'Martin Peters - a trailblazer',"This video can not be played 1966 World Cup Final: Martin Peters volleys England in front Martin Peters, who has died aged 76, will forever be remembered as the England World Cup winner described as ""10 years ahead of his time"" by his manager Sir Alf Ramsey. As immaculate off the pitch as he was on it, Peters was the thinking man's midfielder and a trailblazer for the modern goalscoring midfield players who populate the Premier League today. 'Icon, hero, gentleman' - tributes paid to Martin Peters He scored England's second goal in the 4-2 win over West Germany in the World Cup final - but this is just one part of a career that brought club successes in domestic and European football to set aside his day in the glorious sunshine at Wembley on 30 July 1966. Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson feature in a statue near West Ham's former Upton Park stadium Plaistow-born Peters, whose father was a lighterman on the River Thames, was a product of the West Ham United academy, a hothouse of forward thinking led by players such as Malcolm Allison and put into practice by managers Ted Fenton and most notably Ron Greenwood. Tall, lean and elegant, Peters was the perfect pupil for Greenwood's desire to bring intelligence and tactical awareness to the game, developing alongside those other England World Cup heroes captain Bobby Moore and hat-trick hero Sir Geoff Hurst -  and Hammers fans still boast about how West Ham won the World Cup. He had the natural gifts and awareness that allowed him to act like a sponge for Greenwood's progressive techniques, easily absorbing his manager's instructions and carrying them out with authority. Peters, like another West Ham legend of later years Sir Trevor Brooking, exerted his influence through speed of thought and natural ability as opposed to physical presence. He became known as 'The Ghost' for his ability to arrive undetected among heavy traffic in the penalty area to score. He made his debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4-1 win against Cardiff City and his first goal came in a 6-1 win at Manchester City the following September. It was the start of a career that would bring him 100 goals in 364 games for West Ham as he settled into a pattern of performance and goalscoring that would define his style. Greenwood's team was regarded as talented but fragile alongside the fierce competition offered by the likes of Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool, Leeds United and the north London giants Arsenal and Tottenham, but they still enjoyed moments of glory. Amid that success there was disappointment for Peters, who was not included in the West Ham side that won the FA Cup final against Preston North End in 1964, victory being secured by Ronnie Boyce's last-minute winner. There was to be consolation, of sorts, for Peters a year later when he was a key component of the team that won the European Cup Winners' Cup against 1860 Munich at Wembley, courtesy of two goals from Alan Sealey. Peters continued to be one of the most significant members of a West Ham team that was pleasing on the eye, operating with characteristic stealth and intelligence, but short on success - his future glories were to come elsewhere. Martin Peters scored England's second goal in the 1966 World Cup final In the modern parlance, Peters was a ""bolter"" in Sir Alf Ramsey's plans for the 1966 World Cup - the player who came up on the rails to make his case for inclusion close to the tournament. It proved to be an inspired choice by Ramsey as Peters helped him fulfil his much-derided prophecy that England would indeed lift the Jules Rimet Trophy on home soil. Peters only made his England debut on 4 May 1966 in a 2-0 win over Yugoslavia at Wembley, scoring the first of his 20 goals for his country on his second appearance against Finland in Helsinki on 26 June. He did not actually figure in England's line-up at the start of the 1966 World Cup, missing the opening group game against Uruguay at Wembley. Peters started the second match against Mexico and was then a permanent fixture under Ramsey. Peters helped Ramsey implement a system known as the ""wingless wonders"" after Liverpool's Ian Callaghan, Southampton's Terry Paine and Manchester United's John Connelly all played in the group phase but were left out of the knockout games as England's system reaped the ultimate reward. He once said: ""I wasn't a winger. Alan Ball and I were midfield players that broke wide. We had to get back and defend. We worked hard to defend when we played against a midfield player opposite us and then would break to support attacks. ""I wasn't quick but I could run and run and run, so I would run into the box, see a space, run into there. If the ball didn't come in you'd get out again, run in and then would come in and bang - goal."" It was Peters' cross from the left flank that enabled Hurst to head home England's winner in the tempestuous quarter-final against Argentina at Wembley, a game remembered for the sending-off and lengthy departure of the visitors' captain Antonio Rattin and Ramsey tearing George Cohen's shirt away from an opponent as they tried to exchange them at the final whistle. At the age of 22, Peters was to take his place in England's sporting hall of fame as he scored the sort of goal that became his trademark in the final against West Germany, pouncing in the penalty box to put England 2-1 ahead. Hurst recalled: ""When you look at the film of Martin after his goal in the final you can see him flicking his fingers out. He said the exhilaration was like an electric current running through his hands. ""He was a fantastic player, a natural footballer who was totally and utterly devoted to the game."" It was the high watermark of his England career and future World Cups would provide bitter disappointment for Peters and Ramsey, the manager whose aloof public profile was at odds with the complete devotion he inspired in his players. Peters, now at Spurs, was still central to Ramsey's plans when an England team many still argue was better than the 1966 World Cup winners in terms of pure talent, headed to Mexico four years later. The great names remained while Nobby Stiles had been replaced in midfield by Spurs captain Alan Mullery, Everton pair Brian Labone and Keith Newton replaced Jack Charlton and Cohen, while Manchester City's Francis Lee came in for Liverpool's Roger Hunt. Martin Peters (r) is one of only two Englishmen to ever score in a World Cup final And when Peters put England 2-0 up in the now infamous quarter-final against West Germany in Leon with one of those familiar far-post arrivals on the end of Newton's right-wing cross, Ramsey looked on course for more success. Instead, with the outstanding Chelsea goalkeeper Peter Bonetti having a rare off day as a late replacement after Gordon Banks was taken ill and Ramsey's substitution of Bobby Charlton with Colin Bell backfiring, West Germany fought back to win 3-2. It was the end of that golden England era. Peters was Ramsey's captain, with Moore replaced by Norman Hunter, on one of the dark nights of England's football history - 17 October 1973 and the final World Cup qualifier against Poland at Wembley that they needed to win to qualify for the 1974 finals in West Germany. It was a night that belonged to Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski, labelled ""a clown"" by Brian Clough, as he performed heroics and his goal led a charmed life as England could only draw 1-1. It was the end of Ramsey, and Peters followed not long after. He won his final cap on 18 May 1974 in the 2-0 defeat by Scotland at Hampden Park, Joe Mercer having taken over as caretaker manager from Ramsey. Peters may have had an inauspicious end to a magnificent England career but his record of 67 caps, 20 goals and a World Cup win secures his place in history. Peters lifts the League Cup for Tottenham in 1973 Peters cut his ties with West Ham in March 1970, becoming Britain's first Â£200,000 player when he signed for Spurs, although a portion of the fee was taken up with Jimmy Greaves making the reverse journey to Upton Park. He was at his peak at 26, figuring in a side with a more ruthless edge under manager Bill Nicholson and alongside players of the calibre of Pat Jennings, Mike England, Mullery, Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman and Alan Gilzean. Peters was able to add his elegant flourishes and natural eye for a goal to these talents and he went on to further success at White Hart Lane. He scored on his debut in a 2-1 loss against Coventry City and finally won domestic honours when Spurs beat Aston Villa 2-0 in the 1971 League Cup final at Wembley. Peters was captain when Spurs repeated the feat two years later as Norwich City were beaten in the final. Peters won the Uefa Cup with Spurs in 1972 when Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten in an all-English final, but tasted defeat in the final two years later when they lost to Feyenoord in a tie that was overshadowed by crowd violence. He left Spurs for Norwich City in a Â£50,000 deal in March 1975, having scored 76 goals in 260 appearances for the club. Even in his latter years, Peters was still able to show the old mastery and enjoyed an Indian summer at Carrow Road, winning the club's player of the year award in 1976 and 1977. In 2002 he was made an inaugural member of Norwich City's Hall Of Fame. In 1978, while still at Norwich, Peters was made an MBE for services to football. He is still regarded as one of the finest players to represent the Canaries, scoring 44 goals in 206 league appearances before joining Sheffield United as player-coach in July 1980. Peters was Harry Haslam's designated successor as Sheffield United manager but only had a brief and unhappy spell in charge for 16 games between January and May in the 1980-81 season when the Blades were relegated to the old Fourth Division. It was his final involvement as a player or manager and he later went on to work in the insurance industry. Peters made a career total of 880 appearances, scoring 220 goals and was inducted into English football's Hall Of Fame in 2006, confirming his status as one of the towering figures of the post-war football generation.

Visiting the Tapa military base near Tallinn, Mr Johnson wished them a merry Christmas as he dished up the meals. The 850 British soldiers based there represent the UK's largest operational deployment in Europe. The PM also stressed the UK's commitment to Nato and its defence of Estonia's eastern border with Russia. The UK is playing a leading role in the alliance's Baltic mission.

"'Toxic' Christmas dolls prompt national alertChemicals in Sweet Fashion Doll and Girl Beautiful Doll may affect future fertility, experts warn.","The dolls mimic popular brands, but do not carry quality marks and there is poor English on the packaging Toxic chemicals have been found in cheap dolls putting children exposed to them at risk of long-term fertility problems, officials warn. The Sweet Fashion Doll and Girl Beautiful Doll - costing between Â£1 and Â£3 - have been supplied across the UK. The Nottingham wholesaler is being investigated by city officials, who said it could not yet be named or the shops it supplied for Christmas. The dolls contain high levels of phthalates, say trading standards. The potentially harmful chemicals are used to toughen plastic in the Chinese-made dolls, said the council team. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned that very young children and babies could chew the toys and ""consume the chemicals"" Jane Bailey, the team's manager, said: ""We understand the financial pressures people are under at the moment, but I'd urge parents to resist the temptation to buy cheap toys like these. ""They will carry none of the required quality marks and will likely have been subjected to no product testing at all."" The council could not tell the BBC how many had been sold, or where in the UK they were on sale. Although such investigations are led by local authorities, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, a national body, said there was a rise of ""substandard toys"" being brought to the UK around Christmas and there had been ""several seizures"". It warned customers to ""remain vigilant"". Robert Chantry-Price, a lead officer for product safety, said: ""It is frightening to think that large quantities of phthalates are still being used in children's toys. ""Phthalates are carcinogenic, mutagenic and can cause reproductive problems but, despite legislation to the contrary, significant amounts of these substances can be found in a wide range of toys and child-care products. ""If these toys fall into the hands of very young children or babies, it's more likely they will chew on the plastic and consume the chemicals.""

US sanctions on Russia gas pipeline spur criticism,"This video can not be played Gas wars: The problem with Nord Stream 2 Germany and Russia have reacted angrily to sanctions approved by US President Donald Trump on a gas pipeline between the two countries. The sanctions target firms building Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that will allow Russia to increase gas exports to Germany. The US considers it a security risk. But Germany accused Washington of interfering in its internal affairs, while Russia and EU officials also criticised the sanctions. Congress voted through the measures as part of a defence bill last week and the legislation, which described the pipeline as a ""tool of coercion"", was signed off by Mr Trump on Friday. The almost $11bn (Â£8.4bn) Nord Stream 2 project has infuriated the US, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers opposing it. The Trump administration fears the pipeline will tighten Russia's grip over Europe's energy supply and reduce its own share of the lucrative European market for American liquefied natural gas. Skateboarding protesters occupy gas pipeline in Germany EU agrees tighter rules for Russian pipeline President Trump has said the 1,225km (760-mile) pipeline, owned by Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, could turn Germany into a ""hostage of Russia"". Speaking on German TV, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the sanctions were an infringement of sovereignty. ""It is up to the companies involved in the construction of the pipeline to take the next decisions,"" he said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea has divided Europe and infuriated the US German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has said the sanctions amount to ""interference in autonomous decisions taken in Europe"". The US sanctions have also angered Russia and the European Union, which says it should be able to decide its own energy policies. ""As a matter of principle, the EU opposes the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business,"" a spokesman for the trading bloc told AFP news agency on Saturday. Russia's foreign ministry also strongly opposed the move, with ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing Washington of promoting an ""ideology"" that hinders global competition. The consortium behind Nord Stream 2 confirmed that it would build the pipeline as soon as possible, despite the sanctions. ""Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We, together with the companies supporting the project, will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible,"" it said. However, Allseas, a Swiss-Dutch company involved in the project, said it had suspended its pipe-laying activities in anticipation of the sanctions. For years EU member states have been concerned about the bloc's reliance on Russian gas. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EU's gas supplies - just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in its single market. The new pipeline will increase the amount of gas going under the Baltic to 55 billion cubic metres per year. Disagreements among EU nations were so strong that, earlier this year,they even threatened to derail the project entirely. The bloc eventually agreed to strengthen regulations against Nord Stream 2, rather than stop it completely, and to bring it under European control. Businesses in Germany, meanwhile, have invested heavily in the project. Chancellor Merkel has tried to assure Central and Eastern European states that the pipeline would not make Germany reliant on Russia for energy. There is concern in other quarters, too. In May, climate activists opposing the use of fossil fuels occupied part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Germany. The demonstrators, who said the project would be more detrimental to the environment than the authorities had claimed, began skateboarding inside the pipes. Police said at least five people had occupied the pipes near Wrangelsburg in northern Germany.

Dozens of pesto lines recalled over peanut fears,"Dozens of pesto products from Italian sauce maker Sacla' are being recalled over fears they may contain peanuts without mentioning them on the label. The Food Standards Agency has issued an allergy alert, warning that 25 pesto products may be affected. The list of products also include own-brand jars of pesto from supermarkets Waitrose and Aldi. The FSA said the products are a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to peanuts. Some customers who had bought any of the pesto jars through supermarkets have been emailed with the warning. One woman was emailed by Morrisons to say: ""Your shopping history shows that you have been sent one or more of these items. Anyone with an allergy or intolerance to peanuts should not consume this product."" In a statement, Sacla' UK's managing director Clare Blampied said: ""The health, safety and welfare of our customers is our number one priority.  We took immediate action to recall every batch of every Sacla' pesto recipe when we were made aware that some cashew nuts, which had been delivered by an external supplier, might contain traces of peanuts. ""Cashew nuts are an integral part of the pesto recipe and, therefore, we contacted all retailers to withdraw our pesto products straightaway from the shelves. ""Anyone who suffers from a peanut allergy should not consume any of these products, and return them to the store where they made the purchase, or contact Sacla' directly. ""We have launched an in-depth investigation into this unusual incident and we are working very closely with the Food Standards Agency.

'Toxic' Christmas dolls prompt national alert,"The dolls mimic popular brands, but do not carry quality marks and there is poor English on the packaging Toxic chemicals have been found in cheap dolls putting children exposed to them at risk of long-term fertility problems, officials warn. The Sweet Fashion Doll and Girl Beautiful Doll - costing between Â£1 and Â£3 - have been supplied across the UK. The Nottingham wholesaler is being investigated by city officials, who said it could not yet be named or the shops it supplied for Christmas. The dolls contain high levels of phthalates, say trading standards. The potentially harmful chemicals are used to toughen plastic in the Chinese-made dolls, said the council team. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned that very young children and babies could chew the toys and ""consume the chemicals"" Jane Bailey, the team's manager, said: ""We understand the financial pressures people are under at the moment, but I'd urge parents to resist the temptation to buy cheap toys like these. ""They will carry none of the required quality marks and will likely have been subjected to no product testing at all."" The council could not tell the BBC how many had been sold, or where in the UK they were on sale. Although such investigations are led by local authorities, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, a national body, said there was a rise of ""substandard toys"" being brought to the UK around Christmas and there had been ""several seizures"". It warned customers to ""remain vigilant"". Robert Chantry-Price, a lead officer for product safety, said: ""It is frightening to think that large quantities of phthalates are still being used in children's toys. ""Phthalates are carcinogenic, mutagenic and can cause reproductive problems but, despite legislation to the contrary, significant amounts of these substances can be found in a wide range of toys and child-care products. ""If these toys fall into the hands of very young children or babies, it's more likely they will chew on the plastic and consume the chemicals.""

PM dismisses concerns over defence firm saleCritics say there are still national security questions over the sale of Cobham to a US equity firm.UK,"Boris Johnson has defended the controversial Â£4bn takeover of UK defence and aerospace company Cobham by a US private equity firm. The government approved the sale of Cobham to Advent International on Friday, afterthe deal was delayed because of national security concerns. Former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West said Cobham holds defence technologies which are ""critically important"". But the PM said ""a lot of checks"" had been gone through to satisfy concerns. Speaking on a trip to see British troops in Estonia, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy. ""A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others."" Advent International made its initial offer in July and it was approved by shareholders in August. The government ordered a review from the competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a week after Admiral Lord Westexpressed concerns, in an interview with the Daily Mail,,external The CMA's report,published at the end of October,external, said the MoD had outlined two main areas of security concern over the sale: The risk of ""unauthorised persons"" obtaining information about the MoD's capabilities and activity The threat to existing MoD programmes (due to funding cuts or moving capabilities ""off-shore"") In a statement on Friday,external, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was satisfied the risks that had been identified had been mitigated ""to an acceptable level"" - and allowed the deal to go ahead. But Admiral Lord West said that while he was ""delighted"" that was the case, ""it does mean that there are national security risks that are being mitigated"". He stressed the importance of maintaining defence capabilities in what he called a ""chaotic and rapidly changing world where old alliances are no longer certain"", adding ""no other advanced industrial nation and certainly no permanent member of the UN Security Council is so cavalier about giving up such capabilities"". Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Lib Dems, described the move as ""deeply concerning"". He added that ""we have yet to see evidence"" that the previous concerns over national security had been mitigated. The decision to approve the takeover was described as ""deeply disappointing'  by Lady Nadine Cobham - part of the family which set up the UK firm. She criticised the timing of the announcement, saying it was ""cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas"", adding: ""In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away."" Shonnel Malani, partner at Advent, said the firm took the takeover ""seriously"". ""We are confident the transaction and undertakings being given on national security, jobs and future investment, provide important long-term assurances for both Cobham's employees and customers, particularly in the UK and also globally,"" Mr Malani added. Cobham, which employs 10,000 people, has extensive contracts with the British military and is seen as a world leader in air-to-air refuelling technology. The firm, based in Wimborne, Dorset, also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles. Its expertise played a significant role in the Falklands War, allowing the Royal Air Force to attack the remote Port Stanley airfield. Mrs Leadsom said the decision had been ""meticulously thought over"" and that she had taken advice from the defence secretary and the deputy national security adviser. She added that sensitive government information would continue to be protected under the new owner and existing contracts would be honoured. The company is also obliged to give the government prior notice of any plans to sell the whole, or elements of, Cobham's business. Just before 10pm on a Friday is an odd time for this kind of thing to be announced. One defence analyst remarked that it was as if the government rather wanted no-one to notice what had happened. The curious timing may actually draw more attention than if it had been done at a more normal hour - few doubted the government would block the deal, and shareholders in Cobham have already voted overwhelmingly in favour. It says something of the sensitive nature of Cobham's business that much of the published version of the competition regulator's report on the takeover was simply blacked out. In one unedited passage of the report, the Ministry of Defence said if the deal went ahead there was ""a risk that the institutional framework and safeguards required by the government's security framework may be undermined"". Aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham became a household name in the 1930s Cobham plc is a group of defence and technology businesses which started out as a family firm founded by Sir Alan Cobham. Sir Alan became a flying instructor in 1918 after volunteering to join the Royal Air Force during World War One. He received a knighthood from King George V in 1926 for his pioneering work in aviation. Sir Alan became a household name after devising Cobham's Flying Circus in the early 1930s. The aeronautical acrobatics show toured England and South Africa. He then went on to focus on air-to-air refuelling and formed Flight Refuelling Limited in 1934, which developed into Cobham plc as it is known today.

England World Cup winner Martin Peters dies,"This video can not be played World Cup final 1966: Martin Peters puts England 2-1 up against West Germany World Cup winner and West Ham legend Martin Peters has died aged 76, his family have announced. Peters, who joined West Ham aged 15, spent 11 years with the club until he became Britain's first Â£200,000 player in a move to Tottenham in 1970. He scored for England in their 1966 World Cup final win over West Germany. West Ham said ""the 1966 World Cup winner passed away peacefully"" on Saturday after ""a long and courageous battle with illness"". 'A trailblazer for modern midfielders' - Martin Peters obituary ""He is the fifth member of English football's greatest-ever team now sadly lost - along with Alan Ball, Ray Wilson, Gordon Banks and his fellow West Ham Academy hero and great friend, Bobby Moore,"" the club added. His former England team-mate Sir Geoff Hurst said it was a ""very sad day for football and for me personally"". ""Martin Peters was one of the all-time greats and a close friend and colleague of mine for in excess of 50 years,"" Hurst continued. ""A fellow World Cup final goalscorer and my West Ham partner for years along with Bobby Moore. RIP old friend."" Sir Bobby Charlton, who also played alongside Peters in 1966 said: ""We shared one of the greatest days of our lives at Wembley and the fact Martin is one of only two Englishman to have scored in a World Cup final gives him a special place in England's history of the game. ""He was a fantastic footballer. As a team-mate he was someone I could trust completely to do his job and I am proud to have shared that great day with him."" Peters won the European Cup Winners' Cup with West Ham in 1965 as well as the Uefa Cup and two League Cups with Spurs.

Asked about his goal, Peters once said: ""The emotion was like being struck by lightning, it was unbelievable."" Ramsey himself said Peters was ""10 years ahead of his time"". West Ham said Peters, Hurst and Moore were able to ""ensure immortality for Ramsey's team"". The club's joint owners David Sullivan and David Gold, said: ""In many ways, though, Martin's greatest legacy is not the World Cup medal itself, but the example that he provides to every young player who walks through the door of our Academy. ""The word 'legend' is used all too freely nowadays. But Martin Peters is a true legend. A legend of West Ham United. A legend of world football. And his contribution to our club and our game will never, ever be forgotten."" Peters won 67 caps for England and made over 700 appearances for clubs throughout his career.

Plans for new debt advice service for Scotland,"Current debt advice systems have suffered with poor morale and staffing problems Plans for a new debt advice service for Scotland have been unveiled by ministers amid growing concern about problem debts. More than 600,000 Scots - 14.2% of the population - are struggling to pay debts and cover their bills,according to the Money Advice Service,external. And Citizens Advice Scotland says it issued more than 100,000 pieces of advice about the issue last year alone. Powers to fund the new service were devolved to Holyrood in January. Experts say more people are falling into debt as the cost of living rises, while incomes remain static. Problem debts hit up to 700,000 Scots Personal insolvencies in Scotland up by 5% UK household debts see big increase Of those who have problem debts in Scotland, it is estimated thatonly about 20% will seek advice,externalfrom a free debt advice provider. But in a new report the Scottish government says it wants to set up a service which is focused on the users. The Tackling Problem Debt Advice report claims growing numbers of people seeking advice may have contributed to low staff morale and high turnover at current advice services. Ministers say they also want to ensure the new service is sustainable in the long-term by providing adequate funding and ensuring the necessary staffing levels. ""Problem debt can increase stress and strain on families and friendships and it often affects those who are already struggling,"" said Business Minister Jamie Hepburn. ""Sadly, these issues can become a greater strain at Christmas. ""Early intervention can help mitigate the damaging effects of problem debt but people often delay getting help, or advice providers struggle to meet demand. ""This plan sets out our ambition to create a free debt advice system that responds to the needs of those who seek it, offers more joined up services and has adequate funding to survive and provide high quality services."" It is hoped longer-term planning could make services more efficient Their plan was drawn up with help from the Tackling Problem Debt Group (TPDG), made up of current advice services and local authorities. It sets out nine actions to ensure the debt services work best for Scottish users. These include: Driving technological innovation Workforce planning Multi-year funding pledges to allow planning for the future The government has also pledged to hold roundtable meetings with providers to streamline services, as well as launching a Scotland-only marketing campaign, to raise public awareness of the services on offer. The report has been welcomed by Citizens Advice Scotland, which already offers free debt advice in Scotland. Chief executive Derek Mitchell said CAS advisers were seeing evidence of problem debts in communities across the country every day. ""The Citizens Advice network in Scotland is one of the biggest providers of free debt advice in the country, and last year we issued over 100,000 pieces of advice relating to debt,"" he added. ""Debt is second only to social security in terms of the top issues our advisers see.""

The Scottish schools tackling waste and poverty,"When teacher Carrie Smith realised some of her pupils were going hungry, she started sending them home with leftover school meals. The innovative scheme has now been running at Cumnock Academy in Ayrshire for two years and demand remains high. In fact, the initiative has been so successful, it has been rolled out to 12 other schools in East Ayrshire. It is one of a series of simple, effective projects drawn up by schools aimed at tackling poverty and waste. They have first-hand experience of the problems encountered by thealmost one in four children living in poverty in Scotland,external. And according to Zero Waste Scotland, 566,000 tonnes of food are thrown out every year - most of it still edible. Here are some of the initiatives operating at schools across Scotland in a bid to address these twin problems. Carrie Smith (left) founded the scheme at Cumnock Academy Every lunchtime at Cumnock Academy, surplus food is portioned, packaged up and blast-chilled so pupils can take it home the next afternoon. Fresh sandwiches, salad and fruit are also available for young people to pick up that day - all free for every student. It was the brainchild of Ms Smith, the principal teacher for guidance, who became aware that some pupils did not always get three meals a day. And it has proved to be a worthwhile scheme - at Cumnock, all of the food is taken by pupils every day, which ""demonstrates the need for it"", Ms Smith said. In November alone, 1,500 portions of food were taken by pupils at the 13 East Ayrshire schools which have adopted the scheme. The scheme aims reduce hunger amongst its pupils and make lunchtime more sustainable Ms Smith was keen to ensure the service remained ""low key"", to ensure pupils were comfortable picking up the meals. It is not means-tested and there is no requirement for extra staff as they do not keep a record of which pupils are using it. That means the schools can run the project at no extra financial cost to local authority. St Bridget's Primary School in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, has been running an initiative to celebrate clean plates and minimise food waste for three years. It started at lunchtime when pupils who ate their meal and left an empty plate were photographed and praised on the schoolTwitter page,externaland in assemblies. The idea has blossomed into part of daily school life at St Bridget's and every child who finishes their hot meal or packed lunch is awarded the title Waste Warrior. Allow Twitter content?

Head teacher Denis Hopkins said it was good for the environment but also meant pupils were being well fed during the day. One Waste Warrior has had their picture taken each lunchtime with a clear plate since starting school in August this year. Parents are also encouraged to tweet pictures of their children from home, restaurants or parties to show off their empty plates. This is to teach children that making important choices about food waste is important wherever they are. Some have tweeted pictures of their kids from all over the world with clean plates in Spain, Greece and even Florida. ""The kids are obsessive about it and the number of families engaged is magic,"" said Mr Hopkins. About one million Christmas jumpers will be purchased this festive season, according to charity Hubbub - despite the fact Scots already own five million. But at one primary school in the Scottish Borders, staff, parents and children are trying to minimise clothing waste this festive season. Christmas jumpers, party dresses and outfits which children have outgrown are being handed in to staff at Jedburgh Primary School. They are then available to collect to parents looking to keep costs down at Christmas. Head teacher Morgan McCreadie said it can be difficult for families to buy new items every year - especially when children grow so quickly. It also encourages families to be more sustainable and reuse items instead of just buying new every December. Stemming the flow of single-use period waste Prom dresses for girls struggling to pay The party clothes donated to the school ""have huge amounts of life left in them"", Ms McCreadie explained. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ""It's wonderful to see schools across Scotland retain the value of the materials to benefit others. ""All too often we consider items, such as surplus food or unwanted clothes, as waste when actually they can be passed on or reused for someone else to enjoy. ""Keeping resources in circulation benefits the planet because it reduces the demand to produce new materials, which can be a significant source of carbon emissions, and enables us to make more of what we already have.""

Security upgrade plan for spy base,"Plans submitted to Harrogate Borough Council would see major changes to the entrance Security improvements are needed at a major communications and intelligence base in North Yorkshire. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has applied for an extensive overhaul of the entrance to RAF Menwith Hill, near Harrogate. Planning application documents say it does not meet the security standards required by the US and UK armed forces. Security regulation for US and UK military operations have ""tightened considerably,"" the MoD says. An environmental screening statement submitted as part of the planning application to Harrogate Borough Council says: ""Due to the classified nature of the operations at the base, security is a prominent concern. ""In response to the heightened risk of terrorist activity in the wake of 9/11, security regulations for both UK and US military operations have been tightened considerably."" More news from Yorkshire The overhauled main entrance would include a new visitor centre, registration office and gatehouse, as well as new security barriers, roads and car parks, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesays. The listening base plays a role in US and UK intelligence gathering RAF Menwith Hill was established in 1954 to act as a ""communication intercept and intelligence support service"" for both the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the documents submitted to the council. The base's operations and location have frequently attracted controversy, with local and national objectors protesting about the nature of work undertaken at the site, as well as the presenceÂ of international military personnel.

PM defends controversial defence firm sale,"Boris Johnson has defended the controversial Â£4bn takeover of UK defence and aerospace company Cobham by a US private equity firm. The government approved the sale of Cobham to Advent International on Friday, afterthe deal was delayed because of national security concerns. Former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West said Cobham holds defence technologies which are ""critically important"". But the PM said ""a lot of checks"" had been gone through to satisfy concerns. Speaking on a trip to see British troops in Estonia, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy. ""A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others."" Advent International made its initial offer in July and it was approved by shareholders in August. The government ordered a review from the competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a week after Admiral Lord Westexpressed concerns, in an interview with the Daily Mail,,external The CMA's report,published at the end of October,external, said the MoD had outlined two main areas of security concern over the sale: The risk of ""unauthorised persons"" obtaining information about the MoD's capabilities and activity The threat to existing MoD programmes (due to funding cuts or moving capabilities ""off-shore"") In a statement on Friday,external, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was satisfied the risks that had been identified had been mitigated ""to an acceptable level"" - and allowed the deal to go ahead. But Admiral Lord West said that while he was ""delighted"" that was the case, ""it does mean that there are national security risks that are being mitigated"". He stressed the importance of maintaining defence capabilities in what he called a ""chaotic and rapidly changing world where old alliances are no longer certain"", adding ""no other advanced industrial nation and certainly no permanent member of the UN Security Council is so cavalier about giving up such capabilities"". Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Lib Dems, described the move as ""deeply concerning"". He added that ""we have yet to see evidence"" that the previous concerns over national security had been mitigated. The decision to approve the takeover was described as ""deeply disappointing'  by Lady Nadine Cobham - part of the family which set up the UK firm. She criticised the timing of the announcement, saying it was ""cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas"", adding: ""In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away."" Shonnel Malani, partner at Advent, said the firm took the takeover ""seriously"". ""We are confident the transaction and undertakings being given on national security, jobs and future investment, provide important long-term assurances for both Cobham's employees and customers, particularly in the UK and also globally,"" Mr Malani added. Cobham, which employs 10,000 people, has extensive contracts with the British military and is seen as a world leader in air-to-air refuelling technology. The firm, based in Wimborne, Dorset, also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles. Its expertise played a significant role in the Falklands War, allowing the Royal Air Force to attack the remote Port Stanley airfield. Mrs Leadsom said the decision had been ""meticulously thought over"" and that she had taken advice from the defence secretary and the deputy national security adviser. She added that sensitive government information would continue to be protected under the new owner and existing contracts would be honoured. The company is also obliged to give the government prior notice of any plans to sell the whole, or elements of, Cobham's business. Just before 10pm on a Friday is an odd time for this kind of thing to be announced. One defence analyst remarked that it was as if the government rather wanted no-one to notice what had happened. The curious timing may actually draw more attention than if it had been done at a more normal hour - few doubted the government would block the deal, and shareholders in Cobham have already voted overwhelmingly in favour. It says something of the sensitive nature of Cobham's business that much of the published version of the competition regulator's report on the takeover was simply blacked out. In one unedited passage of the report, the Ministry of Defence said if the deal went ahead there was ""a risk that the institutional framework and safeguards required by the government's security framework may be undermined"". Aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham became a household name in the 1930s Cobham plc is a group of defence and technology businesses which started out as a family firm founded by Sir Alan Cobham. Sir Alan became a flying instructor in 1918 after volunteering to join the Royal Air Force during World War One. He received a knighthood from King George V in 1926 for his pioneering work in aviation. Sir Alan became a household name after devising Cobham's Flying Circus in the early 1930s. The aeronautical acrobatics show toured England and South Africa. He then went on to focus on air-to-air refuelling and formed Flight Refuelling Limited in 1934, which developed into Cobham plc as it is known today. Aside from aviation, Cobham's innovations include lightweight tanks, radar technology for maritime defence and spacecraft technology.

Its expertise played a significant role in the Falklands War, allowing the Royal Air Force to attack the remote Port Stanley airfield. Defence experts said its role in air-to-air refuelling was essential for modern warfare and could raise national security issues if the company was sold. Shareholders approved Advent's offer in August, but a month later the government intervened in the takeover, citing national security concerns. In a statement on Friday,external, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was satisfied the risks that had been identified had been mitigated ""to an acceptable level"" - and allowed the deal to go ahead. Mrs Leadsom said the decision had been ""meticulously thought over"" and came after she took advice from the defence secretary and the deputy national security adviser. The business secretary added sensitive government information would continued to be protected under the new owner and existing contracts would be honoured. The company is also obliged to give the government prior notice of any plans to sell the whole, or elements of, Cobham's business. Lady Nadine Cobham - part of the family which set up the UK firm - called the decision ""deeply disappointing"" and criticised the timing of the decision. She said it was ""cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas"", adding: ""In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away. ""In Cobham we stand to lose yet another great British defence manufacturer to foreign ownership."" Just before 10pm on a Friday is an odd time for this kind of thing to be announced. One defence analyst remarked that it was as if the government rather wanted no-one to notice what had happened. The curious timing may actually draw more attention than if it had been done at a more normal hour - few doubted the government would block the deal, and shareholders in Cobham have already voted overwhelmingly in favour. It says something of the sensitive nature of Cobham's business that much of the published version of the competition regulator's report on the takeover was simply blacked out. In one unedited passage of the report, the Ministry of Defence said if the deal went ahead there was ""a risk that the institutional framework and safeguards required by the government's security framework may be undermined"". Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement was ""deeply concerning"" and said ""we have yet to see evidence"" that concerns over national security had been mitigated.

Boris Johnson was asked about the takeover while visiting British troops in Estonia When asked if he was comfortable with the takeover, the prime minister said: ""I think it's very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy."" Mr Johnson added: ""A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case, all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others.""

PM serves Christmas lunch to British troopsBoris Johnson will stress the UK commitment to Nato on a visit to the alliance's mission in Estonia.,"The PM served turkey and Yorkshire puddings in the base's canteen Boris Johnson has served Christmas lunch to British troops during a visit to a Nato mission in Estonia. Visiting the Tapa military base near Tallinn, Mr Johnson wished them a merry Christmas as he dished up the meals. The 850 British soldiers based there represent the UK's largest operational deployment in Europe. The PM also stressed the UK's commitment to Nato and its defence of Estonia's eastern border with Russia. The UK is playing a leading role in the alliance's Baltic mission. The troops, from the Queen's Royal Hussars, head the Nato battle group in Estonia, working alongside the country's troops and personnel from France and Denmark. Armed forces 'must cut cloth to match ambition' MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' First of 800 UK troops arrive in Estonia Mr Johnson told them: ""In the course of the next few days, everybody in our country is going to be celebrating Christmas with their families and you're going to be here - a long way away, a pretty cold place. ""What you're doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have Christmas in peace and security is because of what you're doing here. ""What you're doing is showing that Nato works and that Nato is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed to."" Mr Johnson asked the troops what it was like being posted at the Estonian base Mr Johnson addressed troops in a vehicle hangar on the base Downing Street said Mr Johnson also held talks with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas and thanked him for the ""support and hospitality Estonia has shown in hosting British Armed Forces"". The No 10 spokeswoman added: ""The leaders discussed the close partnership between the UK and Estonia, in particular our joint security and defence cooperation. The prime minister reaffirmed the UK's unconditional commitment to Estonia's regional security through Nato. ""The two leaders discussed the need to work together to address shared global challenges and the prime minister invited Prime Minister Ratas to attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next year."" During a four-month deployment earlier this year, a squadron of RAF Typhoon jets was scrambled 21 times to intercept 56 Russian aircraft which had strayed over the border into Estonian airspace. The UK is one of the few Nato countries that meets the commitment to spend at least 2% of national income on defence. The armed forces were given an extra Â£2.2bn in September's spending review when Chancellor Sajid Javid announced a 2.6% increase in defence funding in 2020-1.

"The Scottish schools tackling waste and povertyParty clothes are being shared and swapped, while leftover school meals are sent home with pupils.","When teacher Carrie Smith realised some of her pupils were going hungry, she started sending them home with leftover school meals. The innovative scheme has now been running at Cumnock Academy in Ayrshire for two years and demand remains high. In fact, the initiative has been so successful, it has been rolled out to 12 other schools in East Ayrshire. It is one of a series of simple, effective projects drawn up by schools aimed at tackling poverty and waste. They have first-hand experience of the problems encountered by thealmost one in four children living in poverty in Scotland,external. And according to Zero Waste Scotland, 566,000 tonnes of food are thrown out every year - most of it still edible. Here are some of the initiatives operating at schools across Scotland in a bid to address these twin problems. Carrie Smith (left) founded the scheme at Cumnock Academy Every lunchtime at Cumnock Academy, surplus food is portioned, packaged up and blast-chilled so pupils can take it home the next afternoon. Fresh sandwiches, salad and fruit are also available for young people to pick up that day - all free for every student. It was the brainchild of Ms Smith, the principal teacher for guidance, who became aware that some pupils did not always get three meals a day. And it has proved to be a worthwhile scheme - at Cumnock, all of the food is taken by pupils every day, which ""demonstrates the need for it"", Ms Smith said. In November alone, 1,500 portions of food were taken by pupils at the 13 East Ayrshire schools which have adopted the scheme. The scheme aims reduce hunger amongst its pupils and make lunchtime more sustainable Ms Smith was keen to ensure the service remained ""low key"", to ensure pupils were comfortable picking up the meals. It is not means-tested and there is no requirement for extra staff as they do not keep a record of which pupils are using it. That means the schools can run the project at no extra financial cost to local authority. St Bridget's Primary School in Kilbirnie, North Ayrshire, has been running an initiative to celebrate clean plates and minimise food waste for three years. It started at lunchtime when pupils who ate their meal and left an empty plate were photographed and praised on the schoolTwitter page,externaland in assemblies. The idea has blossomed into part of daily school life at St Bridget's and every child who finishes their hot meal or packed lunch is awarded the title Waste Warrior. Allow Twitter content?

Head teacher Denis Hopkins said it was good for the environment but also meant pupils were being well fed during the day. One Waste Warrior has had their picture taken each lunchtime with a clear plate since starting school in August this year. Parents are also encouraged to tweet pictures of their children from home, restaurants or parties to show off their empty plates. This is to teach children that making important choices about food waste is important wherever they are. Some have tweeted pictures of their kids from all over the world with clean plates in Spain, Greece and even Florida. ""The kids are obsessive about it and the number of families engaged is magic,"" said Mr Hopkins. About one million Christmas jumpers will be purchased this festive season, according to charity Hubbub - despite the fact Scots already own five million. But at one primary school in the Scottish Borders, staff, parents and children are trying to minimise clothing waste this festive season. Christmas jumpers, party dresses and outfits which children have outgrown are being handed in to staff at Jedburgh Primary School. They are then available to collect to parents looking to keep costs down at Christmas. Head teacher Morgan McCreadie said it can be difficult for families to buy new items every year - especially when children grow so quickly. It also encourages families to be more sustainable and reuse items instead of just buying new every December. Stemming the flow of single-use period waste Prom dresses for girls struggling to pay The party clothes donated to the school ""have huge amounts of life left in them"", Ms McCreadie explained. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ""It's wonderful to see schools across Scotland retain the value of the materials to benefit others. ""All too often we consider items, such as surplus food or unwanted clothes, as waste when actually they can be passed on or reused for someone else to enjoy. ""Keeping resources in circulation benefits the planet because it reduces the demand to produce new materials, which can be a significant source of carbon emissions, and enables us to make more of what we already have.""

One defence analyst remarked that it was as if the government rather wanted no-one to notice what had happened. The curious timing may actually draw more attention than if it had been done at a more normal hour - few doubted the government would block the deal, and shareholders in Cobham have already voted overwhelmingly in favour. It says something of the sensitive nature of Cobham's business that much of the published version of the competition regulator's report on the takeover was simply blacked out. In one unedited passage of the report, the Ministry of Defence said if the deal went ahead there was ""a risk that the institutional framework and safeguards required by the government's security framework may be undermined"". Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement was ""deeply concerning"" and said ""we have yet to see evidence"" that concerns over national security had been mitigated. ""If Boris Johnson's government are happy to sell off a leading UK defence and aerospace company to Trump's America, how can we expect his government to protect our defence and manufacturing sectors, not to mention every other sector of our economy, as they negotiate trade deals after Brexit?"" he added. Boris Johnson was asked about the takeover while visiting British troops in Estonia When asked if he was comfortable with the takeover, the prime minister said: ""I think it's very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy."" Mr Johnson added: ""A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case, all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others."" Shonnel Malani, a partner at Advent, said the company took the takeover ""seriously"". ""We are confident the transaction and undertakings being given on national security, jobs and future investment, provide important long-term assurances for both Cobham's employees and customers, particularly in the UK and also globally,"" Mr Malani added. Aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham became a household name in the 1930s Cobham plc is a group of defence and technology businesses which started out as a family firm founded by Sir Alan Cobham. Sir Alan became a flying instructor in 1918 after volunteering to join the Royal Air Force during World War One. He received a knighthood from King George V in 1926 for his pioneering work in aviation. Sir Alan became a household name after devising Cobham's Flying Circus in the early 1930s. The aeronautical acrobatics show toured England and South Africa. He then went on to focus on air-to-air refuelling and formed Flight Refuelling Limited in 1934, which developed into Cobham plc as it is known today. Aside from aviation, Cobham's innovations include lightweight tanks, radar technology for maritime defence and spacecraft technology.

Trump signs off sanctions on Russia gas pipelineThe Trump administration fears the Nord Stream 2 project will increase Russia's influence in Europe.Europe,"This video can not be played Gas wars: The problem with Nord Stream 2 President Donald Trump has signed a law that will impose sanctions on any firm that helps Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, finish a pipeline into the European Union. The sanctions target firms building Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that will allow Russia to increase gas exports to Germany. The US considers the project a security risk to Europe. Both Russia and the EU have strongly condemned the US sanctions. Congress voted through the measures as part of a defence bill last week and the legislation, which described the pipeline as a ""tool of coercion"", was signed off by Mr Trump on Friday. The almost $11bn (Â£8.4bn) Nord Stream 2 project has infuriated the US, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers opposing it. The Trump administration fears the pipeline will tighten Russia's grip over Europe's energy supply and reduce its own share of the lucrative European market for American liquefied natural gas. Skateboarding protesters occupy gas pipeline in Germany EU agrees tighter rules for Russian pipeline President Trump has said the 1,225km (760-mile) pipeline, owned by Russia's Gazprom, could turn Germany into a ""hostage of Russia"". The US sanctions have angered Russia and the European Union, which says it should be able to decide its own energy policies. Earlier this week German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""opposed to extraterritorial sanctions"" against the Nord Stream 2 project. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea has divided Europe and infuriated the US German foreign minister Heiko Maas struck a more combative tone, saying the sanctions amounted to ""interference in autonomous decisions taken in Europe"". Allseas, a Swiss-Dutch company involved in the project, said it had suspended its pipe-laying activities in anticipation of the sanctions. The US sanctions also target TurkStream, a Russia-Turkey pipeline, and include asset freezes and revocation of US visas for the contractors. On Saturday, the EU voiced its clear opposition to the US sanctions. ""As a matter of principle, the EU opposes the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business,"" a spokesman for the trading bloc told AFP news agency. Russia's foreign ministry also strongly opposed the move, with ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing Washington of promoting an ""ideology"" that hinders global competition. The consortium behind Nord Stream 2 confirmed that it would build the pipeline as soon as possible, despite the sanctions. It said: ""Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We, together with the companies supporting the project, will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible."" For years EU member states have been concerned about the bloc's reliance on Russian gas. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EU's gas supplies - just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in its single market. The new pipeline will increase the amount of gas going under the Baltic to 55 billion cubic metres per year. Disagreements among EU nations were so strong that, earlier this year,they even threatened to derail the project entirely. The bloc eventually agreed to strengthen regulations against Nord Stream 2, rather than stop it completely, and to bring it under European control. Businesses in Germany, meanwhile, have invested heavily in the project. Chancellor Merkel has tried to assure Central and Eastern European states that the pipeline would not make Germany reliant on Russia for energy. There is concern in other quarters, too. In May, climate activists opposing the use of fossil fuels occupied part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Germany. The demonstrators, who said the project would be more detrimental to the environment than the authorities had claimed, began skateboarding inside the pipes. Police said at least five people had occupied the pipes near Wrangelsburg in northern Germany.

"MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 JanuaryThe PM says Brexit is ""one step closer"" after MPs back his EU withdrawal bill by a majority of 124.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played MPs approve Brexit deal MPs have backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. They voted 358 to 234 - a majority of 124 - in favour of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, which now goes on to further scrutiny in Parliament. The bill would also ban an extension of the transition period - during which the UK is out of the EU but follows many of its rules - past 2020. The PM said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his MPs to vote against the bill, saying there was ""a better and fairer way"" to leave the EU - but six of them backed the government. Mr Johnson insists a trade deal with the EU can be in place by the end of the transition period, but critics say this timescale is unrealistic. Pienaar: Are we witnessing the birth of Johnsonism?

Read the article in full There are changes to the previous bill, which was backed by the Commons in October, but withdrawn by the government after MPs rejected a three-day deadline for getting it through Parliament. The changes include: Legally prohibiting the government from extending the transition period - during which a trade deal between the UK and EU will be discussed - beyond 31 December 2020 Allowing more UK courts to reconsider European Court of Justice rulings that have been retained in UK law after Brexit Requiring ministers to report annually to Parliament on disputes with the EU under the prime minister's withdrawal agreement Repealing spent legislation that ""now serves no purpose"" The bill also loses a previous clause on strengthening workers' rights.

US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash deathProsecutors said they had started extradition proceedings via the Home Office against Anne Sacoolas.Northampton,"This video can not be played ""A huge step"": Harry's mother reacts to the charge A US woman will be charged with causing the death of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn by dangerous driving. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a road crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had started extradition proceedings through the Home Office. US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK. Lawyer Amy Jefress said: ""Anne will not return voluntarily to the UK to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident."" Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family was ""relieved"" Mrs Sacoolas had ""finally"" been charged. Outside the CPS headquarters she said: ""We feel that we have made a huge step in the start of achieving the promise to Harry that we made. ""We made that promise to him the night we lost him to seek justice thinking it was going to be really easy. ""We had no idea it was going to be so hard and it would take so long."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton where her husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left the UK and returned to her native US, claiming diplomatic immunity. A statement from the US State Department said that at the time of the crash Mrs Saccolas had ""status that conferred diplomatic immunities"" and added the foreign secretary ""stated the same in Parliament"". It added: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an egregious abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent. ""We do not believe that the UK's charging decision is a helpful development."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 A statement via her lawyer said Mrs Sacoolas had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy."" BBC correspondent Duncan Kennedy This has been a tortuous, raw, unrelenting, four months for Harry Dunn's family. They cannot bear to be at the centre of what they regard as an prolonged, unnecessary, international spat between lawyers, diplomats and politicians over what, to them, was a tragic family road accident. Meeting presidents, foreign secretaries and chief constables has been an alien, disorientating experience for them. They sometimes feel that Harry has been forgotten amid all their efforts to keep his case prominent in the minds of those who carry influence. They know that the Home Office will now start the extradition process. They realise that although extradition may take some time, their efforts on behalf of their son now have some meaning. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab previously urged Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK voluntarily Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a review into the immunity arrangements at Croughton for US personnel and their families had concluded. It found that it was an ""anomaly"" that family members had ""greater protection from UK criminal jurisdiction than the officers themselves"". He said he welcomed the decision to charge Mrs Sacoolas. Mr Raab added: ""I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realise the right thing to do is to come back to the UK and cooperate with the criminal justice process."" Chief Crown Prosecutor Janine Smith said it had authorised Northamptonshire Police to charge Mrs Sacoolas. She said the director of public prosecutions had met Mr Dunn's family to explain the decision. The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's parents Tim Dunn and Mrs Charles had previously been critical of the lack of communication from the CPS. His father said on Friday he was ""overwhelmed"" by the CPS's decision. Mr Dunn's parentsrejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trumpto meet Mrs Sacoolas at the White House in October.

"MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 JanuaryThe PM says Brexit is ""one step closer"" after MPs back his EU withdrawal bill by a majority of 124.","This video can not be played MPs approve Brexit deal MPs have backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. They voted 358 to 234 - a majority of 124 - in favour of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, which now goes on to further scrutiny in Parliament. The bill would also ban an extension of the transition period - during which the UK is out of the EU but follows many of its rules - past 2020. The PM said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his MPs to vote against the bill, saying there was ""a better and fairer way"" to leave the EU - but six of them backed the government. Mr Johnson insists a trade deal with the EU can be in place by the end of the transition period, but critics say this timescale is unrealistic. Pienaar: Are we witnessing the birth of Johnsonism? As it happened: Reaction to Brexit vote What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What could Brexit look like by 2021? Brexit bill to give new powers to British judges Government to shut Brexit department on 31 January The bill had been expected to pass easily after the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority at last week's general election. MPs also backed the timetable for further debate on the bill over three days when they return after the Christmas recess - on 7, 8 and 9 January. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive  Those MPs described as ""Did not vote"" may not have done so for a number of reasons. It could be they wished to abstain, or that they had constituency or ministerial business.  The Speaker and his deputies cannot vote and Sinn Fein members traditionally do not vote. The government says it will get the bill into law in time for the 31 January Brexit deadline. The legislation, which would implement theBrexit agreement the prime minister reached with the EUin October, was introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, setting out the government's priorities for the next year. By John Pienaar, deputy political editor ""Getting Brexit done"" turned out to be a useful slogan, and no doubt it helped Boris Johnson win the election. But almost nothing in politics is truly simple - least of all Brexit. Today he passed an historic milestone - but the destination is still some way off. Ruling out any extension to the Brexit transition period might mean Britain leaves with no deal - equally some in government believe it's possible we could see a kind of phased trade deal with the EU, thrashed out over the months and maybe years ahead. Read the article in full There are changes to the previous bill, which was backed by the Commons in October, but withdrawn by the government after MPs rejected a three-day deadline for getting it through Parliament. The changes include: Legally prohibiting the government from extending the transition period - during which a trade deal between the UK and EU will be discussed - beyond 31 December 2020 Allowing more UK courts to reconsider European Court of Justice rulings that have been retained in UK law after Brexit Requiring ministers to report annually to Parliament on disputes with the EU under the prime minister's withdrawal agreement Repealing spent legislation that ""now serves no purpose"" The bill also loses a previous clause on strengthening workers' rights. The government now says it will deal with this issue in a separate piece of legislation, but the TUC has warned that the change will help ""drive down"" working conditions.  June 2016:UK votes to leave European Union in referendum Mar 2017:Government triggers Article 50 to start withdrawal process Nov 2018:EU leaders and Theresa May agree withdrawal deal Jan-Mar 2019:UK Parliament rejects deal three times Oct 2019:New PM Boris Johnson agrees deal with EU Dec 2019:MPs back Johnsonâs Brexit bill by majority 124 votes Beginning the debate in the Commons, the prime minister said his bill ""learns the emphatic lesson of the last Parliament"" and ""rejects any further delay"". ""It ensures we depart on 31 January. At that point Brexit will be done. It will be over,"" he told MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We still believe this is a terrible deal"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the government's ""mishandling of Brexit"" had ""paralysed the political system,"" divided communities and was a ""national embarrassment"". He said MPs ""have to respect the decision"" of the EU referendum in 2016 ""and move on"". ""However, that doesn't mean that we as a party should abandon our basic principles,"" he said. ""Labour will not support this bill, as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU."" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""Scotland still totally and utterly rejects Brexit, yet the prime minister is blindly hurtling towards the cliff edge with these Brexit plans that will leave us poorer, leave us worse off."" On the change in the bill that would legally prohibit the government from extending the transition period beyond 31 December 2020, Mr Blackford said: ""By placing that deadline, that risk of a no-deal Brexit, that we all fear is very much, is on the table again."" And the Democratic Unionist Party's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a ""major contradiction"" in the prime minister's deal ""that causes us great concern"". He said, while it mentioned ""unfettered access"" for Northern Ireland when it comes to trade in the UK, it also had customs arrangements ""that inhibit our ability to have that unfettered access"". In the 2016 referendum, the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. But the subsequent difficulties in getting Brexit through Parliament have caused gridlock at Westminster. An earlier withdrawal agreement - reached between previous PM Mrs May and the EU - was rejected three times by MPs.

MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 January At home, no-one's ever really spoken about Johnsonism. He's maybe been too busy facing challenges and dangers day-to-day, hour-to-hour, for a guiding philosophy to take shape, let alone find a name. But the PM's goal of ending austerity and reuniting the country, north and south, richer and poorer, behind the Tory flag could fairly be described as a new. highly ambitious, political idea. Even so, giving a political mission a name - calling it Johnsonism -  is a lot easier than pulling it off.

PM to serve Christmas lunch to British troops,"The PM served turkey and Yorkshire puddings in the base's canteen Boris Johnson has served Christmas lunch to British troops during a visit to a Nato mission in Estonia. Visiting the Tapa military base near Tallinn, Mr Johnson wished them a merry Christmas as he dished up the meals. The 850 British soldiers based there represent the UK's largest operational deployment in Europe. The PM also stressed the UK's commitment to Nato and its defence of Estonia's eastern border with Russia. The UK is playing a leading role in the alliance's Baltic mission. The troops, from the Queen's Royal Hussars, head the Nato battle group in Estonia, working alongside the country's troops and personnel from France and Denmark. Armed forces 'must cut cloth to match ambition' MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' First of 800 UK troops arrive in Estonia Mr Johnson told them: ""In the course of the next few days, everybody in our country is going to be celebrating Christmas with their families and you're going to be here - a long way away, a pretty cold place. ""What you're doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have Christmas in peace and security is because of what you're doing here. ""What you're doing is showing that Nato works and that Nato is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed to."" Mr Johnson asked the troops what it was like being posted at the Estonian base Mr Johnson addressed troops in a vehicle hangar on the base Downing Street said Mr Johnson also held talks with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas and thanked him for the ""support and hospitality Estonia has shown in hosting British Armed Forces"". The No 10 spokeswoman added: ""The leaders discussed the close partnership between the UK and Estonia, in particular our joint security and defence cooperation. The prime minister reaffirmed the UK's unconditional commitment to Estonia's regional security through Nato. ""The two leaders discussed the need to work together to address shared global challenges and the prime minister invited Prime Minister Ratas to attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next year."" During a four-month deployment earlier this year, a squadron of RAF Typhoon jets was scrambled 21 times to intercept 56 Russian aircraft which had strayed over the border into Estonian airspace. The UK is one of the few Nato countries that meets the commitment to spend at least 2% of national income on defence. The armed forces were given an extra Â£2.2bn in September's spending review when Chancellor Sajid Javid announced a 2.6% increase in defence funding in 2020-1. But a prolonged squeeze on defence spending between 2010 and 2015 has prompted questions about whether the UK is adequately equipped to meet future security threats. In February, the Public Accounts Committee, the House of Commons' spending watchdog, reported that the MoD faced a Â£7bn black hole in its 10-year-plan to equip the armed forces. In aBBC interview on Thursday,Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said there was a shortfall of funding in the MoD's budget and confirmed he had recently met with Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings about improving the way the department spends its money.
