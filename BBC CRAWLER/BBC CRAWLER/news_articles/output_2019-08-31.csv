Woman's throat slashed in early hours attack,"The woman was helped in the street by neighbours A woman is critically ill in hospital after her throat was slashed by an attacker at her home in Glasgow. Police said the 31-year-old was assaulted at a flat in Pollokshaws Road at about 01:15. It is being treated as attempted murder. Eyewitnesses heard the woman's husband screaming for help as he tried to get her to hospital. A neighbour tried to stem the bleeding, while another neighbour comforted the woman's six-year-daughter. An eyewitness told the BBC News website: ""A man ran down Pollokshaws Road shouting for an ambulance because someone had cut his wife's throat. Two neighbours came to his aid and called 999. ""The man went into a nearby flat and brought his wife out to a car - her neck and scarf were soaked in blood. ""One neighbour put pressure on the woman's neck while the other took the couple's young daughter back indoors away from the scene - the man and girl were obviously very distressed. ""The police and ambulance came and taped off the flat and car. They treated the woman while she sat in the car then took her away in an ambulance. It was awful to see, I've heard she's in critical condition and I just hope she and her family recover from this horrific trauma."" A police spokesperson said the woman had been taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and remains in a critical condition. ""We are treating the incident as attempted murder and officers are following a positive line of inquiry,"" she added. Do you know this pooch?

Lomachenko beats Campbell in thrillerVasyl Lomachenko produces a battling display to beat Britain's Luke Campbell on points and add the WBC lightweight title to his WBA and WBO belts.,"Lomachenko was taken the distance for only the fifth time as a professional Vasyl Lomachenko produced a battling display to beat Britain's Luke Campbell on points and add the WBC lightweight title to his WBA and WBO belts. Lomachenko, 31, regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers, was made to work hard for the thrilling win. Campbell, also 31, was aiming to become a world champion for the first time but was floored in the 11th as the Ukrainian's class proved decisive. Lomachenko got the verdict 119-108, 119-108, 118-108 at London's O2 Arena. Campbell v Lomachenko reaction & analysis Costello & Bunce podcast: Frampton, Hearn, Lomachenko post-fight reaction Edwards title fight declared no contest after late punch Latest boxing results & schedule Campbell, an Olympic gold medallist in 2012, suffered the third loss of his 23-fight professional career but deserves huge praise for the way he fought back to hear the final bell. ""He is so good, he adapts to any plans,"" said Campbell. ""Tonight was not the jackpot but my time will come."" The Hull man was in trouble at the end of the fifth when he was caught by a crushing left hook and then a barrage of body and head shots, but was saved by the bell. Campbell took more punishment in the sixth, but had success of his own later in that round and the next in a captivating contest. He was floored in the 11th after a barrage of body shots and then a jab. But he got up to finish the fight, although two of the three judges only gave him a round, with the other judge giving him two. Campbell was later taken to hospital but promoter Eddie Hearn said it was only a precautionary measure. Lomachenko's powerful work to the body repeatedly caused Campbell problems A sold-out crowd at the O2 Arena witnessed another fantastic, dominant performance from Lomachenko, a three-weight world champion. This latest victory - in only his 15th fight as a professional - means he now holds three of the main four belts in the lightweight division - Ghana's Richard Commey, the IBF champion, is the man standing between him and being undisputed champion. Lomachenko has also held world titles at featherweight and super-featherweight after an incredible amateur career that saw him win 396 out of 397 bouts and also win Olympic gold medals in Beijing in 2008 and in London four years later. Now, less than five miles from where he won that second gold medal and in his first professional fight in Europe, Lomachenko dazzled from the off. Before the fight, Hearn said it was an ""honour"" to get the Ukrainian to fight in the UK - and he did not disappoint. The right jab proved a constant menace and the left was dangerous, twice rocking Campbell's head back as early as the third round. He also provided some brutal body shots, leaving Campbell wincing in pain in the fourth. Lomachenko told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He has big amateur experience, he's a smart fighter, a technical fighter and you saw his reach so of course it was hard for me. ""He gave me a good experience and a good fight. I want a unification fight for the four belts."" In the build-up to this fight, legendary promoter Bob Arum said Lomachenko was the greatest technical fighter in boxing since Muhammad Ali and afterwards also compared him to other greats including Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Floyd Mayweather, Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao. So to go the distance shows what a gutsy effort it was from Campbell. This was his second world title shot after he lost on a controversial split decision against Jorge Linares in the US in September 2017. On that occasion, Campbell, whose father died two weeks before the fight, was knocked down in the second but fought back, and later insisted he won the fight by a two-round margin. But against Lomachenko it never looked likely that Campbell, a 10-1 underdog, would get the victory, as the Ukrainian was too good, despite the Briton being two inches taller and having a five-inch reach advantage. Lomachenko was fighting a British opponent for only the second time, after knocking out former world champion Anthony Crolla in the fourth round in the US earlier this year. Campbell managed to go the distance, but a shock win was not to happen. Lomachenko wants to become undisputed world champion Former world champion Carl Frampton:""I never expected that. It was down to Luke Campbell who showed such skill alongside grit and determination. His stock has risen dramatically tonight even though he is the loser. I think Lomachenko underplayed how hard that was. I think it's the toughest fight he has had as a professional."" BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello:""Three of the four versions of the title now rest with Vasyl Lomachenko. But people who haven't seen it won't realise how hard he has had to work for it."" BBC Radio 5 Live boxing expert Steve Bunce:""We came for sorcery and were given a display of old-fashioned grit, determination and heart and desire. Such bravery, such guts. The points mean nothing.

When just Â£13K bought a house in this chic seaside town," By Paul Kerley        Charlie Chatwood and Tacita French met on dating app Tinder two years ago and now want to buy a house. Together they earn £43,500 - just above the average (median) for a couple in their mid-20s. They could get a joint mortgage of about £160,000 - between three and four times their gross income. But even with a hefty deposit, they would struggle to buy anything. They live in West Sussex where - according to property websites - average homes sell for about £375,000. And while they would love to live in nearby Brighton, they know that’s just not possible in 2019. But could they have bought there in years gone by? With an economist, historian and personal finance expert guiding them, Charlie and Tacita travelled back in time to five Friday paydays from the past. How far would our couple’s money have stretched?   The bay windows, high ceilings and feature fireplaces of period properties - so cherished by house-hunters today - were not what first-time buyers wanted in 1968. Flat-fronted, angular, box-like homes were all the rage. “There was still a post-war feeling that old stuff was still a bit bad – and that modernity, and modern houses, would make things better,” says historian Prof Claire Langhamer from the University of Sussex. She is helping paint a picture of what life was like for couples in their mid-to-late 20s in all the years visited by Charlie and Tacita. It was an aspirational time - but those aspirations could not always be fulfilled. “There were women's and DIY magazines showcasing these beautiful shiny new homes with really bright vibrant colours and modern furniture – but that wasn’t really what a lot of people were experiencing day-to-day.” In 1968, about one-eighth of all homes still lacked basic amenities - like baths, hot water and indoor toilets. It was the end of a decade when housebuilding had mattered - with city slums cleared for new tower blocks and the creation of fresh waves of post-war new towns. 1968 remains the peak post-war year for housebuilding, with more than 425,000 new-builds completed across the UK.      In Brighton that night, three big stories were on the front page of the local paper – the Evening Argus. Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of US president John F Kennedy, was about to remarry. Beatle John Lennon - with his “Japanese artist friend” Yoko Ono - had been arrested in London for possessing cannabis. And runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos had been suspended from the US Olympic team after their “Black Power” demonstration. Inside the paper, there were dozens of homes for sale - and the idea that “new was good” was very evident. A two bedroom flat in a new 10-storey block of flats on Worthing seafront was priced at £5,150. The same money would have bought a new three bedroom semi about 10 miles from Brighton - on Wimpey Homes’ Roman Way Estate in Burgess Hill. The newspaper advert lists the benefits of buying brand-new. New homes featured an immersion heater, veneered internal doors and plastic rainwater pipes and gutters. £5,150 in today’s money is just over £65,000. The price tag may sound cheap, but wages were much lower compared with today’s earnings.     “In many ways 1968 seems even further away from us now than it really is,” says economist Jonathan Cribb from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. People were generally poorer than they are today, he says, and the role of women in society was also very different - with many not having the means to be financially independent. Statistics from the IFS reveal that of the 84% of twenty-somethings in a couple, 83% would have been married. “The average age of marriage for women was about 22 - but working-class women got married even earlier,” says  Claire Langhamer. Marriage was the life event that validated relationships and made home-owning possible. That was especially true for women, who often couldn’t get a mortgage or credit without a male guarantor. And the general limited availability of credit - for men and women - meant that people had to plan ahead for big purchases. “People saved for their ‘bottom drawer’ ready for when they got married,” says Claire. But most parents of the 1968 first-time buyers would not have been in a position to help much financially. They would have been born in the 1920s and 30s. “We’re not talking about a very rich generation,” says Jonathan. In 1968, nearly all men in their mid-20s would have been in work - about 97%. Roughly  60% of couples that age had children and 45% of women had jobs - though many of the positions on offer did not pay well.       Tacita is not impressed by some of the job ads in the Argus. “Women were still really corralled into low-pay, low-status jobs,” says Claire Langhamer. “But employers did want to get them into the workplace.” Millions of Britons – somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters – did not have a bank current account in 1968. To get a mortgage, a couple like Tacita and Charlie would have probably opened a savings account at a local building society – to build up a deposit – and then applied for a home loan at that branch. “And even then, some people would have to wait for months,” says personal finance expert Prof Sharon Collard from the University of Bristol. “Building societies generally only lent money they actually had. Financial services hadn’t yet opened up to the international money markets.” In 1968, our couple would have a combined gross income of £1,500 a year.     ·          Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of £43,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s ·          In 1968, a couple in a similar position would have an estimated gross income of £1,500 – that’s £19,000 in today’s money ·          After saving a rough 20% deposit, they could borrow about £2,750 at an interest rate of 7.6% ·          In 1968, they could buy a property costing about £3,400 – that’s just over £43,000 in today’s money Sources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England Tacita and Charlie look through the Evening Argus. What would £3,400 get them? There is a fair selection of affordable properties in Brighton and Hove - flats and small houses. But most are older style properties - not so fashionable at the time - and they may not have had mod cons. “Well that's a hell of a lot of house for not very much money,” says Charlie of the terraced house close to the station. “Potentially your forever home.” The couple are curious why homes in 1968 seem more affordable, when their 1968 earnings would have been - comparatively - less than half of what they take home today. “So why can’t we buy a house now?” asks Charlie. “Fundamentally it's because your real income has doubled - plus a bit more - since 1968. But house prices have gone up about fivefold,” says Jonathan Cribb. “And in that sense, 1968 would seem easier for a couple like you than it does today. But I don't think we should underestimate all of those difficulties of a much poorer society – they make day-to-day life much harder.”   LISTEN:Charlie and Tacita travel back to 1968- when Mary Hopkin, Marvin Gaye and Tom Jones were in the charts And then jump forward with them to the late 1970s… Getting on the housing ladder would have been more of a challenge for our couple at the end of the 1970s. Yes, progress towards equality meant Tacita would be much more likely to be earning a wage than 11 years before, but the mid-to-late 70s had been a white-knuckle economic rollercoaster. And to top it off, the cost of borrowing had just become the most expensive it had ever been. That Friday was when mortgage rates rose from 11.75% to 15% for first-time buyers - as a result of the Bank of England raising its base rate to 17%. Existing borrowers would - according to the Building Societies Association - have to pay 15% from January 1980. The cost of everything seemed to be going up fast. UK inflation was running at about 13%-14% - explains economist Jonathan Cribb - down from a high of 25% in 1975. In 2019, the rate is about 2%. “You would go to the shops every couple of weeks and visibly see those prices going up. But you’d still have the same one-pound note in your pocket,” he says. Charlie – born in 1992 – raises an eyebrow. “I can see that people's quality of life was certainly decreasing rapidly - and if wages weren't rising too, that would have caused discontent.” Between 1968 and 1979, the cost of some basic food items rose considerably. In pre-decimal 1968 - when prices were displayed in pounds, shillings and pence - a pint of milk cost 10 old pence, or 10d. That works out at just over 4p when converted into the decimal system. By 1979 it cost nearly 15p - a price increase of about 275%.       If Charlie and Tacita had decided to have a cheap night in front of the TV that Friday, they would have had a choice of only three channels. Southern Television, the local ITV company, had the quiz 3-2-1. On BBC Two, there was a new series of Better Badminton. While on BBC One, viewers could enjoy an episode of the sitcom Are You Being Served? The irony is that from midnight that evening, television viewing would also become more expensive. “£9 is slapped on the cost of colour viewing - TV Licence Bombshell,” read the main headline on the Evening Argus newspaper. The cost of a colour licence was rising from £25 to £34, and a black and white one from £10 to £12. With prices for basic items rising fast, sales staff needed to work harder to get people to spend money on big ticket items. Among the car adverts for Morris Marinas, Triumph Dolomites and Ford Cortinas, one garage was offering coupons for 50 gallons of petrol with every used vehicle sold. “People would’ve been spending a lot of money on basic goods, so that explains why salesmen are offering coupons - some kind of incentive,” says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. In 1979, a gallon of four-star leaded petrol cost 98p - that’s about 22p a litre (86p in today’s money). But the 1970s witnessed not only economic turbulence, but also moves towards equality. “It was perhaps the most equal of the decades we’re looking at, with the differential between the richest and the poorest in society at its smallest,” explains Claire Langhamer. “There were discussions around women’s equality and gay rights. There was a tangible sense of change in the way people wanted to be.” Trade union strikes may have made the news almost daily, but our experts agree that 1979 offered more job security for a greater number of people than today. “There were still large numbers of people in relatively stable public sector employment. National industries offered a sense of a collective welfare,” says Sharon Collard.     Council houses made up just under a third of all UK homes in 1979 – some 6.5 million properties. “The fact that it was just about the peak year for rentals from local authorities really mattered,” says Claire Langhamer. “If you were young and in need of a home, that would make the whole situation feel a little less precarious than it does now.” As a couple in their mid-to-late 20s, the likelihood is that Charlie and Tacita would be married with a child in 1979 - similar to 1968. But significantly, Tacita would be much more likely to be working than in the late 1960s. By 1979, 60% of young adult women were in work, compared with only 45% in 1968. A 15 percentage point increase in just over a decade. The Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 should also have let Tacita get a mortgage in her own name, without the need for a male guarantor. And a relaxation of the marriage law in England and Wales, at the start of the 1970s, made it easier for couples to split. “This shift to treat marriages more like relationships - rather than an institution at the heart of society - was really crucial,” says Claire Langhamer. “The housing situation changed. When a relationship ended, you might have needed two houses rather than one.” So how much did homes cost in 1979? The average house price in England was approaching £17,000 – and the North-South divide was not so extreme as today. In London an average property cost £22,000. In Yorkshire, the figure was £13,000. And about £13,000 was the amount Charlie and Tacita could have afforded in Brighton - with their income of £6,000.       ·      Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of £43,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s ·      In 1979, a couple in a similar position would have an estimated gross income of £6,000 – that’s about £23,300 in today’s money ·      After saving for an average 15% deposit, they could borrow about £11,000 at an interest rate of 15% ·      In 1979, they could buy a property costing about £12,900 – that’s about £50,200 in today’s money Sources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England “You’d be paying a mortgage interest rate of 15%. Those monthly payments would be quite steep, more than 35% of your take-home pay,” says economist Jonathan Cribb. “However, the accompanying high inflation would have helped reduce the value of what you owed quite quickly, and your wages - in cash terms at least - would have risen steadily. So the real value of your mortgage debt would be gradually reducing.” Charlie and Tacita look through the Evening Argus. What could they have bought? The affordable homes are smaller than those in 1968.  “It doesn't look as good as 1968 but there are some pretty reasonable flats – and still more doable than now,” says Charlie. “Not only is it more affordable in relation to what our income would have been, but it sounds as though we could have expected better long-term job security. Today, there is no golden ticket.”   LISTEN:Charlie and Tacita travel back to 1979- when Abba, Queen and The Jam were in the charts And then jump forward with them to the late 1980s… By the late 1980s, our couple would be wealthier - with enough money to pay for big hairstyles and fashionable clothes. But with house prices rising fast in southern England, would they have been priced out of the market? Many of today’s social inequalities, in terms of geography and income, really became much more stark in the 1980s - says economist Jonathan Cribb. “It was the decade when - relatively - the rich did better than the middle, the middle did better than the poor, and the South did better than the North.” That Friday, Labour leader Neil Kinnock attacked Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s monetarist, free-market policies – accusing her of creating a “speculators’ paradise”. He used the catchphrase of Harry Enfield’s comic character - Loadsamoney. “The money’s only here for the money… not loadsaproduction, not loadsajobs - just loadsamoney,” he told the Welsh Labour Party. “We’ve got the loadsamoney economy. And behind that comes loadsatrouble.” On the news that night, Margaret Thatcher responded robustly. “Our policies have created the wealth which we have then been able to distribute… everyone has benefitted.” In May 1988, parts of the UK - the traditional industrial areas away from London - were still experiencing the after-effects of the early 1980s recession. When they came to power in 1979, the Conservatives had grappled with high inflation, high interest rates and a strong pound. Unemployment rose sharply. But a couple like Charlie and Tacita, living in a relatively prosperous part of the country, would probably have both been in work. Their personal finances would have risen by about 40% since 1979 - even after inflation - says Jonathan Cribb. And their increased wealth would have boosted their purchasing power.         That Friday, our couple may well have gone to the cinema to see Three Men and a Baby, The Last Emperor or Wall Street. “Partly, that leisure spending was being supported by massive growth in consumer credit – people using credit cards,” says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. She explains how the financial industry could “breathe” more by the end of the decade. “Until 1980, there was the so-called ‘bank corset’ which kept lending within specific Bank of England limits. It was removed by the Chancellor Geoffrey Howe. The government wanted to open up the market to international flows of money. “It was a time when banking became sexy. Big bonuses, long lunches, wine bars – a nice lifestyle.” The 80s also offered ordinary people the chance to invest. “You know these British Gas shares? They’re really easy to do,” went the 1986 TV ad. “If you see Sid, tell him!” No-one ever saw Sid, but the British Gas privatisation campaign worked. “Individuals were being positioned - almost whether they wanted to be or not - as financial experts over their own lives,” says historian Claire Langhamer. “It was the idea everybody should’ve been thinking how to make lucky investments. And it really was luck. It's all historical accident - where you end up - when you can buy a house - if you have cash to buy shares.” By 1988, fewer people of Charlie and Tacita’s age cohabited. About 60% of twenty-somethings lived with a partner, down from 80% in 1979.        So how did the 1988 housing market stack up? Average house prices between 1979 and 1988 had risen by 200%. Even accounting for inflation they were up 75%, says Jonathan Cribb. And 1988 remains the year - according to Office for National Statistics figures dating from 1980 - that saw the greatest annual UK house price inflation. Prices rose by 25.6%. But the North-South divide was widening. At the time, the Building Societies Association cited three reasons as to why it was happening. Firstly, lower unemployment rates in the South meant there was greater purchasing power. Secondly, City bonuses were being used to buy property in London. And thirdly, the completion of the M25 motorway had improved transport links in the South East. It was also easier to get a mortgage. With more banks in the market, more products were available. And deposits, proportionally, were getting smaller. “We saw high loan to value. Lower deposits and sometimes no deposit whatsoever,” says Sharon Collard. “It was a crazy time.” The Conservatives’ Right to Buy policy also limited the availability of social housing – putting more pressure on the private sector. Council tenants could buy their properties at a discount – with restrictions placed on the number of new homes local authorities could build. The policy “did give a lot of housing wealth to people who had none before”, says Jonathan Cribb. People began to see houses as investments rather than just homes, says Claire Langhamer. In 1988, Charlie and Tacita’s joint income would have been £15,000.      ·      Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of £43,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s ·      In 1988, a couple in a similar position would have an estimated gross income of about £15,000 – that’s just over £33,000 in today’s money ·      After saving for an average 5% deposit, they could borrow a little over £33,000 at an interest rate of about 9.8% ·      In 1988, they could buy a property costing roughly £35,000 – that’s about £77,500 in today’s money Sources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England  But Charlie and Tacita’s £35,000 budget would not have stretched very far in Brighton. In property pages, there is nothing that cheap - although a few studio flats come close.  “We're looking at the real lower end,” says Tacita, “which is interesting because in 1979, with £13,000, that would have bought us a flat. And in 1968 we’d have got a house. It's changed quite a lot.” “But the ratio of income to house price is still such that we may have been able to save and get something better,” says Charlie. “I'm guessing what people did was compromise and buy a bedsit,” says Sharon Collard. “But they’d think, ‘Because of house price inflation it's only going to be a few years before we can trade up.’”       LISTEN:Charlie and Tacita travel back to 1988- when Belinda Carlisle, S-Express and New Order were in the charts And then jump forward with them to the late 1990s…   The political landscape of the UK had been radically redrawn overnight. The Conservatives were out and Tony Blair’s New Labour were in. As John Major left Downing Street that morning, he told news crews that Britain was “in far better shape” than when he had become prime minister in 1990. The economy did seem to be in a good place. “Inflation was about 2%, employment was rising fast, unemployment was falling - you had a kind of sweet spot,” says economist Jonathan Cribb. Average house prices in England were just over £60,000 - about 20% lower than the late 1980s, adjusting for price inflation.     Could 1997 be a good year for our first-time buyers Charlie and Tacita? It certainly looks more promising than a few years earlier, when the 1980s housing bubble burst, interest rates soared again and the country headed into recession. Many first-time buyers who had bought in the boom found themselves in negative equity - and owed more to the bank or building society than their home was actually worth. “Negative equity was a national shock to the system,” says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. “We have a persistent view that bricks and mortar are the safe investment - but in 1992 alone, 75,000 families had their homes repossessed.” In general though, says Jonathan Cribb, the early 1990s slump was not as hard-hitting as the early 1980s recession. “Economically, it's not something that took years to recover from.” But for a few who had lost their jobs and got redundancy payouts - investing in property looked an attractive option. Specific buy-to-let mortgages were launched. “It was the idea that housing wealth created more wealth,” says Sharon Collard. “If you could afford a house, you could afford a second house. And you could rent out that second house to pay towards your retirement.” Despite the house price falls and negative equity at the start of the 1990s, average deposits in 1997 for first-time buyers were only about 5% - and there was still the option of 100% mortgages. By the late 1990s - 75% of women in their mid-to-late 20s would be working, about a third would have a child and about 60% would be living with a partner. That’s not too far off today’s figures says Jonathan Cribb. Our couple’s wages would have grown since 1988, but at a slower rate than the 80s boom years. Between them in 1997, they would earn about £24,000.    ·      Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of £43,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s ·      In 1997, a couple in a similar position would have a gross income of £24,000 - that’s just over £37,000 in today’s money ·      After saving for an estimated 5% deposit, they could borrow about £57,000 at an interest rate of about 6.5% ·      In 1997, they could buy a property costing nearly £60,000 - that’s nearly £93,000 in today’s money Sources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England “Your 1997 budget of nearly £60,000 is roughly back at the national average house price – just like in 1968,” explains Jonathan. Looking through that night’s “election special” edition of the Evening Argus, Charlie and Tacita are pleasantly surprised. There’s an abundance of choice. They could have had their pick of flats across Brighton and Hove - and even stretch to a house.  “We’re looking really good in 1997,” says Charlie. “Of all the decades so far, would this have been the best one for us to have bought a house?” “You're going to get me as close to saying ‘Yes’ for an economist, as you're going to get me to say,” jokes Jonathan. In 1997, the average house price was roughly two-and-a-half times the average income for people in their mid-to-late 20s - similar to 1968. “But you would have been so much richer in 1997 than you would have been in the late 1960s,” says Jonathan. “And the standard of homes was better - you’d be more likely to have central heating or double glazing.”         For women, says historian Claire Langhamer, there is a clear winner. “There’d been that shift in women's financial autonomy, earning capacity and lack of reliance on marriage. In the unhappy event of you two splitting up in 1997, then you, Tacita, would have been able to buy a home on your own.”     LISTEN:Charlie and Tacita travel back to 1997- when D:Ream, Blur and the Spice Girls were in the charts And then jump forward with them to the late noughties…   The UK economy had been going backwards - shrinking - for over a year. The deepest recession since World War Two was just about over, although its effects were still being felt. “We really had a true global financial crisis,” explains economist Jonathan Cribb to our couple Tacita and Charlie - who were aged 14 and 16 at the time. “We hit the credit crunch in slow motion. In the UK, the bank Northern Rock got into trouble in late 2007, and then all hell broke loose in the autumn of 2008 with Lehman Brothers going bust.” Companies laid off staff, froze pay or shortened working hours to try to survive. The flow of money around the economy slowed - access to credit was restricted. And that fed through into the housing market.    House prices, which had risen steadily since the mid-1990s, had been falling in the recession. But this time, unlike in 1997, there was no sweet spot. “For prospective house-buyers like yourselves, 2009 was a funny place,” says Jonathan. In August 2009, the average house price in the south-east of England was just above £206,000. “House prices in real terms had grown by 120% since our last year - 1997. But incomes were up by only 25%. That made it a lot harder to buy a house,” he says. The Great Recession - as it is now known - also had a greater impact on young people than older generations. Twenty-somethings suffered the biggest falls in earnings and higher unemployment rates. Companies tightened their belts and stopped hiring. The late 1990s and first half of the 2000s had seen house prices soar, particularly in the most crowded part of the UK - London and the South East. Demand was outstripping supply. Buy-to-let and overseas investors continued to look for property alongside traditional house-hunters. “And we start to see television shows like Homes Under the Hammer - about selling your house to make a profit,” says historian Claire Langhamer.      Fewer homes were also being built. Housebuilding figures fluctuated around the 200,000-a-year mark at the start of the noughties - less than half the total in 1968. By 2009, the number of completed dwellings in the UK had dropped to 157,000. And during the 2009 credit crunch, for those young buyers living in expensive parts of the country, getting a mortgage would also have been tricky. “There was a massive contraction of mortgage lending,” says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. “Loan to value of 75% became fairly standard. You’d need a 25% deposit - a big chunk of money. Lenders’ appetites for risk had completely collapsed - and the regulators forced them to become more responsible for their lending.” The tough conditions are borne out infigures on home ownershipfrom the Resolution Foundation think tank. In the south-east of England between 1988 and 2009, home ownership among 25 to 34-year-olds fell from 58% to 36%. By 2018 it had dropped further – to under 30%. But for those young people able to get on the 2009 housing ladder, there was one “saving grace” says Jonathan Cribb. Record low interest rates. “This was the point where the gap between renters and owner-occupiers opened up. Rents had increased over the decade, and when the Bank of England cut interest rates to keep the economy afloat, that brought mortgage rates down. “Those who did get a home benefitted from very cheap credit.” Charlie and Tacita wonder about their August 2009 earnings. Looking at his spreadsheet, Jonathan says a young couple like them - earning slightly above average wages - would have earned about £37,000. In today’s money, that’s almost £46,000 - and more than they currently earn. “It means over the past 10 years young people's earnings have actually fallen back a bit - one of the reasons why it’s so hard to buy in 2019,” says Jonathan.      ·        Tacita and Charlie have a 2019 gross income of £43,500, which is slightly above average for couples in their mid-20s ·         In 2009, a couple in a similar position would have an estimated gross income of £37,000 - that’s nearly £46,000 in today’s money ·         After saving for an estimated 25% deposit, they could borrow about £116,000 at an interest rate of 3.9% ·         In 2009, they could buy a property costing about £155,000 - that’s roughly £192,000 in today’s money Sources/calculations: Institute for Fiscal Studies, Savills UK, Building Societies Association, Bank of England   Even if they could have raised a deposit of more than £38,000 - and bought for £155,000 - there are slim pickings in the Evening Argus property pages. Only about half a dozen properties in Brighton would have been affordable.  “The 2009 deposit would definitely have been a problem. The deposit is partly why we have a problem right now,” says Charlie. “People ask me why I haven’t moved out of my mother’s home. I could rent a house in 2019, but I wouldn’t be able to save. Renting and saving at the same time is totally unrealistic.” The present day situation for first-time buyers is an intractable problem, says personal finance expert Sharon Collard. “Some people are doing extremely well out of housing wealth, while others just can’t get on the ladder. And that seems very unfair. There are now at least eight government housing schemes aimed predominantly at helping first-time buyers. That's great, but it just kind of sums it all up doesn’t it?”        And how do Charlie and Tacita feel after their journey back in time? “We came all the way from buying semi-detached houses to barely being able to afford a flat on a leasehold,” says Charlie. “It seems to me that to buy in 2019, you’re either in the North - like one of my friends who has managed it - or you’re down here and you’ve been given some help from parents.” Tacita say she is not depressed by what she learned. “Older generations say it was just as hard back then,” she says. “But I come away from this time trip feeling almost relieved that our hunch was accurate - that we are probably the generation for whom house-buying is the hardest.” The couple doubt they will ever be able to get on the property ladder in the south of England. So what will they do? “We have to look at an alternative route,” says Charlie. “We can’t afford to buy a conventional house.” They are seriously thinking of building a so-called “tiny home” - explains Charlie - a small self-contained eco cabin, possibly on a trailer. “Whatever we do will be a long slog,” adds Tacita. “But we hope to get benefits back in the longer term, with lower bills and no mortgage.”     LISTEN:Charlie and Tacita travel back to 2009- when Lady Gaga, Beyoncéand Dizzee Rascal were in the charts  The figures presented to Charlie and Tacita were for illustrative purposes only.

India puts 1.9m people at risk of statelessness,"This video can not be played India says the process is needed to identify illegal migrants India has published the final version of a list which effectively strips about 1.9 million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. People left off the list will have 120 days to appeal against their exclusion. It is unclear what happens next. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. It has already detained thousands of people suspected of being foreigners in temporary camps which are housed in the state's prisons, but deportation is currently not an option for the country. The process has also sparked criticism of ""witch hunts"" against Assam's ethnic minorities. A draft version of the list published last year had four million people excluded. The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in Assam and is therefore Indian, and who might be a migrant from neighbouring Bangladesh. The register has been updated for the first time. The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in the state and is Indian Families in the state have been required to provide documentation to show their lineage, with those who cannot prove their citizenship deemed illegal foreigners. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long railed against illegal immigration in India but has made the NRC a priority in recent years. By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Assam A small community centre in the village of Katajhar is being guarded by two members of the Indian army. Outside, a line of people wait. Some are clutching plastic bags containing documents. As they enter one of two rooms, an official runs his eyes down a print-out to see if their names or photos are on it.  This list - the National Register of Citizens - is one with huge consequences. And so there's fear and trepidation as people here find out whether they've been included. Many here who haven't made it tell me it's a mistake as they show me paperwork they say proves they belong in this country. None of Asia Khatun's family of nine made the list. They now have the chance to appeal but there's real fear about what might come next. ""I'd rather die than go to a detention centre,"" she tells me. People here are angry but they're also scared. Assam is one India's most multi-ethnic states. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living there. Among its residents are Bengali and Assamese-speaking Hindus, as well as a medley of tribespeople. A third of the state's 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a 4,000-km long border with India, has been a concern there for decades now. The government said in 2016 that an estimated 20 million illegal immigrants were living in India. Not quite. Residents excluded from the list can appeal to the specially formed courts called Foreigners Tribunals, as well as the high court and Supreme Court. However, a potentially long and exhaustive appeals process will mean that India's already overburdened courts will be further clogged, and poor people left off the list will struggle to raise money to fight their cases. Saheb Ali, 55, from Goalpara district, has not been included in the list If people lose their appeals in higher courts, they could be detained indefinitely. Some 1,000 people declared as foreigners earlier are already lodged in six detention centres located in prisons. Mr Modi's  government is also building an exclusive detention centre, which can hold 3,000 detainees. ""People whose names are not on the final list are really anxious about what lies ahead. One of the reasons is that the Foreigners Tribunal does not have a good reputation, and many people are worried that they will have to go through this process,"" Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty, author of Assam: The Accord, The Discord, told the BBC. The special courts were first set up in 1964, and since then they have declared more than 100,000 people foreigners. They regularly identify ""doubtful voters"" or ""illegal infiltrators"" as foreigners to be deported. But the workings of the specially formedForeigners Tribunals,external, which have been hearing the contested cases, have been mired in controversy. There are more than 200 such courts in Assam today, and their numbers are expected to go up to 1,000 by October. The majority of these tribunals were set up after the BJP came to power in 2014. The courts have been accused of bias and their workings have often been opaque and riddled with inconsistencies. This video can not be played Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted For one thing, the burden of proof is on the accused or the alleged foreigner. For another, many families are unable to produce documents due to poor record-keeping, illiteracy or because they lack the money to file a legal claim. People have been declared foreigners by the courts because of differences in spellings of names or ages in voter rolls, and problems in getting identity documents certified by authorities. Amnesty International has described the work by the special courts as ""shoddy and lackadaisical"". Journalist Rohini Mohan analysed more than 500 judgements by these courts,externalin one district and found 82% of the people on trial had been declared foreigners. She also found more Muslims had been declared foreigners, and 78% of the orders were delivered without the accused being ever heard - the police said they were ""absconding"", but Mohan found many of them living in their villages and unaware they had been declared foreigners. ""The Foreigners Tribunal,"" she says, ""must be made more transparent and accountable."" A decorated Indian army veteran,Mohammed Sanaullah spent 11 days in a detention campin June after being declared a ""foreigner"", prompting national outrage. Both the citizen's register and the tribunals have also sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Many say the list has nothing to do with religion, but activists see it as targeting the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. They also point to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Bangladesh. The move to make millions of people stateless will probably spark protests However significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus have also been left off the citizenship list, underscoring the communal and ethnic tensions in the state ""One of the communities worst affected by the list are the Bengali Hindus. There are as many of them in detention camps as Muslims. This is also the reason just days before NRC is to be published the BJP has changed tack, from taking credit for it to calling it error-ridden. That is because the Bengali Hindus are a strong voter base of the BJP,"" says Barooah Pisharoty. Fearing possible loss of citizenship and detention after exclusion from the list,scores of Bengali Hindus and Muslims have killed themselvessince the process to update the citizen register started in 2015, activists say. And in an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. Detainees have complained of poor living conditions and overcrowding in the detention centres. A father and son killed themselves 30 years apart because of citizenship doubts (photo shows funeral) One detainee told a rights group after his release he had been taken to a room which had a capacity for 40 people, but was filled with around 120 people. People who have been declared foreigners as well as many inmateshave been suffering from depression,external. Children have also been detained with their parents. Human rights activist Harsh Mander, who visited two detention centres, has spoken about a situation of ""grave and extensive human distress and suffering"". The BJP which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Many believe that India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo that of the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. It is not clear whether the people stripped of their Indian citizenship will be able to access welfare or own property. One possibility is that once they are released, they will be given work permits with some basic rights, but will not be allowed to vote.

Formula 2 driver Hubert killed in crash,"Hubert was part of Renault's young driver programme Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert has been killed in a crash at the Belgian Grand Prix, motorsport's governing body the FIA has said. The Frenchman, who was 22, suffered a huge impact from the car of American Juan Manuel Correa at about 170mph at the Raidillon swerves. An FIA statement said that Hubert was taken to the medical centre after the incident, and died at 18:35 local time. Correa is in intensive care, but his condition is stable, after surgery. The 20-year-old suffered fractures to both his legs and a ""minor spinal injury"" in the crash and was taken to hospital by helicopter. ""Juan Manuel remained conscious the entire time until his admission to the operating room,"" a statement said. Why the motorsport 'family' races on after a driver pays the ultimate price The race was stopped after the crash and cancelled within a few minutes when the potential seriousness of the accident became clear. Formula 2 have announced that Sunday's sprint race at Spa has been cancelled ""out of respect"", while the Formula 3 race will go ahead. Hubert, who drove for the BWT Arden team, was lying eighth in the championship and had scored two wins this season, in Monaco and France. He was also part of Renault F1's young driver programme. Renault said in a statement: ""Anthoine was a member of the Renault Sport Academy and raced in the FIA Formula 2 Championship, the final ladder to F1. ""As reigning GP3 champion and member of the Equipe de France, FFSA (French Federation of Motorsport), the Frenchman was a huge talent who also brought great energy and positivity to his championship, his teams and the Renault Sport Academy. ""His smile and sunny personality lit up our formidable group of young drivers, who had formed tight and enduring bonds. ""His strong results in F2 this season, including wins on home soil in Monaco and France, inspired not just the other recruits but also the wider Renault Sport Racing group."" Other racing drivers and teams from across motorsport have paid tribute on social media. Former F1 driver Fernando Alonso posted on Twitter: ""What a sad afternoon. I have no words. It hurts the heart. Rest in peace, champ."" Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: ""This is devastating. God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today. ""If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe your hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough. ""Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport. Anthoine is a hero as far as I'm concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I'm so sad that this has happened. Let's left him up and remember him. Rest in peace brother."" Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi said on Twitter: ""We are boys who, with great sacrifice, chase their dreams. But we are first and foremost professionals.

Dorian strengthens to category 4 hurricaneForecasters warn it could be the most powerful storm to hit the US south-east coast in decades.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian is heading towards Florida - the governor warns of a 'multi-day event'. A powerful storm threatening the Bahamas and south-eastern coast of the US has grown to category four, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. Hurricane Dorian has maximum sustained winds of nearly 145mph (225km/h). It is expected to grow even stronger, its centre potentially crossing the Bahamas before skirting Florida's east coast early next week. Reports from the Bahamas described tourists scrambling to leave before the closure of the international airport. States of emergency have been declared in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina. Residents have been urged to stock enough food, water and medicine to last at least a week. Forecasters warn Dorian could be the region's worst storm since category five Hurricane Andrew killed 65 people and destroyed 63,000 homes in 1992. US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring Dorian,which he described as ""an extremely dangerous storm"" on Twitter,external. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Hurricanes, whose strength can range from category 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, tend to get stronger as they move over warm waters like those off Florida. By the middle of next week, forecasters expect Dorian to shift eastwards, putting the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina at risk. The NHC said ""life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds, and heavy rains capable of life-threatening flash floods"" are expected to hit the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama on Sunday. Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas' Department of Meteorology, said storm surges of up to 15ft (4.5m) were expected.

Dorian strengthens to category 4 hurricane,"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian is heading towards Florida - the governor warns of a 'multi-day event'. A powerful storm threatening the Bahamas and south-eastern coast of the US has grown to category four, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. Hurricane Dorian has maximum sustained winds of nearly 145mph (225km/h). It is expected to grow even stronger, its centre potentially crossing the Bahamas before skirting Florida's east coast early next week. Reports from the Bahamas described tourists scrambling to leave before the closure of the international airport. States of emergency have been declared in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina. Residents have been urged to stock enough food, water and medicine to last at least a week. Forecasters warn Dorian could be the region's worst storm since category five Hurricane Andrew killed 65 people and destroyed 63,000 homes in 1992. US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring Dorian,which he described as ""an extremely dangerous storm"" on Twitter,external. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Hurricanes, whose strength can range from category 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, tend to get stronger as they move over warm waters like those off Florida. By the middle of next week, forecasters expect Dorian to shift eastwards, putting the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina at risk. The NHC said ""life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds, and heavy rains capable of life-threatening flash floods"" are expected to hit the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama on Sunday. Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas' Department of Meteorology, said storm surges of up to 15ft (4.5m) were expected.

Sturgeon condemns Glasgow 'sectarian' disorderThe first minister hits out after riot police were called to clashes at an Irish Unity march in Govan.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Roads were blocked as a result of the demonstrations Nicola Sturgeon has condemned ""sectarian disruption"" at a march in Glasgow as ""utterly unacceptable"". Riot police, a helicopter and dog units were called in when an Irish Unity march in Govan was met by hundreds of ""disruptive"" counter demonstrators. Roads were blocked in what police described as ""significant disorder"" on Friday evening. Glasgow City Council said it planned to stop ""morons intent on bringing mayhem to the streets of our city"". Two men, aged 37 and 21, have been arrested and charged following the incident. Police Scotland has said it will undertake a ""thorough and robust"" review of the events. The Irish Unity march, led by the James Connolly Republican Flute Band, set off from Elder Park, Govan, at 18:30 but was soon met by a counter demonstration of ""several hundred people"" from loyalist groups.

Buyers express interest in nationalised shipyard,"A number of potential private buyers have expressed an interest in the nationalised Ferguson shipyard. Administrators for the Port Glasgow yard have held talks with several potential buyers and said they were ""encouraged"" by the interest so far. The shipyard is operating under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy Ferguson if no private buyer comes forward. About 300 people work at the yard. Fergusonwent into administrationfollowing a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - which buys and leases CalMac ships on behalf of the Scottish government - over the construction of two Â£97m ferries. Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has said details of a ""robust delivery schedule"" for the CalMac ferries must be announced by the end of October. The Glen Sannox vessel has been awaiting completion at the yard since its launch The Scottish government has made two loans to Ferguson Marine, totalling Â£45m, and what happens to these remains unclear. A spokesman for joint administrator Deloitte, who refused to be drawn on how many interested parties the firm had spoken to, said it was working hard to determine if a commercially-viable solution for the yard could be identified. He added: ""The joint administrators are undertaking a sale process and are actively engaged in discussions with a number of potentially-interested parties, however it is early in the process and therefore it is not appropriate for us to comment further at this stage. ""We have been encouraged by the level of interest in the yard so far but would encourage any remaining parties who may have an interest to contact us."" An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a very public dispute which ended with Ferguson Marine going into administration When the Port Glasgow shipyard went into administration on 16 August the Scottish government agreed to take control of the facility under a management agreement with administrators. This deal means Scottish ministers will buy Ferguson Marine if no private buyer is found within four weeks of the date of the firm going into administration. The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard is being met from Scottish government funds and a new board has been put in place to come up with a plan to finish the delayed CalMac ferries. At the time of the administration being announced, Deloitte described the ferry contract as being ""materially behind schedule and over budget"". The GMB union's Scotland organiser Gary Cook said: ""This is a process which we are fully aware of but whether the long-term future of the yard is under nationalisation or new ownership, the challenges remain exactly the same. ""This is a viable yard with a first-class workforce but it requires a proper industrial plan to ensure its future prosperity. ""The Scottish government has recognised the workforce must be front and centre in the delivery of it because the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated. ""We are confident that with vision and competency the future of Ferguson Marine will be a bright one as we get on with the business of building the ships Scotland needs."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Ministers remain committed to the completion of vessels, securing jobs, and working towards finding a solution to support future shipbuilding at the site. ""Deloitte, as administrator, is currently going through the process of market testing for a private buyer. We will also start work to determine the optimal structure for the yard to ensure its long-term future. ""Our first priority is to establish a new delivery programme to ensure the completion of the CMAL ferry contracts."" Do you know this pooch?

Police said the 31-year-old was assaulted at a flat in Pollokshaws Road at about 01:15. It is being treated as attempted murder. Eyewitnesses heard the woman's husband screaming for help as he tried to get her to hospital. A neighbour tried to stem the bleeding, while another neighbour comforted the woman's six-year-daughter. An eyewitness told the BBC News website: ""A man ran down Pollokshaws Road shouting for an ambulance because someone had cut his wife's throat. Two neighbours came to his aid and called 999. ""The man went into a nearby flat and brought his wife out to a car - her neck and scarf were soaked in blood. ""One neighbour put pressure on the woman's neck while the other took the couple's young daughter back indoors away from the scene - the man and girl were obviously very distressed. ""The police and ambulance came and taped off the flat and car. They treated the woman while she sat in the car then took her away in an ambulance. It was awful to see, I've heard she's in critical condition and I just hope she and her family recover from this horrific trauma.""

Buyers express interest in nationalised shipyardAdministrators for the Ferguson shipyard have held talks with a number of potentially interested parties.Glasgow & West Scotland,"A number of potential private buyers have expressed an interest in the nationalised Ferguson shipyard. Administrators for the Port Glasgow yard have held talks with several potential buyers and said they were ""encouraged"" by the interest so far. The shipyard is operating under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy Ferguson if no private buyer comes forward. About 300 people work at the yard. Fergusonwent into administrationfollowing a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - which buys and leases CalMac ships on behalf of the Scottish government - over the construction of two Â£97m ferries. Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has said details of a ""robust delivery schedule"" for the CalMac ferries must be announced by the end of October. The Glen Sannox vessel has been awaiting completion at the yard since its launch The Scottish government has made two loans to Ferguson Marine, totalling Â£45m, and what happens to these remains unclear. A spokesman for joint administrator Deloitte, who refused to be drawn on how many interested parties the firm had spoken to, said it was working hard to determine if a commercially-viable solution for the yard could be identified. He added: ""The joint administrators are undertaking a sale process and are actively engaged in discussions with a number of potentially-interested parties, however it is early in the process and therefore it is not appropriate for us to comment further at this stage. ""We have been encouraged by the level of interest in the yard so far but would encourage any remaining parties who may have an interest to contact us."" An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a very public dispute which ended with Ferguson Marine going into administration When the Port Glasgow shipyard went into administration on 16 August the Scottish government agreed to take control of the facility under a management agreement with administrators. This deal means Scottish ministers will buy Ferguson Marine if no private buyer is found within four weeks of the date of the firm going into administration. The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard is being met from Scottish government funds and a new board has been put in place to come up with a plan to finish the delayed CalMac ferries. At the time of the administration being announced, Deloitte described the ferry contract as being ""materially behind schedule and over budget"". The GMB union's Scotland organiser Gary Cook said: ""This is a process which we are fully aware of but whether the long-term future of the yard is under nationalisation or new ownership, the challenges remain exactly the same. ""This is a viable yard with a first-class workforce but it requires a proper industrial plan to ensure its future prosperity. ""The Scottish government has recognised the workforce must be front and centre in the delivery of it because the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated. ""We are confident that with vision and competency the future of Ferguson Marine will be a bright one as we get on with the business of building the ships Scotland needs."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Ministers remain committed to the completion of vessels, securing jobs, and working towards finding a solution to support future shipbuilding at the site. ""Deloitte, as administrator, is currently going through the process of market testing for a private buyer. We will also start work to determine the optimal structure for the yard to ensure its long-term future. ""Our first priority is to establish a new delivery programme to ensure the completion of the CMAL ferry contracts."" Do you know this pooch?

Chancellor pledges Â£400m further education funding,"The chancellor said it was a further education college that equipped him ""with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions"" The chancellor is to announce Â£400m of additional funding for further education in England, as part of his spending review next week. Writing inthe Guardian,external, Sajid Javid said the money - for the year 2020 to 2021 - would support the introduction of the new T-level qualifications. He vowed to treat colleges ""with the seriousness they deserve"". It comes after the government announced billions of pounds in extra funding for England's schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the funding would help cover costs, including pensions, and would help young people ""get the skills to get the right jobs"". New T-level to be worth three A-levels T-levels are a new two-year qualification being introduced in England next September. They will give 16 to 19-year-olds a mix of classroom learning and ""on the job"" experience. The qualifications, in subjects including accountancy and catering, have been developed in collaboration with industry. The Â£400m sum will help fund new technical and vocational qualifications as well as ""more expensive"" courses such as science, engineering and mathematics, said Mr Javid. ""I want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education,"" he added. ""It was an FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions. ""We'll make a strong statement in backing it at next week's spending round and I'll continue to look at what more we can do to help, just as my FE college opened my horizons and set me on my way."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, welcomed Mr Javid's funding boost pledge. ""We hear a lot about schools. We hear a lot about universities but it's actually the further education sector which has had the biggest cuts since 2010,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Spending review game has changed but not the rules Further education 'funding crisis' fear However, the decision has been met with scepticism from Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. He said there are already qualifications in place - such as BTECs - that are costly and require funding. ""Unless this money is going in to help colleges with those young people, on those very expensive courses, then it will look like a missed opportunity,"" he said. Some cautioned that investment needed to be long term. Lowell Williams, chief executive of Dudley College, told the BBC: ""If it's just a one-off then, while it's most welcome, it won't have the impact that we need.""

Mum feared losing autistic daughter over rent debt,"There are about 3,000 people ""blacklisted"" from social housing in Wales because of old rent arrears, Shelter Cymru says A mother at risk of homelessness said she feared her autistic daughter would be taken into care when she was refused social housing because of rent arrears. Sarah Hillier, from Pontypool, said a Torfaen housing association had demanded immediate payment or she would not be considered for properties. The charity Shelter estimates there are 3,000 people ""blacklisted"" in Wales. A body representing Welsh housing associations said it was working with local authorities to address the issue. ""Former tenant arrears policies are trapping people in unaffordable housing and homelessness,"" said Jennie Bibbings, from Shelter Cymru. ""Nobody disputes that debts need to be repaid, but currently most landlords don't do enough to give people a second chance. ""For example, only a few landlords in Wales will agree to give people a new tenancy alongside an affordable repayment plan for the old arrears."" More than a million on social housing waiting lists Landlord 'evicted us after we complained' Housing 'crisis': Shelter Cymru urges investment Ms Bibbings said it was ""high time"" local authorities worked with social landlords to revise former arrears policies to take people's vulnerabilities and individual circumstances into account. Sarah Hiller, her partner Gavin and their daughter Michaela with their pet Jack Russell terriers Ariel and Fifi Sarah Hillier and her family - partner Gavin, their 15-year-old autistic daughter Michaela, and their two dogs Ariel and Fifi - are happy after finding a permanent home in Pontypool with Charter Housing Association. But they were facing the real prospect of seeing Michaela taken into care and their beloved Jack Russell terriers given away to a rescue centre. The family were issued with a section 21 - often known as a ""no-fault"" - eviction notice from a private landlord in February after she complained to environmental health officers about damp in the property. Gavin, who has lumbar spondylosis, a degenerative spinal condition, became ill from the damp and the council demanded the landlord take action. Ms Hillier immediately registered with the council's homelessness service and started applying for properties. Ms Hillier was told she needed to pay hundreds of pounds immediately or she would not be considered for a home In June Ms Hiller was told by Bron Afon Community Housing she would not be offered a home until she had cleared 60% of a Â£1,060 debt from a tenancy she had with the housing association between 2009 and 2011. ""I was really panicking at that point. I thought 'Oh my God, I'm not going to be able to get a roof over my family's head',"" she said. ""I had all that stress for eight months. I thought I was going to lose my child. She's autistic and we have two dogs which she's very attached to. It was very terrifying. ""I thought I had no-one to speak to. I was having chest pains and anxiety. It felt like I was hitting my head against a brick wall."" Ms Hillier spoke to staff at Shelter who helped negotiate a 50% reduction in the debt. She went on to find a home near family which has helped with care for her daughter and partner. A Bron Afon spokesman said: ""All landlords have a policy on previous rent arrears. Our policy is flexible and supportive as we understand the difficulties that people can find themselves in. ""We are confident that the support and advice we gave Ms Hillier went further than our policy to help her with her future housing options. ""During this time we liaised regularly with Shelter Cymru who were happy with our approach."" The Welsh Government says it is ""not acceptable"" for vulnerable people to be made homeless because of rent arrears ""We agree with Shelter that social housing should be open to all,"" said Stuart Ropke, chief executive of Community Housing Cymru (CHC), which represents housing associations in Wales. Mr Ropke said CHC was working with the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) to ""research the current effectiveness of housing waiting lists and identifying areas for change"", and called for more funding to tackle tenants' debt. The Welsh Government said the situation was ""not acceptable"", adding local authorities had a legal duty to ""help individuals in need to find a safe and secure home"". ""Preventing an individual with outstanding rent arrears would be acting inconsistently with this duty,"" a Welsh Government spokeswoman added. ""Local authorities should consider if the applicant can demonstrate efforts to pay their debts. Local authorities also have some discretion to use flexible prevention funds to help individuals or households to overcome housing debt."" Wales looks at thousands of new council homes by 2040 Shipping containers used to house homeless children Co-housing: Wales' first officer appointed in Powys The WLGA, which represents local authorities, supports ""sharing best practice"" to help people excluded from waiting lists because of past arrears. ""Absurdly"", Shelter said at least two authorities - Rhondda Cynon Taf and Wrexham councils - do not allow people on the social housing register if they have arrears from private tenancies. Rhondda Cynon Taf council said only people with arrears in excess of Â£744 are barred, and that it offers ""specialist support"" to those who are. Wrexham council said it does have an ""exclusions policy"", which is in line with Welsh Government guidance and is not a ""blanket policy"". Universal credit 'forces tenants into rent arrears' Homeless children housed in shipping containers No-fault eviction ban 'will hurt tenants' No-fault evictions to be banned 'More powers' for social housing tenants Welsh Government Shelter Cymru Wrexham County Borough Council Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council Bron Afon Community Housing Community Housing Cymru Welsh Local Government Association LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

India declares 1.9m 'illegal foreigners',"This video can not be played India says the process is needed to identify illegal migrants India has published the final version of a list which effectively strips about 1.9 million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. People left off the list will have 120 days to appeal against their exclusion. It is unclear what happens next. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. It has already detained thousands of people suspected of being foreigners in temporary camps which are housed in the state's prisons, but deportation is currently not an option for the country. The process has also sparked criticism of ""witch hunts"" against Assam's ethnic minorities. A draft version of the list published last year had four million people excluded. The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in Assam and is therefore Indian, and who might be a migrant from neighbouring Bangladesh. The register has been updated for the first time. The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in the state and is Indian Families in the state have been required to provide documentation to show their lineage, with those who cannot prove their citizenship deemed illegal foreigners. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long railed against illegal immigration in India but has made the NRC a priority in recent years. By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Assam A small community centre in the village of Katajhar is being guarded by two members of the Indian army. Outside, a line of people wait. Some are clutching plastic bags containing documents. As they enter one of two rooms, an official runs his eyes down a print-out to see if their names or photos are on it.  This list - the National Register of Citizens - is one with huge consequences. And so there's fear and trepidation as people here find out whether they've been included. Many here who haven't made it tell me it's a mistake as they show me paperwork they say proves they belong in this country. None of Asia Khatun's family of nine made the list. They now have the chance to appeal but there's real fear about what might come next. ""I'd rather die than go to a detention centre,"" she tells me. People here are angry but they're also scared. Assam is one India's most multi-ethnic states. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living there. Among its residents are Bengali and Assamese-speaking Hindus, as well as a medley of tribespeople. A third of the state's 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a 4,000-km long border with India, has been a concern there for decades now. The government said in 2016 that an estimated 20 million illegal immigrants were living in India. Not quite. Residents excluded from the list can appeal to the specially formed courts called Foreigners Tribunals, as well as the high court and Supreme Court. However, a potentially long and exhaustive appeals process will mean that India's already overburdened courts will be further clogged, and poor people left off the list will struggle to raise money to fight their cases. Saheb Ali, 55, from Goalpara district, has not been included in the list If people lose their appeals in higher courts, they could be detained indefinitely. Some 1,000 people declared as foreigners earlier are already lodged in six detention centres located in prisons. Mr Modi's  government is also building an exclusive detention centre, which can hold 3,000 detainees. ""People whose names are not on the final list are really anxious about what lies ahead. One of the reasons is that the Foreigners Tribunal does not have a good reputation, and many people are worried that they will have to go through this process,"" Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty, author of Assam: The Accord, The Discord, told the BBC. The special courts were first set up in 1964, and since then they have declared more than 100,000 people foreigners. They regularly identify ""doubtful voters"" or ""illegal infiltrators"" as foreigners to be deported. But the workings of the specially formedForeigners Tribunals,external, which have been hearing the contested cases, have been mired in controversy. There are more than 200 such courts in Assam today, and their numbers are expected to go up to 1,000 by October. The majority of these tribunals were set up after the BJP came to power in 2014. The courts have been accused of bias and their workings have often been opaque and riddled with inconsistencies. This video can not be played Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted For one thing, the burden of proof is on the accused or the alleged foreigner. For another, many families are unable to produce documents due to poor record-keeping, illiteracy or because they lack the money to file a legal claim. People have been declared foreigners by the courts because of differences in spellings of names or ages in voter rolls, and problems in getting identity documents certified by authorities. Amnesty International has described the work by the special courts as ""shoddy and lackadaisical"". Journalist Rohini Mohan analysed more than 500 judgements by these courts,externalin one district and found 82% of the people on trial had been declared foreigners. She also found more Muslims had been declared foreigners, and 78% of the orders were delivered without the accused being ever heard - the police said they were ""absconding"", but Mohan found many of them living in their villages and unaware they had been declared foreigners. ""The Foreigners Tribunal,"" she says, ""must be made more transparent and accountable."" A decorated Indian army veteran,Mohammed Sanaullah spent 11 days in a detention campin June after being declared a ""foreigner"", prompting national outrage. Both the citizen's register and the tribunals have also sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Many say the list has nothing to do with religion, but activists see it as targeting the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. They also point to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Bangladesh. The move to make millions of people stateless will probably spark protests However significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus have also been left off the citizenship list, underscoring the communal and ethnic tensions in the state ""One of the communities worst affected by the list are the Bengali Hindus. There are as many of them in detention camps as Muslims. This is also the reason just days before NRC is to be published the BJP has changed tack, from taking credit for it to calling it error-ridden. That is because the Bengali Hindus are a strong voter base of the BJP,"" says Barooah Pisharoty. Fearing possible loss of citizenship and detention after exclusion from the list,scores of Bengali Hindus and Muslims have killed themselvessince the process to update the citizen register started in 2015, activists say. And in an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. Detainees have complained of poor living conditions and overcrowding in the detention centres. A father and son killed themselves 30 years apart because of citizenship doubts (photo shows funeral) One detainee told a rights group after his release he had been taken to a room which had a capacity for 40 people, but was filled with around 120 people. People who have been declared foreigners as well as many inmateshave been suffering from depression,external. Children have also been detained with their parents. Human rights activist Harsh Mander, who visited two detention centres, has spoken about a situation of ""grave and extensive human distress and suffering"". The BJP which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Many believe that India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo that of the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. It is not clear whether the people stripped of their Indian citizenship will be able to access welfare or own property. One possibility is that once they are released, they will be given work permits with some basic rights, but will not be allowed to vote.

Sturgeon condemns 'sectarian' disorder in Glasgow,"This video can not be played Roads were blocked as a result of the demonstrations Nicola Sturgeon has condemned ""sectarian disruption"" at a march in Glasgow as ""utterly unacceptable"". Riot police, a helicopter and dog units were called in when an Irish Unity march in Govan was met by hundreds of ""disruptive"" counter demonstrators. Roads were blocked in what police described as ""significant disorder"" on Friday evening. Glasgow City Council said it planned to stop ""morons intent on bringing mayhem to the streets of our city"". Two men, aged 37 and 21, have been arrested and charged following the incident. Police Scotland has said it will undertake a ""thorough and robust"" review of the events. The Irish Unity march, led by the James Connolly Republican Flute Band, set off from Elder Park, Govan, at 18:30 but was soon met by a counter demonstration of ""several hundred people"" from loyalist groups. Govan Road was blocked by officers and the Govan subway station was closed for a short period. Witnesses reported the use of smoke bombs. Allow Twitter content?

Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, whose Glasgow Pollok constituency was where the march started, tweeted praise for the Police Scotland response and said it was ""utterly depressing to see this divisive thuggery on our streets"". Former first minister Lord McConnell called for more to de done at a national level to tackle sectarianism in Scotland. He tweeted: ""Enough is enough. Closing down the anti sectarianism summits after 2007 and ending the Scottish government-led drive for change in sport, marches, education and work was an act of political vandalism. ""We are reaping the consequences now. Time for action again. Warm words are not enough."" Ms Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf both welcomed a promised review by Glasgow City Council of its procedures on marches and parades. Glasgow City Council gave the march permission to go ahead on 22 August. Police Scotland's only condition was that the Sean McIlvenna Republican Flute Band did not take part due to the ""risk to public order"". Following the violence, the counciltweeted a statement,externalsaying:  ""The council is clear that the law expects it to facilitate public processions; including those that some people oppose or find offensive. ""However, this cannot continue to be at the expense of the overwhelming majority of Glaswegians, who want nothing to do with these marches, or counter-protests. ""The city needs and wants fewer marches. We are prepared to consider any action that will protect communities from morons intent on bringing mayhem to the streets of our city"". Ch Supt Mark Hargreaves said: ""Police Scotland has a duty to facilitate processions and any peaceful protest, but this kind of behaviour by persons demonstrating against the parade is utterly unacceptable. ""It is extremely disappointing to see people acting in this fashion, causing fear and alarm to members of the public as well as putting many people at risk.

Trial date set for 'architect of 9/11 attacks',"Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was first captured in Pakistan in 2003 A trial date has been set for Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks on the US. Mr Mohammad will be tried along with four other men at a military court in GuantÃ¡namo Bay from 11 January 2021. The men are charged with war crimes including terrorism and the murder of almost 3,000 people. The five men will be the first to go on trial, nearly 20 years since the devastating attacks on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. If found guilty, the group all face the death penalty. Mr Mohammad was captured in Pakistan in 2003, and transferred to America's GuantÃ¡namo base in Cuba where he was later charged. Profile: Al-Qaeda 'kingpin' But attempts to prosecute him and the rest of the group have been mired in delays. During an earlier attempt to try him before a military tribunal in 2008, he said he intended to plead guilty and would welcome martyrdom. In 2009 the Obama administration, which had pledged to close GuantÃ¡namo, tried to move the trial to New York but reversed its decision in 2011 after opposition from Congress. The five men were eventually charged in June 2011 with offences similar to those they were accused of by George W Bush's administration. The Pentagon has previously said Mr Mohammed admitted he was responsible ""from A to Z"" for the 11 September 2001 attacks. US prosecutors allege that he was involved with a host of other terrorist activities. The five men are being held at a US military base in Cuba, where they will also be tried These include the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia; the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl; and a failed 2001 attempt to blow up an airliner using a shoe bomb. Hearings for the forthcoming trial are planned for next month. Lawyers for the group are trying to bar the use of confessions the defendants made to the FBI in 2006. They argue that the confessions are unusable in court because of the harsh interrogations carried out during their detention. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has alleged he was repeatedly tortured during his detention in Cuba. CIA documents confirm he was subjected to simulated drowning, known as waterboarding, 183 times. The four other men - Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa al-Hawsawi - were also interrogated by the CIA in a network of overseas prisons, known as ""black sites"", before they were passed on to the US military. 9/11 accused in vacuum cleaner plea Chaotic start to 9/11 tribunal 9/11 suspects face fresh charges LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Boy, 15, fighting for life after stab attack","Police at the scene on Willan Road, in the Broadwater Farm estate Four people have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 15-year-old boy was stabbed. The victim is in a critical condition in hospital following the attack in Tottenham, north London, on Friday. He was found with multiple stab wounds on Willan Road, in the Broadwater Farm estate, at around 11:15 BST. The Met Police said two men in their 20s and a 17-year-old boy were all arrested on Friday on suspicion of attempted murder. Another man, aged in his 20s, was arrested on Saturday morning. All four remain in custody, the Met said. Officers believe the boy was involved in an altercation shortly before he was stabbed, possibly by someone riding a bicycle. Police would like to speak to members of the public who gave first aid to the boy at the scene. Det Insp Paul Ridley said: ""I am keen to hear from anyone who either witnessed, or has information concerning this attack. ""The victim, not yet 16 years old, sustained multiple stab wounds and is fighting for his life. ""If you know anything about the circumstances surrounding the incident or if you witnessed it, please do come forward.

"Did Trump tweet classified military imagery?The US president seemed to taunt Iran over a missile launch failure, but said the US was not involved.US & Canada","Donald Trump's latest tweet has potentially set a precedent for classified information being shared by a president President Donald Trump has set a new standard for extraordinary presidential behaviour. Not only has he tweeted what would normally be a highly classified, military-quality satellite image showing the devastation around the launch pad at Iran's main space centre following a significant explosion. He has gone further by apparently taunting the Iranians, insisting the US was not involved in the ""catastrophic accident"" but also wishing Iran ""good luck"" in finding out what happened. Was this presidential sarcasm or misinformation? Was he implying that somebody else might indeed have been involved? Or was it just the president's regular habit of responding by saying the first thing that came into his head? It's hard to say. But, as ever, Mr Trump's intervention raises more questions than it answers. For some weeks now experts have been reporting preparations for an Iranian space launch. Commercial satellite imagery of the space centre showed the launch pad being made ready. The mission, according to Iranian reports, was to put a small telecommunications satellite - Nahid 1 - into orbit. Two previous launch attempts at the start of this year had ended in failure. This one, too, appears now to have ended in disaster. The difference, though, is that the full magnitude of the calamity has been revealed by President Trump himself. So what caused Iran's rocket to explode so dramatically on the launchpad? We simply do not know. But there are two obvious answers. What would a US-Iran conflict look like? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Firstly it could have been down to a simple technical malfunction; a problem with fuel or some kind of error in the rocket's manufacture - a faulty weld seam or whatever. These things happen; think back to some of the disasters during America's own space programme. Even the most technologically advanced nations have setbacks. But Iran's track record with launches is very poor. A New York Times article back in February, drawing heavily on interviews with unnamed US officials, suggested that Iran's two earlier failures this year were part of a pattern. It suggested that some 67% of Iran's orbital launch attempts over the past 11 years had failed. It described this as ""an astonishingly high number"" compared to the average 5% failure rate for comparable launches worldwide."" Tensions have been escalating between the US and Iran The article indicated that the Trump administration was moving to reactivate a sabotage programme against Iran's missile efforts by introducing faulty parts into the supply chain and so on. A previous US effort had been phased out by President Obama. So could sabotage be implicated in this latest accident?  Who knows, but Mr Trump himself has only muddied the waters by his Twitter intervention. There is a significant history of external forces attempting to hamper Iran's military research. Israel and the US were involved in efforts to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme using a computer virus. Iranian scientists and technicians have been assassinated. US-Iran relations: a brief history And of course both the US and Israel see Iran's space programme as inextricably linked to its wider missile efforts. However, the most extraordinary aspect of this affair is the president's publication of a normally classified high-resolution satellite image that could only have come from a military source. This has thrown the missile and arms control community on the Twitter-sphere into a frenzy. It is an amazing thing for a US president to do, giving all Washington's enemies a very public insight into its extraordinary intelligence-gathering capabilities. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? What would a US-Iran conflict look like? Iran nuclear deal: What it all means Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead?

"Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing dies at 93The packaging giant's driving force will also be remembered for his philanthropy, his family says.","Hans Rausing, the Swedish billionaire who helped build food packaging company Tetra Pak into a global giant, has died aged 93. Son of its founder, Ruben Rausing, he ran the firm from 1950 until 1995 - when he sold his share in the family business to his brother. Mr Rausing was known for his philanthropy in Sweden and the UK. His family's fortune, estimated by Forbes at $12bn (Â£9.8bn), makes them one of the richest living in the UK. In recent years, Mr Rausing's family were hit by scandal, afterhis son was given a suspended prison sentence for failing to report the death of his wife. Hans Rausing's father, Ruben, founded Tetra Pak, later Tetra Laval, in Sweden in 1944. The company is widely praised for revolutionising the global food packing trade. The original design for its innovative cardboard packaging was a tetrahedron, giving the firm its name, but the company's fortunes only really took off in the late 1960s under the leadership of Hans and his brother Gad. Watch: How the Tetra Pak became a million dollar idea The invention of the now more common cube-shaped cartons and aseptic technology to preserve the contents helped Tetra Pak replace heavier, breakable glass bottles in a growing number of markets. In the 1980s the Rausing brothers moved to the UK in order to avoid the higher rate of tax in their home country and Hans Rausing shot to the top of the UK's rich list. After he left the family firm in 1995, Mr Rausing, who lived in Wadhurst, East Sussex, devoted part of his time to philanthropy. More than Â£1bn was given to causes including innovation and research in medicine, human rights, culture and the environment, his family said. In 2006 he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his philanthropic activities. His three children said in a joint statement: ""Our father was an extraordinary man, achieving so many things in his long and distinguished career as entrepreneur and industrialist, and then as a philanthropist supporting multiple charities and foundations. ""We are very proud of that, but most of all we will cherish our fond memories of him as a loving father and devoted family man."" His son, Hans Kristian Rausing, was sentenced in 2012 for delaying the lawful and decent burial of his wife. The charge came after police discovered the decomposing body ofEva Rausing, 48,at the couple's home in Belgravia, central London. Police found the mother-of-four, who had been dead for two months, under a pile of clothing and bin bags during a police search following Hans Kristian Rausing's arrest on suspicion of drugs possession. The couple had fought a public battle against drug addiction after meeting in a rehabilitation centre in the 1980s. Million dollar idea: The Tetra Pak.
