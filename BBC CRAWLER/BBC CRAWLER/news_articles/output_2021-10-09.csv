Remove court's oversight of NI Protocol - Frost,"Lord Frost will use a speech next week to reiterate that the UK wants the European Court of Justice (ECJ) removed from oversight of the NI Protocol. The EU will bring forward proposals on Wednesday for reforming the protocol. They will focus on easing practical problems, rather than changing oversight arrangements. But the Brexit minister will say: 'Without new arrangements in this area the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive"". The protocol is a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, agreed by the UK and EU in 2019. It avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? EU to table new proposals for NI Protocol This has caused practical difficulties for some businesses while unionists say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. The UK government also wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court. In a paper published in July, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ's role because of the ""very specific circumstances"" of the protocol negotiation. It now wants a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be ""managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration."" Lord Frost is the UK's Brexit minister The ECJ is the supreme interpreter of the rules of the single market. As the protocol works by keeping Northern Ireland in the single market for goods, the EU says removing the ECJ would simply unravel the protocol. Speaking last week, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: ""I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" if it was ""fixed"". Lord Frost is expected to address that issue when he makes a speech to diplomats in Portugal on Tuesday. He will say: ""The commission have been too quick to dismiss governance as a side issue. The reality is the opposite. ""The role of the ECJÂ  in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates."" When the EU publishes its proposals next week that is expected to lead to a new round of negotiations. Both sides have suggested there will beshort, intense talks processbeginning in late October or early November.

Covid coma cancer patient 'a cat with nine lives',"Mrs Luttrell was only able to see her husband via a video-link while he was being treated A cancer patient whose wife was told he might not wake from a coma he was put in while being treated for Covid-19 has been called ""a cat with nine lives"" by doctors after making a speedy recovery. Paul Luttrell, who has myeloma cancer, went to Bristol's Southmead Hospital on 27 July and was placed in a coma. His wife Dalma said she was ""very much prepared for the worst"", but the 52-year-old woke after 11 days and left hospital a month after arriving. She said it was ""unbelievable"". Mr Luttrell, from Frome, was sent to the hospital after nurses noticed he was ""very unwell"" and had to put him on oxygen whilst on a routine dialysis visit. ""They put me into an induced coma for 11 days and it took me a week to fully wake up,"" he said. ""When I did, I asked doctors to call Dalma. ""They couldn't believe it."" Mr Luttrell said he hoped his story will show that the dangers of Covid-19 still exist Mrs Luttrell said following conversations with her husband's doctors, she had ""very much prepared for the worst"". She also said the medical team had warned her that as he was in a coma, he would probably need a long recovery time if he survived. However, within two weeks ,she said she ""had a call from him"", adding: ""It was unbelievable."" Mr Luttrell, who had been double vaccinated, said though he had had lucid dreams whilst in the coma of ""terrible things"", after he woke, he could walk ""my stairs at home to go to dialysis"" within a week. He returned home on 26 August. ""My haematologist and doctors said I was a cat with nine lives,"" he said. However, he said he felt lucky to be alive and was worried that about ""people still not taking [coronavirus] seriously"". ""Get vaccinated,"" he said, adding: ""Covid is very real.""

James Bond actor gives fundraising dads Â£10k boost,"Mr Airey said he was happy the actor had allowed them to share details of his donation Film star Daniel Craig has donated Â£10,000 to three fathers who have set out on a 300-mile walk to raise funds for a suicide prevention charity after their daughters took their own lives. Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen's ""Three Dads Walking"" trek will see them walk between their homes in Cumbria, Greater Manchester and Norfolk. They are raising money for the Papyrus charity. They said the donation from the James Bond actor was ""amazing"". This video can not be played Three dads united by daughters' suicides take on challenge Mr Airey said he was happy that the actor had let them share the news of his generosity. ""Allowing us to shout about it is fantastic news, especially as he's just about the most famous film actor in the world at the moment, isn't he?"" he said. The trio, who set out earlier, will be walking about 20 miles a day between Mr Airey's home, near Cumbria, Mr Palmer's house in Sale, Greater Manchester, and Mr Owen's property in Shouldham, Norfolk. They expect to complete the challenge on 23 October. Mr Airey, whose 29-year-old daughter Sophie took her own life in 2018, said they had ""three different stories to tell, but each has the same tragic ending; the devastating loss of a daughter to suicide"". ""Daniel Craig has clearly been moved by the indescribable pain we and our families are suffering and wants to help us to bring something positive out of the utter devastation,"" he added. Mr Palmer, whose daughter Beth died in 2020, said being part of the challenge was ""not a club I want to belong to, but [it gives us] an opportunity to fight back and maybe make a difference. ""We hope that by linking our three homes and telling our three daughters' very different stories, we will put a spotlight on young mental health."" As well as fundraising, the trio want to raise awareness of the help and support available Mr Owen added that ""strongly"" believed that ""in a moment of darkness"", his 19-year-old daughter Emily ""made a wrong decision"" last year. ""Had she just taken time to think or to speak to someone, her decision and my family's lives would be on another path,"" he said. ""Instead, she decided she could no longer go on, leaving behind a devastating ripple effect on her family and friends.""

Energy price cap not fit for purpose - suppliers,"The energy price cap protecting households from sharp rises in gas prices is ""not fit for purpose"", suppliers have said. Natural gas prices are at record highs, which has led to some domestic energy firms failing as they are paying more for gas than they are able to charge. Suppliers have warned that consumers could face a ""huge cost"" from these firms going out of business. There are also calls for an energy price cap to help small businesses. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid pandemic. Domestic customers are partly protected from sharp rises by a price cap - which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard tariff - although energy regulator Ofgem has warned that households will seefurther ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Last month, nine energy companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, told the BBC that while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". ""Crazy, just crazy"" is how the nursery and soft play owner Gordon Foster describes the sharp rise in energy prices, shaking his head in dismay. Businesses typically fix their energy bills a few years in advance, known as ""hedging"". Mr Foster is one of the unlucky ones whose energy contract is up for renewal, and at the moment he's looking at paying eight times his current rate, taking up a contract that would tie him in for years. The alternative is paying sky high prices now without a contract, and keeping his fingers crossed that prices will stabilise. For him, as for others, this sudden jump in costs makes parts of the business unviable, and certainly means he has to put his prices up for his customers. While households might have an energy cap in place to protect them from such eye-watering spikes in global markets, we are all exposed to the impact of such costs for businesses. Ultimately they feed through to everyone. He said while the cap protected customers in the short term, he thought there was somewhere between Â£1bn and Â£3bn in costs which would be spread back across business and households as a result of failed suppliers. Derek Lickorish, chairman of Utilita Energy, which has more than 800,000 customers, said there was no doubt there would be a cost paid by consumers for failed firms. ""The government has to look at the means by which they can support not only energy suppliers, but also big industry,"" he said. Mr Lickorish said he would like to see the price cap reviewed four times a year, rather than the current two, and for a longer period of gas prices to be considered in setting it. Stephen Murray, head of energy, commercial and partners at Moneysupermarket.com, said that while the usual advice for consumers was to shop around, for now it was to stay put, with those on a fixed deal likely to be better off. The price cap provided ""some level of protection"", he said, but ""that comes at a cost and we've seen that through failed suppliers"". Business group the British Chambers of Commerce has called for a similar cap to be introduced for the energy bills of small and medium sized businesses - those with 250 employers or fewer. These firms mostly buy their energy several years in advance, so those whose contracts are due for renewal now are facing a ""difficult time"", it said. The group's co-executive director Claire Walker said the increasing pressure on these sized businesses was ""becoming dire"" and said that a price cap would give them the confidence to maintain normal business activities. Dave Dalton, chief executive of British Glass, said he thought a cap would help but was probably ""too little, too late"" and that an ""immediate intervention"" was needed. The government said it was in regular contact with business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of global prices. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met leaders from heavy industry on Friday amid warnings that some sectors could have to shut down, but they failed to find any solutions. Labour has accused the government of being in denial about gas prices, with wholesale prices rising 250% since January. A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action, and the Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms that use a lot of energy - said measures were needed ""right now"". The group's chair Dr Richard Leese said that energy-heavy industries were ""intrinsically linked"" and if some sectors were forced to shut down, it would have a knock-on impact. ""We've seen the curtailment in production in the steel and fertiliser sector - that's had a knock-on impact into the supply chains in the industrial supply chains and domestic supply chains,"" he said. UK Steel boss Gareth Stace said he was ""baffled"" that the UK government had failed to find solutions because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry - although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK.

Firms warn on costs,"High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Iceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". The warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year. They said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by Â£400 in the spring. Cornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about Â£1,660 by next summer. That is about 30% higher than the record Â£1,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October. ""With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,"" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight. Energy regulator Ofgem said the price cap ""will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter"". But if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said. The regulator said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"", but acknowledged ""this is a worrying time for many people"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in But while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. Mr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by Â£20m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises,"" he told the BBC. ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. ""Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Andrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: ""This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can."" One paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been ""left to fend for itself"" in the face of ""horrendous"" knock-on effects from the gas price rise. ""The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,"" said chairman Paul Fecher. Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production ""due to uneconomic higher energy costs"". This could cause ""severe damage"" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK. He said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Nine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate. They were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. Their customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered. Some of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe. UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention. But price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. The cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

'I haven't had any mental health care for 18 months',"This video can not be played Aimee says she has not had a face-to-face appointment in 18 months, despite being sectioned in 2019 ""I couldn't even take my children to school without a voice in my head."" Aimee, 29, from Bridgend, tried to take her own life after her mother's suicide in 2019, feeling it was a ""trigger"" for her mental health issues. She said because of the pandemic she has not had a face-to-face appointment in 18 months, despite being sectioned in 2019. The Welsh government said improving mental health is a priority, with an extra Â£42m spent this year. How has coronavirus affected mental health? Runner 'feels incredible' after hitting 189 peaks Facebook under fire over secret teen research The mother-of-two was diagnosed with complexpost-traumatic stress disorder,externaland emotionally unstablepersonality disorder,externaland said she been unable to access specialised help during the pandemic. She said: ""My mother, Louise, had suffered all of her life with mental health problems. ""I was experiencing the normal stages of grief, and we as a family were all in a great deal of shock - we were not expecting it. ""I had spoken to mum the night before and I thought she seemed OK and quite feisty which is what she was like. ""After the funeral I just couldn't eat, or sleep and it all took its toll on my body."" The treatment Aimee wants has a long waiting list and she said it could cost her thousands privately Aimee said even walking her children to school or making a cup of tea became difficult. ""I'd already previously suffered with my mental health. I started getting intrusive thoughts so I would have random things pop into my head. ""It was a constant battle against myself and it was exhausting. I had to try and act normal for my children, who had no idea what was going on but also fight against something which is still ongoing and how am I meant to fix it, without help?"" She said she felt services had been lacking during the pandemic and ""mental health has become a new virus in itself"". ""I have not had a single face-to-face appointment since moving back to Wales, so I haven't had any mental healthcare for 18 months. ""I've had no psychologist or psychiatrist appointments, all my treatment has been solely over the phone with a GP and the advice is just to double my medication."" Third of doctors seek pandemic mental health help Crisis concerns for young people's mental health Mental health sanctuaries urged for young Aimee wants to undergo eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), for which she said the waiting list was ""years long"". She said privately the sessions she looked at cost Â£500 each, with patients usually needing at least five, according to Aimee. ""I haven't got that kind of money and I can't access it,"" she said. ""I'm dosed up to the eyeballs on medication. And if I don't take it I get extremely poorly. I'm looking for different ways of managing my mental health but how can I get better if I can't get help?"" The Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said it could not comment on individual cases. A spokesman said: ""We encourage anyone who wishes to discuss a concern or complaint with us directly, and we will do our best to put it right. ""We continue to provide a comprehensive range of services for people with mental health issues, and we encourage anyone who may be needing support to get in touch with our teams."" Lockdown has increased mental health referrals, Mind Cymru says A recent report from the Samaritans found people who needed support during the pandemic had experienced reduced access to already-strained mental health services. Executive director in Wales Sarah Stone said: ""What we need is for people to have the services that suit them. So face to face is really important to people and tailored services. ""The pandemic has highlighted and increased inequalities in a range of ways so the work we have done has showed issues about mental health and well-being, fear of unemployment, financial struggles and also people struggling to find the basics of feeding themselves and their families."" Sunday marks World Mental Health Day 2021, with its main theme being mental health in an unequal world. A survey carried out by mental health charity Mind Cymru found people living in a household receiving benefits had seen their mental health hit hardest during the pandemic. Nearly six in 10 of the 650 people surveyed who lived in a household receiving benefits said they had poor or very poor mental health. That compares with 34% of those not receiving benefits. Head of policy Simon Jones said there was an urgent need to tackle inequalities brought into focus by the pandemic. He said: ""We know that mental health services were under huge pressure even before the pandemic. ""The impact will have a lasting effect on the mental health of many people in Wales, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that it has had, and continues to have, a disproportionate impact on certain groups of people - specifically people in poverty, and those from non-white communities."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Improving mental health and well-being is a priority for us and we are investing an additional Â£42m this year. ""Many people in crisis need a range of social and welfare support, as opposed to specialist mental healthcare and we continue to work on strengthening the multi-agency response. ""Our Discretionary Assistance Fund has been available to provide hardship payments and working in partnership with Citizens Advice to address underlying financial needs, including specialist debt advice. ""We have also expanded support for low-level mental health issues, like easy-to-access online cognitive behavioural therapy, which includes support for money worries.""

Clubs complain about Newcastle takeover,"This video can not be played 'It won't sink in for some time' - Football Focus discusses Newcastle takeover Top-flight clubs have complained to the Premier League after it cleared the Â£305m takeover of Newcastle by a Saudi Arabian-backed group. There is understood to be frustration from clubs about how the deal passed the owners' and directors' test. Concerns also arose as to why they were not kept informed after the surprise news emerged on Wednesday. Additionally, there are worries as to how Saudi Arabian owners will reflect on the league itself. There are many human rights issues linked to the kingdom. This video can not be played Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley speaks to BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan on day Saudi takeover was completed Clubs are demanding a meeting with the Premier League, which has previously said the takeover process would remain confidential. There is irritation with the Premier League board from all 19 other clubs, who are united in a view they should have been kept updated on an issue of such significance. The clubs also feel they should have been told what had changed to allow the deal to proceed before it was completed. When approving the takeover on Thursday, the Premier League said it has received legal assurances from the new owners that the Saudi state would not control Newcastle United and there would be punishments if it was proven otherwise. The takeover was 80% financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, whose chair is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Western intelligence agencies say he ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an allegation Bin Salman denies. Following Thursday's takeover, Amanda Staveley, Newcastle's director, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that PCP Capital took concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record ""very seriously"" but reiterated that their partner ""is not that Saudi state, it's PIF"". When asked if this was a case of 'sportswashing' by Saudi Arabia, she said: ""No, not at all, this is very much about the PIF's investment into a fantastic football team and we look forward to growing the club.""

"The UK is Europe's Covid hotspot - does it matter?Winter is approaching with infection levels higher than elsewhere, so is the UK in trouble?Health","With the news dominated by other issues, it has gone almost unnoticed that the UK now has one of the highest rates of Covid infection in Europe. But, as winter fast approaches, how worried should we be? The rates certainly look troubling. Only a handful of countries, including Romania and Serbia, have higher infection levels than the UK. And compared with the big nations in western Europe, the numbers are significantly higher. There is a variety of reasons for this. The UK - or rather England - was the first nation in Europe to fully unlock when it ended most Covid restrictions on 19 July. It was not until late August that an EU country - Denmark - followed suit. Others, such as Norway, have only taken this step in recent weeks, while many have retained a significant number of measures, such as limits on large gatherings, Covid passports to enter bars and restaurants, social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing. For example, in Germany and Italy there are still restrictions on large crowds at events like football matches. And in a number of nations, such as Spain, social distancing remains in schools as does wearing masks from the age of six. So it is hardly surprising a virus that thrives on human contact has taken off in the UK compared with the rest of Europe. Another factor is vaccination. At the start of the year and into the spring, the UK was leading the way on vaccination. But not any more, with the likes of Spain, Portugal and France all having administered more doses per head of population. A big reason for this is that many nations have started vaccinating under-16s, whereas this is only just getting going in the UK. But when it comes to protecting people from serious illness - older people and those with health conditions - the UK has similar high levels of vaccine uptake. And that protection means the gap in the numbers dying is much smaller. There are currently just over 100 deaths a day on average linked to Covid. That may sound a lot, but it is similar to what happens in a bad flu season for months on end. Of course, death should not be the only measure. Every day there are about 700 people being admitted into hospital with Covid. For some, the road to recovery will be long and arduous. There is also then the risk of ""long Covid"" among those who have not become severely ill. The idea of persistent symptoms after a viral infection is not unique to Covid - it also happens with flu. But given we are still learning about Covid and it appears to happen more often, there are some who argue this warrants more action to contain spread. Prof Christina Pagel and Prof Martin McKee, both of whom are members of Independent Sage, a self-appointed group of experts which has been critical of the approach taken by the government,wrote in the Guardian,externalthis week about the benefits of the ""vaccine-plus"" approaches taken on mainland Europe. But extra measures do come with a cost, so for others it comes back to trade-offs. Prof Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, believes there needs to be a debate about what is an ""acceptable"" level of Covid or we could find ourselves relying on extra measures long-term. ""Covid is here to stay - we need to discuss what we are willing to live with."" But it is not just where we are at, it's where we are heading that matters. There has always been variation in rates across Europe as a result of different approaches and being at different stages of the pandemic. The UK was hit by the more infectious variants Alpha and then Delta before other parts of Europe. Back in early spring, for example, the UK had one of the lowest rates in Europe because our Alpha wave had passed and Europe's was in full swing. With Covid the situation can change quickly. And as the chart on deaths above illustrates, this may already be happening. The UK death rate is falling - an achievement in itself given how open society is and a sign that the virus has been brought under some control. If nothing else really rapid surges in infection should be a thing of the past because of the amount of immunity in the population most experts agree. The epidemic here is largely being fuelled by high rates in teenagers - and, in particular, those under the age of 16 who have not had a chance to get vaccinated over the summer, unlike many of their peers elsewhere in Europe. Children are, of course, at very low risk of serious illness. So the concern has always been that infections in the young could spread into older age groups. But the early signs are that that is not happening - and the rise in children may have peaked. Prof Tildesley says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the data although he says it is quite possible rates in teenagers will remain high for a little while. When this wave in teenagers ends, through a combination of natural immunity and the vaccination programme that is clicking into gear, we could actually start to see a sustained fall in infections as winter approaches. That, after all, was always the argument the government and its senior scientists - Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - made when they decided to unlock on 19 July - that is was better to have our ""exit wave"" before winter really hit. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the senior scientists advising ministers, said this week there was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen next, but a sustained decline from this point on was possible. ""It's not guaranteed we will see a winter wave,"" he told MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. But the problem, he said, was there was ""limited headroom"" in the NHS to cope with even a little surge. And that is one of the big risks with the government's approach. The NHS has, compared with other nations, much less capacity to absorb extra demand. And this winter that will not just come from Covid. Lockdowns and social distancing meant the traditional winter viruses were largely absent last year. That will have led to less immunity across the population, prompting fears they could rebound back in a big way. A virus called RSV, which can cause 30,000 admissions every winter among the under-fives - six times what we have seen so far in that age group from Covid - is already circulating at very high levels. The flu season is just beginning. It will not take much for the situation to unravel.

James Bond actor gives fundraising dads Â£10k boostThree fathers doing a charity walk receive a donation from film star Daniel Craig as they set out.,"Mr Airey said he was happy the actor had allowed them to share details of his donation Film star Daniel Craig has donated Â£10,000 to three fathers who have set out on a 300-mile walk to raise funds for a suicide prevention charity after their daughters took their own lives. Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen's ""Three Dads Walking"" trek will see them walk between their homes in Cumbria, Greater Manchester and Norfolk. They are raising money for the Papyrus charity. They said the donation from the James Bond actor was ""amazing"". This video can not be played Three dads united by daughters' suicides take on challenge Mr Airey said he was happy that the actor had let them share the news of his generosity. ""Allowing us to shout about it is fantastic news, especially as he's just about the most famous film actor in the world at the moment, isn't he?"" he said. The trio, who set out earlier, will be walking about 20 miles a day between Mr Airey's home, near Cumbria, Mr Palmer's house in Sale, Greater Manchester, and Mr Owen's property in Shouldham, Norfolk. They expect to complete the challenge on 23 October. Mr Airey, whose 29-year-old daughter Sophie took her own life in 2018, said they had ""three different stories to tell, but each has the same tragic ending; the devastating loss of a daughter to suicide"". ""Daniel Craig has clearly been moved by the indescribable pain we and our families are suffering and wants to help us to bring something positive out of the utter devastation,"" he added. Mr Palmer, whose daughter Beth died in 2020, said being part of the challenge was ""not a club I want to belong to, but [it gives us] an opportunity to fight back and maybe make a difference. ""We hope that by linking our three homes and telling our three daughters' very different stories, we will put a spotlight on young mental health."" As well as fundraising, the trio want to raise awareness of the help and support available Mr Owen added that ""strongly"" believed that ""in a moment of darkness"", his 19-year-old daughter Emily ""made a wrong decision"" last year. ""Had she just taken time to think or to speak to someone, her decision and my family's lives would be on another path,"" he said. ""Instead, she decided she could no longer go on, leaving behind a devastating ripple effect on her family and friends.""

Zahawi vows to tackle pupil absences 'head on',"The education secretary has vowed to tackle persistent pupil absences ""head on"", describing it as a ""key priority"". In a speech to head teachers on Saturday, Nadhim Zahawi said disadvantaged children lose out most from not being in school. Ahead of the spending review later this month, he pledged to invest ""record sums"" in children's education. It comes after the number of pupils in England absent for Covid-related reasons rose two-thirds in a fortnight. The latest government figures showed204,000 children - 2.5% of state school pupils in England - were out of school for this reason in the fortnight to 30 September. There are also concerns children may be missing lessonsbecause of mental health issues. Are schools back to normal? Not quite Nadhim Zahawi: Iraqi refugee to education secretary Speaking at the conference of the NAHT school leaders' union in London, Mr Zahawi said: ""Another key priority for me will be getting to the root of what is causing children to be persistently absent and then tackling it head on. ""Because the children who lose out the most from not being in school are likely to be the ones who can cope least - the vulnerable, the disadvantaged. You can't help them if they aren't there. ""For all these reasons, we will continue to invest record sums in our children's education."" He added that he would not give a ""running commentary"" on the spending review, but said he would ""not stop"" making the case for investing in children and young people. He also called for better understanding of and support for mental health issues. ""I want us to put wellbeing at the centre of everything we do in schools alongside a drive for rigorous standards and high performance. But, of course, we can't do this if children are not at school,"" he added. In response to the education secretary's comments, Paul Whiteman, NAHT's general secretary, said Mr Zahawi needed to match the ""passion and ambition"" of school leaders. ""The real test though, is what he is prepared to do immediately, to prise more investment from the Treasury in the comprehensive spending review, and then how he chooses to develop policy in the coming weeks and months,"" he said. Addressing the conference on Friday, Mr Whiteman said the government's goals for helping children catch-up after the pandemic needed to be more ambitious. ""Recovery implies a return to what we had before, which is simply not good enough,"" he added. In June,the government's schools catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins resigned, saying the Â£1.4bn in funding pledged to help pupils make up for lost learning fell ""far short of what is needed"".

Berlin police probe Havana syndrome at US embassy,"Several people at the embassy have reported symptoms Police in Berlin say they are investigating after staff at the US embassy reported experiencing symptoms of the so-called Havana syndrome. The probe into an ""alleged sonic weapon attack on employees of the US Embassy"" began in August, police said. More than 200 US officials have reported suffering from the illness since 2016. On Friday President Biden vowed to find out ""the cause and who is responsible"" for the syndrome. Those affected say they experienced a sudden onset of pressure sensations inside their heads, and of hearing strange buzzing sounds coming from a particular direction. Others have complained of dizziness, nausea and fatigue, among other symptoms. âHavana syndromeâ and the mystery of the microwaves Several people at the US embassy in Berlin had reported symptoms of Havana syndrome, Der Spiegel reported. An embassy spokesperson declined to comment on the police inquiries, but told Reuters that a US investigation was ongoing into cases worldwide. Mr Biden's statement came as he signed a bill pledging better healthcare and increased financial support for victims. But he characterised the condition as ""anomalous health incidents"" rather than saying it was the result of attacks. He said civil servants, intelligence officers, diplomats, and military personnel all over the world had been affected. The mysterious illness first emerged at the US and Canadian embassies in Havana in 2016. Since then there have been a number of similar reports. Last month theCIA's station chief in Vienna was removedfor failing to respond appropriately to an outbreak of the mysterious syndrome at the embassy, where there have been more recorded cases than any other city apart from Havana. Days earlier a CIA officer who was travelling to India with the agency's directorreported symptoms consistent with Havana syndrome. And in August, Vice President Kamala Harris'flight from Singapore to the Vietnamese capital Hanoiwas briefly delayed after an American official reported symptoms. However, the cause of the illness remains unclear. Last year, a US National Academy of Sciences panel found that the most plausible explanation was""directed, pulsed radio frequency energy"".. And in 2018 a scientific study of diplomats affected in Cuba found that they had experienced a form of brain injury. The cause was not conclusively determined, but researchers said it was most likely the result of directed microwave radiation. In July, CIA director William Burns said there was ""a very strong possibility"" that the symptoms were being caused deliberately and that Russia could be responsible. However, Moscow has strongly denied responsibility. âHavana syndromeâ and the mystery of the microwaves CIA officer 'develops Havana syndrome' in India CIA 'removes Vienna boss' over Havana syndrome Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Why are bills rising?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too.

In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

MPs pressure government on fuel costs for industry,"The energy price cap protecting households from sharp rises in gas prices is ""not fit for purpose"", suppliers have said. Natural gas prices are at record highs, which has led to some domestic energy firms failing as they are paying more for gas than they are able to charge. Suppliers have warned that consumers could face a ""huge cost"" from these firms going out of business. There are also calls for an energy price cap to help small businesses. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid pandemic. Domestic customers are partly protected from sharp rises by a price cap - which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard tariff - although energy regulator Ofgem has warned that households will seefurther ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Last month, nine energy companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, told the BBC that while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". ""Crazy, just crazy"" is how the nursery and soft play owner Gordon Foster describes the sharp rise in energy prices, shaking his head in dismay. Businesses typically fix their energy bills a few years in advance, known as ""hedging"". Mr Foster is one of the unlucky ones whose energy contract is up for renewal, and at the moment he's looking at paying eight times his current rate, taking up a contract that would tie him in for years. The alternative is paying sky high prices now without a contract, and keeping his fingers crossed that prices will stabilise. For him, as for others, this sudden jump in costs makes parts of the business unviable, and certainly means he has to put his prices up for his customers. While households might have an energy cap in place to protect them from such eye-watering spikes in global markets, we are all exposed to the impact of such costs for businesses. Ultimately they feed through to everyone. He said while the cap protected customers in the short term, he thought there was somewhere between Â£1bn and Â£3bn in costs which would be spread back across business and households as a result of failed suppliers. Derek Lickorish, chairman of Utilita Energy, which has more than 800,000 customers, said there was no doubt there would be a cost paid by consumers for failed firms. ""The government has to look at the means by which they can support not only energy suppliers, but also big industry,"" he said. Mr Lickorish said he would like to see the price cap reviewed four times a year, rather than the current two, and for a longer period of gas prices to be considered in setting it. Stephen Murray, head of energy, commercial and partners at Moneysupermarket.com, said that while the usual advice for consumers was to shop around, for now it was to stay put, with those on a fixed deal likely to be better off. The price cap provided ""some level of protection"", he said, but ""that comes at a cost and we've seen that through failed suppliers"". Business group the British Chambers of Commerce has called for a similar cap to be introduced for the energy bills of small and medium sized businesses - those with 250 employers or fewer. These firms mostly buy their energy several years in advance, so those whose contracts are due for renewal now are facing a ""difficult time"", it said. The group's co-executive director Claire Walker said the increasing pressure on these sized businesses was ""becoming dire"" and said that a price cap would give them the confidence to maintain normal business activities. Dave Dalton, chief executive of British Glass, said he thought a cap would help but was probably ""too little, too late"" and that an ""immediate intervention"" was needed. The government said it was in regular contact with business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of global prices. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met leaders from heavy industry on Friday amid warnings that some sectors could have to shut down, but they failed to find any solutions. Labour has accused the government of being in denial about gas prices, with wholesale prices rising 250% since January. A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action, and the Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms that use a lot of energy - said measures were needed ""right now"". The group's chair Dr Richard Leese said that energy-heavy industries were ""intrinsically linked"" and if some sectors were forced to shut down, it would have a knock-on impact. ""We've seen the curtailment in production in the steel and fertiliser sector - that's had a knock-on impact into the supply chains in the industrial supply chains and domestic supply chains,"" he said. UK Steel boss Gareth Stace said he was ""baffled"" that the UK government had failed to find solutions because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry - although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK.
