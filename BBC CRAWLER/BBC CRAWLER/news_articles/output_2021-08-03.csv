Hiding student fell to death at lockdown party,"Tom Miller was a keen rugby player and charity ambassador A student fell to his death while hiding during a lockdown-defying party, an inquest has heard. Tom Miller, 24, went to the event in Tennyson Street, in the Radford area of Nottingham, on 5 December 2020. Nottingham Coroner's Court heard after midnight, council officers called on the house to warn them about noise. Rumours of arrests caused some people to hide, with Mr Miller getting on the roof and then soon after falling and suffering fatal injuries. The party took place while Nottingham was subject to tier three coronavirus restrictions, which banned different households mixing indoors. The court heard from PC Kate Gledhill of Nottinghamshire Police, who said the community protection officers gave a warning about noise and left. Mr Miller and a friend had filmed themselves sitting on the roof shortly before they fell Some partygoers claimed there had been a second visit but PC Gledhill said there was no record of this. But stories of a police presence caused a ""ripple effect"" with people going into bedrooms and the garden. PC Gledhill said: ""Tom travelled upstairs and found a small window which gave access to a ledge and then a section of roof. ""He filmed himself there and sent messages to friends, inviting one up to join him."" After spending a short time on the roof, his friend went to urinate but slipped. PC Gledhill said the pair became ""entangled"" and both fell. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Keen rugby player and Nottingham Trent University (NTU) student Mr Miller suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital the next day. The friend suffered less serious injuries. Recording a verdict of accidental death, assistant coroner Laurinda Bower said: ""This was a tragic case which led to the death of someone who was clearly highly regarded among his friends. ""It has had a profound and ongoing impact on those who were there and the wider university."" NTU Sport Head of Rugby Union, David Ross, said: ""Tom was an outstanding role model and leader within our rugby programme and will be sadly missed by his rugby brothers and the wider sporting community.""

Biden: Cuomo should resign over misconduct report,"President Joe Biden has called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after a damning independent inquiry found the New York governor had harassed multiple women. Mr Biden's condemnation of Mr Cuomo came hours after the state's Attorney General Letitia James said the governor had violated state and federal laws. In response, Mr Cuomo denied touching anyone inappropriately and vowed to stay in office. Mr Cuomo could now be impeached, and is also facing a separate criminal probe. ""I think he should resign,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. ""I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact. I have not read all that data."" The attorney general's investigation into her fellow Democrat was commissioned last year after several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the governor. Investigators spent five months speaking to nearly 200 people, including staff members and some of those who made complaints against him. Tens of thousands of documents, texts and pictures were reviewed as part of the inquiry. ""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,"" Ms James said. Mr Cuomo, she said, had engaged in ""unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments"". In one case, Mr Cuomo and his staff retaliated against a former employee who accused him of wrongdoing, according to Ms James. Other women described being groped, kissed or sitting on the governor's lap. Mr Cuomo allegedly reached under the blouse of an assistant to touch her breast, while another aide said he asked her if she was open to sex with an older man. Eleven women have accused Governor Cuomo of misconduct. Eight womensay he made offensive, condescending or sexual comments Seven womensay he inappropriately touched or groped them at least once Four womenallege he kissed them without consent The governor stood behind a state trooper in a lift, running his finger down her neck and saying ""hey you"", according to investigators. On top of the allegations of harassment, Mr Cuomo is accused of presiding over a ""hostile and toxic work environment"". Joon Kim, who co-led the investigation, said: ""It was a culture where you could not say no to the governor and if you upset him or his senior staff you'd be written off, cast aside or worse."" In his statement, Mr Cuomo said: ""I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances. This video can not be played Watch: The allegations and Cuomoâs âI kiss peopleâ defence ""I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am. And that's not who I have ever been."" New York's senators, the Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand used the release of the investigation to again call for him to resign. ""Today's report from the New York State attorney general substantiated and corroborated the allegations of the brave women who came forward to share their stories - and we commend the women for doing so,"" they said. The investigation is civil, rather than criminal, so will not directly lead to charges. But police could use the report in deciding to take further action and it is also likely to play a key part in a separate impeachment investigation he faces - as well as in a criminal inquiry in Albany, the state's capital city. After a whirlwind of attention earlier this year, the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations had been held at a low simmer for months. The New York attorney general's report now brings them roaring back. Cuomo was able to survive the story's first wave through a mix of denials, apologies and hunkering down in hopes that the political storm would pass. He seems determined to follow the same strategy again. Even with the new revelations and the report's conclusion that the governor engaged in a ""pattern"" of misconduct, an organised effort to remove Cuomo through legislative impeachment will be a tough task. Where this report may draw political blood, however, is by further diminishing Cuomo's prospects for re-election next year. His popularity has been dented, his opponents have multiplied, and the Democratic establishment continues to distance itself from the man who was once one of the party's top stars. On Tuesday afternoon President Joe Biden - who had withheld his judgement until now - added his voice to the chorus calling for Cuomo to resign. The governor seems determined to hang on and fight, but with few allies and fewer options, his fate is all but sealed. The allegations and Cuomoâs 'I kiss people' defence.

Gunmen attack home of Afghan defence minister,"This video can not be played Homes and cars were destroyed and streets left filled with debris An audacious attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul has left at least eight dead, the first major bombing by militants in the city for nearly a year. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi was not at home on Tuesday night as gunmen detonated a car bomb and fired shots near the heavily fortified Green Zone. His family was evacuated and four of the gunmen killed, officials said. The Taliban said they were behind the attack. The group also warned of more attacks against government leaders. It comes as fighting rages in other cities after foreign troops left the country. The UN Security Council has called for an immediate end to the violence. VOICES:Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans IN MAPS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan More than 20 other people were reportedly wounded in the incident. Police say four of the five attackers were also killed after they managed to enter the minister's villa. The interior ministry said it was a suicide bomb attack. Special forces rushed to the neighbourhood just outside the Green Zone, the heavily fortified enclave where many embassies and government buildings are located. A gun battle lasting more than three hours finally ended the assault. ""Do not worry, everything is fine!"" Mr Mohammadi tweeted after the attack. Afghan security forces sealed off the scene after the explosion and shooting on Tuesday night Hours later, crowds of Kabul residents took to the streets and rooftops to shout Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) in defiance of Taliban attacks, with videos shared on social media. Similar scenes had been recorded on Monday in the city of Herat, which has also seen heavy fighting in recent days. The public show of defiance is a key boost to the morale of embattled Afghan security forces, with the militants attempting to wrest control of a number of provincial capitals, the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Kabul says. But the attack on the minister's home shows how the insurgents can strike even at the very heart of the government, our correspondent adds. Fierce fighting between militants and government forces has continued in the city ofLashkar Gah,the capital of the southern Helmand province, with the UN saying on Tuesday that at least 40 civilians had been killed in the past day. ""There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" one resident, who is not being named for security reasons, told the BBC Afghan service in an interview on Whatsapp. ""Dozens of families have fled their homes and settled near the Helmand river."" Other terrified locals told the BBC they had seen bodies lying in the streets. This video can not be played General Sami Sadat: ""The battle is very intense in Lashkar Gah"" The Afghan army urged civilians to leave the city ahead of a major offensive against the Taliban, the hardline Islamist group that was driven from power by US-led forces 20 years ago. Fighting has been continuing in the city for days, with the militants now in control of almost all of its districts. The United Nations and other agencies are warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis. Capturing Lashkar Gah would be of huge symbolic value to the insurgents as they continue their rapid advance after the pullout of foreign forces. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign. EXPLAINER:Who are the Taliban? FEATURE:I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US At the weekend, Attaullah Afghan, the head of Helmand provincial council, admitted that fighting seemed to be ""getting out of our control"". The Taliban have made further advances this week, despite Afghan and US warplanes targeting the insurgents. Thousands of people in Helmand province have been displaced by fighting in recent months There are reports that Taliban fighters have taken positions inside homes, shops and the bazaar - people are trapped in their homes while fighting goes on in the streets. The militants generally warn people via loudspeaker to leave but sometimes they enter houses - locals have just minutes to flee or risk being caught in crossfire as their homes become part of the battlefield. Elsewhere in the south, Taliban are trying to captureKandahar, their former stronghold, and clashes have also intensified in the western city ofHerat.

Barbie doll of Oxford vaccine designer created,"Barbie maker Mattel has created a doll of the scientist who designed the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert. Dame Sarah said she found the creation ""very strange"" at first - but she hoped it would inspire children. ""My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist,"" she said. Her Barbie is one of six to honour women working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). The others include an Australian medic who helped create a reusable gown for health workers, and a Brazilian biomedical researcher. Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? Vaccinologist Dame Sarah - who was recognised with a damehood in the Queen's Birthday Honours - began designing a coronavirus vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China. Her vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - is now the most widely used around the world, with doses sent to more than 170 countries. ""I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of girls into Stem careers and hope that children who see my Barbie will realise how vital careers in science are to help the world around us,"" said Dame Sarah. In recent years, toymaker Mattel has responded to criticism that its Barbie doll sets an unrealistic image of womanhood. It now offers dolls themed around careers such as a firefighter, doctor and astronaut - and in a range of skin tones beyond its original white, blonde doll that first launched in 1959. Sales of Barbie dollsrose to a six-year high last year,as the pandemic saw parents stock up on toys for their children.

Johnson will not meet Sturgeon during Scotland trip,"Boris Johnson met Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in July 2019 Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""strange"" the PM would not meet her during his two-day visit to Scotland. The first minister said ""I don't feel snubbed"" but ""most people will think it's a bit odd"" that Mr Johnson declined an invitation. Instead, he has met police officers and visited a renewable energy project. Mr Johnson has suggested he have a meeting with first ministers at a later date. Nicola Sturgeon had invited the PM to her official residence to discuss Covid recovery. She said it was a ""missed opportunity"" that Mr Johnson did not meet her at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh. What happened to Indyref2? Gove 'can't see' Scottish referendum before 2024 In a letter to Ms Sturgeon seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson said he was ""keen to arrange an in-person meeting"" with her. He said that, at a previous meeting between them, it was agreed they should set up a ""structured forum for ongoing engagement"" - and officials had made good progress on this. ""There is much for us to discuss as all parts of the UK work together on our shared priority of recovering from the pandemic,"" he said. ""The UK government is working closely with the devolved Scottish government on a variety of different issues."" And he added: ""I look forward to meeting with you soon and working together in the interests of people in all parts of our country."" Ms Sturgeontweeted on Monday,externalthat she had invited the PM to Bute House. She said the prime minister's trip would be the first chance for the pair to meet in person for a while. The first minister said she believed people would find it ""a bit odd and a bit strange"" that Mr Johnson had chosen not to meet her. Speaking to broadcasters, she said she did not feel ""snubbed"", but that it would have been the first opportunity to sit down and have a ""face to face chat"", describing the move as  a ""missed opportunity - but that's on him"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also on a visit to Scotland, said he thought the prime minister should meet Ms Sturgeon. He said the two should be working together on ""the two most important things facing us"" - the pandemic and the climate emergency. He added: ""We shouldn't have an argument about when they're going to meet or where - they need to work together on this."" They may not be meeting in person, but that doesn't mean Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon can't engage in some political games. The first minister threw down a gauntlet very publicly when she posted her invitation to Mr Johnson on Twitter. It was a win-win proposition for Ms Sturgeon, presenting the prime minister with the choice of looking like a visiting dignitary from a foreign power - or a scaredy cat swerving the jeering crowds which turned out for his last visit to Bute House. Ultimately Mr Johnson has refused to take the bait, preferring to suggest a summit of leaders from around the UK - presumably where he can take the role of magnanimous host. For all the talk of grown-up dialogue there is plainly no love lost between the pair, who will no doubt trade rhetoric via the media rather than face-to-face. And with the constitutional question of Scottish independence still looming between them, the political power-plays are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The trip is Mr Johnson's first visit to Scotland since January - and his first since a pro-independence majority was returned at the Holyrood election in May. There is no prospect of the pair seeing eye-to-eye on another referendum, but Ms Sturgeon had said she wanted to discuss how the governments could work together on ""Covid recovery"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP leader had put out her invitation to the prime minister via Twitter, adding: ""I'm not sure if he got it before everyone else got it on Twitter"". Mr Ross said: ""His response was quite right. Nicola Sturgeon had agreed with the prime minister that governments across the UK would meet together. That is the right approach to take and that was the agreement made recently. ""There's constant dialogue between the Scottish and UK governments."" On the prime minister's last trip to Scotland in January, Ms Sturgeonquestioned whether the trip was essentialduring lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said it was important for the prime minister to be ""visible and accessible"" during the pandemic.

Most Covid rules to end in Scotland from 9 August,"Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Social distancing will be dropped in most settings, meaning more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts. And close contacts of those who test positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate - as long as they are fully vaccinated and test negative. However, the wearing of face coverings in some public spaces will continue. This will include secondary schools, where staff will need to maintain 1m physical distancing for the first six weeks of term and twice-weekly testing will be required. Full coverage of Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement Self-isolation of whole classes 'no longer routine' What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? The first minister also said a ""gradual approach"" will be taken to returning workers to offices, warning that the virus still poses ""real challenges"". While the changes would restore a ""substantial degree of normality"", she said they do not ""signal the end of the pandemic or a return to life exactly as we knew it"". She said: ""Declaring freedom from or victory over this virus is in my view premature."" The number of new Covid-19 cases has fallen markedly from the peak of the ""third wave"", with Ms Sturgeon saying the infection rate had fallen by two-thirds since early July. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement in a virtual statement to MSPs The percentage of tests coming back positive has also fallen, as has the number of patients being admitted to hospital and intensive care wards with the virus. The first minister said uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine had been ""exceptional"", and that this - along with the fall in cases - made it possible to lift most of the legal restrictions still in force. From Monday, 9 August, the current limits on the number of people who can meet up will be dropped, as will social distancing rules in most settings. This means nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and larger crowds will be allowed to gather for indoor and outdoor events - although organisers of large eventswill still need to apply to local councils for permission. The rules around self-isolation will also change, meaning that fully-vaccinated adults who are identified as a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to isolate if they return a negative PCR test. The use of face coverings will continue in secondary schools for the first part of the new term The government is still considering whether a certificate proving people have been vaccinated will be needed to enter ""higher-risk"" events. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that a ""Covid status certification"" app was under development, but said she was ""considering very carefully"" whether such a scheme would be appropriate. She also said she would not hesitate to take the ""tough decision"" to re-impose some local restrictions if there was a serious outbreak of the virus, saying the government ""will seek to take whatever action is necessary to keep the country safe"". While most restrictions will be lifted, a number of ""mitigations"" will remain in place, with Ms Sturgeon saying the harm of the virus ""cannot be underestimated"". The use of face coverings in enclosed spaces like shops, hospitality venues and public transport will remain ""for some time"" to come, and venues will still be expected to collect customer details for contact tracing. The first minister said it was ""vital"" that the return to working in offices was a gradual one, saying employers should consider a ""hybrid"" model of home and in-office work. Two weeks after restrictions were lifted in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. That's why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. The move was broadly welcomed by business groups, although some still voiced fears about the economic recovery. The Federation of Small Businesses said firms would be ""elated"" that the bulk of curbs were being lifted, but trading conditions had been ""permanently changed by the crisis"". CBI Scotland said moving beyond level zero ""creates a much-needed platform for kickstarting Scotland's economic recovery"", but said firms would be ""confused"" about why ministers were still advising people to work from home. And the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said hundreds of pubs would now reopen for the first time, hailing this as ""fantastic news"" - adding that it was ""vital that we get the recovery phase right"". The changes will allow hospitality venues to increase capacity The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer recess for the announcement, giving opposition leaders the chance to question the first minister on the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the statement was a ""mixed bag"", saying that ""ongoing restrictions will hold Scotland's recovery back"". He said: ""We have moved beyond level zero - but still curbs remain in place. Yet again the goalposts have been moved. We are at level minus one or minus two, and still the government is clinging on to parts of people's lives."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there was ""definitely light at the end of the tunnel"", but said ""we are at a crucial point for Scotland's recovery"". He called for a ""new approach"" in the fight against the pandemic, calling for increased support for the test and trace system and pop-up vaccination clinics at sporting events and universities.

"Clubs to host 5,000 without permission","Clubs will be able to host 5,000 fans without prior permission from Monday Scottish stadiums can welcome at least 5,000 fans from 9 August, but clubs must still apply to their local authority if they want to host more. First minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the limit for outdoor events has risen from 2,000, as part of a lifting of Coronavirus rules. Some clubs have hosted more than 5,000 spectators since 19 July after gaining approval from their local councils. And Ms Sturgeon said the application process for bigger events will remain. The first minister said the move would give the Scottish Government reassurance that events are being carried out safely and the application process will only remain ""for a limited period"". The Scottish government is also considering bringing in so-called vaccine passports for access to certain higher risks events. However, the first minister added they do not underestimate the ""ethical, equity, and human rights issues"" associated with checks, and said their use would be limited. Since 19 July, clubs have been applying to their local council to host more than the legal limit, which will be 5,000 from Monday. They have to submit an operations and risk assessment to prove they are keeping spectators safe. Clubs have to prove they have considered the potential impact on the local area in terms of a Covid-19 outbreak, as well as pressures on public transport and businesses, and whether lots of people are likely to be travelling from elsewhere in the country to the event. Crucially, previous evidence of safely hosting an event counts in favour of applicants, and so clubs who have already had applications approved are likely to be in a strong position.

Ship hijacked by armed men off UAE,"The MV Asphalt Princess was reportedly boarded by up to nine armed men A Panama-flagged ship has been hijacked by armed men in the Gulf of Oman and ordered to sail to Iran, Lloyds List Maritime Intelligence has confirmed. The bitumen tanker MV Asphalt Princess is heading into the congested approach to the Strait of Hormuz, it said. It is not clear who has seized the ship but analysts say Iranian forces will be suspected. Iran's Revolutionary Guards dismissed the reports as a pretext for ""hostile action"" against Tehran. The incident comes less than a week after an oil tanker operated by an Israeli-owned company was attacked by a drone off Oman, killing two security guards - one British and the other Romanian. The US, UK and Israel blamed Iran for the attack - a claim it strongly denies. BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says the MV Asphalt Princess is owned by a Dubai-based company that had one of its ships hijacked two years ago by revolutionary guards. He says that, according to reports, up to nine armed men boarded the MV Asphalt Princess as it neared the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world's maritime oil supplies passes. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) advised shipping near Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman to exercise extreme caution. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said it was urgently investigating reports of an incident on a vessel off the UAE coast. The White House called the reports ""deeply disturbing"". UKMTO had initially warned ships of an incident before declaring a ""potential hijack"" hours later. Earlier in the day, four oil tankers reported that they were ""not under command"", which usually means that a vessel has lost power and cannot steer. One of the ships later began moving, AP news agency reports. An Oman Air Force marine patrol aircraft was seen flying over the sea at the same time, according to data from FlightRadar24.com. Iran's foreign ministry said reports involving several ships on Tuesday were ""suspicious"" and warned against any effort to ""create a false atmosphere"" against Tehran.

Seven guilty of student's drive-by shooting murder,"Aya Hachem was walking to the supermarket to buy food for her family when she was shot Seven men have been found guilty of murdering a student who was shot dead in a feud between two tyre firm owners. Aya Hachem, 19, was mistakenly killed in the botched drive-by shooting in Blackburn on 17 May last year. Tyre firm boss Feroz Suleman, 40, had arranged the execution of a rival businessman but the gunman he hired shot dead Ms Hachem instead. Seven of the eight people who were on trial at Preston Crown Court were convicted of Ms Hachem's murder. Suleman along with accomplices Kashif Manzoor, 26, Ayaz Hussain, 35, Abubakr Satia, 32, all of Blackburn; Zamir Raja, 33, of Stretford; Anthony Ennis, 31, of Partington, and Uthman Satia, 29, of Great Harwood, will be sentenced on Thursday. The eighth defendant, Judy Chapman, 26, of Great Harwood, was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and will be sentenced on 1 October. Top row L-R: Abubakr Satia, Anthony Ennis, Ayaz Hussain, Feroz Suleman. Bottom row L-R: Kashif Manzoor, Uthman Satia, Zamir Raja and Judy Chapman Ms Hachem was shot as she was walking to the supermarket to buy food for her family to eat when they broke their Ramadan fast. The Salford University student was said to be ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" as the long-running feud between the neighbouring companies culminated in the shooting. Following the verdicts, Ms Hachem's family said she would ""remain in our hearts forever"". ""We are so proud of you and we miss you so much, our lives are difficult without you,"" they added. ""You loved life and despite all the struggles and barriers that we faced in this country, it did not stop you contributing to your community and charities including the Children's Society and fundraising at Salford University where you were studying to become a barrister."" This video can not be played Samar Salame said she was ""so proud"" of her daughter and she would ""remain in our hearts forever"" The court heard how a Toyota Avensis driven by Ennis with hitman Raja on board drove past Quickshine Tyres on three occasions shortly before the fatal fourth journey. Footage from CCTV cameras captured Suleman stood outside his premises next door at RI Tyres with a ""ringside seat"" to the shooting he had arranged of rival Pachah Khan, the proprietor of Quickshine Tyres. The first shot hit the front window of Quickshine and the second was let off as Lebanese-born Ms Hachem walked by, hitting her rather than the intended target. The student passer-by caught up in a fatal feud Businessman 'was target' of shot that killed woman Tyre firm boss 'had ringside seat' as student shot The jury was told aÂ feud had started in early 2019 when Quickshine, which previously only washed cars, began selling tyres next door to RI Tyres. Matters deteriorated on 3 December that year when someone set fire to RI Tyres in the early hours of the morning. On 1 May last year, Suleman called police and reported that Mr Khan had prevented workmen from entering Quickshine's yard to finish putting up a new sign for RI Tyres, the court was told. CCTV footage showed a gun being pointed out of the back window of the Toyota Avensis Jurors took less than four hours to find the seven men guilty of murder and the attempted murder of Mr Khan. Alan Richardson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Each of these callous conspirators is in their way responsible for the senseless killing of Aya Hachem - an innocent young woman full of promise who lost her life as a result of a petty business rivalry. ""The ruthlessness of everyone involved is staggering, with the group going to extreme lengths to plan an assassination in broad daylight, risking the lives of members of the public going about their daily business."" In 2001, Suleman was convicted of causing the death of a 67-year-old man by dangerous driving. He ran away from the scene of the incident in Blackburn and claimed his vehicle had been stolen before he finally pleaded guilty to the offence on the day of his trial and was jailed for three and a half years.

Scotland's growing sewage spill problem,"The number of recorded sewage spills in Scotland's rivers and seas has increased by 40% over the last five years, new figures show. Scottish Water data shows the equivalent of 47,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of waste has been discharged since 2016. Campaigners are calling for more action to tackle the water waste issue. But Scottish Water has warned the problem will not be solved by ""building bigger and bigger sewers"". When there is heavy rain parts of the sewer network simply cannot cope. Sewage waste gathered at an overflow pipe that leads to the River Almond in West Lothian To stop sewage backing up into homes, the storm water and waste that would ordinarily go to Scottish Water treatment centres is released into seas or rivers through the 3,697 Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) dotted across the country. Many of these overflow pipes are close to popular beaches and wildlife habitats. But Scottish Water is only required to monitor less than 3% of these CSOs for pollution, so the true scale of how much water waste is discharged is unknown. The figures the utility firm does have show that last year there were a total of 12,725 ""spill events"" - up 40% on 2016. A breakdown of these recorded overspill events in Scottish Water's network, released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws, has been fed into thisinteractive dashboard,external. The dashboard also allows people to view a list of the number of spills, how long they lasted and how much was discharged by the part of the sewer network that is local to them. However, the actual volume of spills is likely to be far higher. This is because the list represents a fraction of the operating CSOs and there is no volume data provided in the FOI response for just over half of the spill events. The data also doesn't indicate which bodies of water are being polluted by each spill. The volume of recorded spills has also soared in the last five years, up from 12.9m cubic metres in 2016 to 48m cubic metres last year. A total of 119m cubic metres of waste water were discharged in the recorded overflow events during this period. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Sewer overflows seem to have been baked into the industry's thinking. ""Rather than being 'emergency release valves' during exceptional storms, they are potentially used as a means of almost continuous sewage discharge. ""The defunding of regulators, self-reporting of incidents, and loose and vague targets has led to the decimation of rivers and the renewed sewage struggle on our coastline. ""The time for tough new legislation and binding targets to end sewage pollution has come."" A total of 654 CSOs which do not have adequate screening to retain sewage debris are classified as unsatisfactory by Scottish Water. Some 192 of them have been in this state since before the creation of the publicly-owned firm in 2003. The most spills at a single location were in Helensburgh, which discharges into the Firth of Clyde. There have been an average of two spills a day over the last four years. The location with the highest recorded volume of spills was Shieldhall in Glasgow, with 17.7m cubic metres of waste water released there since 2016. Scottish Water has estimated that to upgrade all of these unsatisfactory overflow outlets would cost at least Â£650m. A couple stuck at a bus stop in Edinburgh during a July storm when parts of the city's sewer network were unable to cope with the rainfall Simon Parsons, a director with Scottish Water, said CSOs ""remain a vital relief mechanism to safely relieve the pressure on the sewer network"". He said the utility firm invests heavily in its 31,000 miles of waste water networks every year. But he added: ""It's not about building bigger and bigger sewers, that is not going to solve the problem."" Citing theimpact of climate change on the intensity of rainfall in Scotland, he continued: ""We have to stop that surface water getting into our systems. ""Last year was a wetter year than many we have had on record and it's not just the wetness over the year, it is the intensity of the storms that are coming into our sewers which is driving those spills that we are seeing."" Mr Parsons pointed out that people flushing items like wipes down toilets was still a major cause of many of the blockages that can lead to sewage spills. This video can not be played âThereâs raw sewage going into the riverâ - campaigners want action to tackle overspills When about half of the average July rainfall fell over West Lothian in the space of a few hours, the River Almond Action Group (RAAG) knew what was coming next. Campaigners are all too familiar with what comes out of the CSOs that discharge into the waterway after heavy rain. ""At the outlet there is raw sewage coming into the river,"" explains Ruth Plevin a member of RAAG. ""Everything you can imagine; plastic, tooth picks, toilet paper, wet wipes, all stuck on trees and looking like toilet tinsel. ""But we don't know what exactly is in the water because they don't tell us. ""On sunny days, the river is so appealing and people want to go in - why shouldn't they? Instead they are exposed to what is effectively an open sewer."" A section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park which is hoped will become designated bathing waters Veolia, which runs the East Calder wastewater treatment works under a PFI deal with Scottish Water, recently organised a clean-up that saw 65 bags of sewage debris removed from the river. But locals are pressing for a permanent solution for a river which had an average of 1.3 sewage discharges every day in 2019. The Forth Rivers Trust charity has applied for a section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park to become designated bathing waters. If successful it would be the first river in Scotland to join the 85 beaches with the same status, meaning stricter limits on sewage overspills and up-to-date water quality information available to the public. Huw Streater, of the Forth Rivers Trust, said: ""The Almond has suffered from serious pollution issues for a long time. ""Achieving bathing water status will help to make the Almond safer for the people who use it and the wildlife that we share it with. "" In the East Lothian village of Aberlady, resident Frank Neate has been recording evidence of what he says is waste water and sewage debris being discharged from CSOs into the village's bay during dry weather. Aberlady bay was the UK's first nature reserve and Frank is worried about the impact of the waste on its wildlife. Frank Neate, who used to work in the water industry, has been keeping track of the CSOs in the bay of the East Lothian village of Aberlady He said: ""I've told both Scottish Water and Sepa this shouldn't be happening during dry weather but nobody seems interested. ""What worries me is there are kids and dogs in and out of here and people don't know what's in the water - and this in a nature reserve of all places."" The job of ensuring Scottish Water complies with the laws and standards around the sewer network and overspills falls to environment agency Sepa. Prosecutions over sewage spills in Scotland are not common but Scottish Water was fined Â£19,000 last year forreleasing untreated sewage into the River Clyde in Glasgowin 2016.. Sepa says it focuses its enforcement effort on prosecutions relating to more systemic issues and ""significant progress"" has been made in raising standards over the past 20 years ""through targeted regulation and partnership work"". When raw sewage escaped into the River Clyde in 2016 after a pumping station failure, the smell was so bad locals were unable to open windows and had to wash soft furnishings to get rid of the odour But Sepa figures show that in 2018 only 111 of the 345 Scottish Water sewer licences, which set the overflow conditions, were assessed for compliance. Ten of the 111 licences inspected were found to be unsatisfactory, with the rest compliant. The licences do not require permanent spill monitors to be installed on all of the CSOs. A Sepa spokesman said: ""We assess sewer network licenses on a rolling basis, with particular focus on those which have unsatisfactory compliance, as these can discharge sewage litter and impact on people's enjoyment of the environment."" The spokesman said an increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall meant there ""is a risk that the number of unsatisfactory sewer overflows may progressively increase"". And he added that a ""radical new approach to managing rainfall"" was needed to reduce flood risk and minimise sewer overflow spills.

PM will not meet Sturgeon during trip to Scotland,"Boris Johnson met Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in July 2019 Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""strange"" the PM would not meet her during his two-day visit to Scotland. The first minister said ""I don't feel snubbed"" but ""most people will think it's a bit odd"" that Mr Johnson declined an invitation. Instead, he has met police officers and visited a renewable energy project. Mr Johnson has suggested he have a meeting with first ministers at a later date. Nicola Sturgeon had invited the PM to her official residence to discuss Covid recovery. She said it was a ""missed opportunity"" that Mr Johnson did not meet her at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh. What happened to Indyref2? Gove 'can't see' Scottish referendum before 2024 In a letter to Ms Sturgeon seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson said he was ""keen to arrange an in-person meeting"" with her. He said that, at a previous meeting between them, it was agreed they should set up a ""structured forum for ongoing engagement"" - and officials had made good progress on this. ""There is much for us to discuss as all parts of the UK work together on our shared priority of recovering from the pandemic,"" he said. ""The UK government is working closely with the devolved Scottish government on a variety of different issues."" And he added: ""I look forward to meeting with you soon and working together in the interests of people in all parts of our country."" Ms Sturgeontweeted on Monday,externalthat she had invited the PM to Bute House. She said the prime minister's trip would be the first chance for the pair to meet in person for a while. The first minister said she believed people would find it ""a bit odd and a bit strange"" that Mr Johnson had chosen not to meet her. Speaking to broadcasters, she said she did not feel ""snubbed"", but that it would have been the first opportunity to sit down and have a ""face to face chat"", describing the move as  a ""missed opportunity - but that's on him"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also on a visit to Scotland, said he thought the prime minister should meet Ms Sturgeon. He said the two should be working together on ""the two most important things facing us"" - the pandemic and the climate emergency. He added: ""We shouldn't have an argument about when they're going to meet or where - they need to work together on this."" They may not be meeting in person, but that doesn't mean Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon can't engage in some political games. The first minister threw down a gauntlet very publicly when she posted her invitation to Mr Johnson on Twitter. It was a win-win proposition for Ms Sturgeon, presenting the prime minister with the choice of looking like a visiting dignitary from a foreign power - or a scaredy cat swerving the jeering crowds which turned out for his last visit to Bute House. Ultimately Mr Johnson has refused to take the bait, preferring to suggest a summit of leaders from around the UK - presumably where he can take the role of magnanimous host. For all the talk of grown-up dialogue there is plainly no love lost between the pair, who will no doubt trade rhetoric via the media rather than face-to-face. And with the constitutional question of Scottish independence still looming between them, the political power-plays are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The trip is Mr Johnson's first visit to Scotland since January - and his first since a pro-independence majority was returned at the Holyrood election in May. There is no prospect of the pair seeing eye-to-eye on another referendum, but Ms Sturgeon had said she wanted to discuss how the governments could work together on ""Covid recovery"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP leader had put out her invitation to the prime minister via Twitter, adding: ""I'm not sure if he got it before everyone else got it on Twitter"". Mr Ross said: ""His response was quite right. Nicola Sturgeon had agreed with the prime minister that governments across the UK would meet together. That is the right approach to take and that was the agreement made recently. ""There's constant dialogue between the Scottish and UK governments."" On the prime minister's last trip to Scotland in January, Ms Sturgeonquestioned whether the trip was essentialduring lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said it was important for the prime minister to be ""visible and accessible"" during the pandemic.

Seven men guilty of drive-by shooting murder,"Aya Hachem was walking to the supermarket to buy food for her family when she was shot Seven men have been found guilty of murdering a student who was shot dead in a feud between two tyre firm owners. Aya Hachem, 19, was mistakenly killed in the botched drive-by shooting in Blackburn on 17 May last year. Tyre firm boss Feroz Suleman, 40, had arranged the execution of a rival businessman but the gunman he hired shot dead Ms Hachem instead. Seven of the eight people who were on trial at Preston Crown Court were convicted of Ms Hachem's murder. Suleman along with accomplices Kashif Manzoor, 26, Ayaz Hussain, 35, Abubakr Satia, 32, all of Blackburn; Zamir Raja, 33, of Stretford; Anthony Ennis, 31, of Partington, and Uthman Satia, 29, of Great Harwood, will be sentenced on Thursday. The eighth defendant, Judy Chapman, 26, of Great Harwood, was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and will be sentenced on 1 October. Top row L-R: Abubakr Satia, Anthony Ennis, Ayaz Hussain, Feroz Suleman. Bottom row L-R: Kashif Manzoor, Uthman Satia, Zamir Raja and Judy Chapman Ms Hachem was shot as she was walking to the supermarket to buy food for her family to eat when they broke their Ramadan fast. The Salford University student was said to be ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" as the long-running feud between the neighbouring companies culminated in the shooting. Following the verdicts, Ms Hachem's family said she would ""remain in our hearts forever"". ""We are so proud of you and we miss you so much, our lives are difficult without you,"" they added. ""You loved life and despite all the struggles and barriers that we faced in this country, it did not stop you contributing to your community and charities including the Children's Society and fundraising at Salford University where you were studying to become a barrister."" This video can not be played Samar Salame said she was ""so proud"" of her daughter and she would ""remain in our hearts forever"" The court heard how a Toyota Avensis driven by Ennis with hitman Raja on board drove past Quickshine Tyres on three occasions shortly before the fatal fourth journey. Footage from CCTV cameras captured Suleman stood outside his premises next door at RI Tyres with a ""ringside seat"" to the shooting he had arranged of rival Pachah Khan, the proprietor of Quickshine Tyres. The first shot hit the front window of Quickshine and the second was let off as Lebanese-born Ms Hachem walked by, hitting her rather than the intended target. The student passer-by caught up in a fatal feud Businessman 'was target' of shot that killed woman Tyre firm boss 'had ringside seat' as student shot The jury was told aÂ feud had started in early 2019 when Quickshine, which previously only washed cars, began selling tyres next door to RI Tyres. Matters deteriorated on 3 December that year when someone set fire to RI Tyres in the early hours of the morning. On 1 May last year, Suleman called police and reported that Mr Khan had prevented workmen from entering Quickshine's yard to finish putting up a new sign for RI Tyres, the court was told. CCTV footage showed a gun being pointed out of the back window of the Toyota Avensis Jurors took less than four hours to find the seven men guilty of murder and the attempted murder of Mr Khan. Alan Richardson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Each of these callous conspirators is in their way responsible for the senseless killing of Aya Hachem - an innocent young woman full of promise who lost her life as a result of a petty business rivalry. ""The ruthlessness of everyone involved is staggering, with the group going to extreme lengths to plan an assassination in broad daylight, risking the lives of members of the public going about their daily business."" In 2001, Suleman was convicted of causing the death of a 67-year-old man by dangerous driving. He ran away from the scene of the incident in Blackburn and claimed his vehicle had been stolen before he finally pleaded guilty to the offence on the day of his trial and was jailed for three and a half years.

NY's Cuomo 'sexually harassed multiple women',"President Joe Biden has called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after a damning independent inquiry found the New York governor had harassed multiple women. Mr Biden's condemnation of Mr Cuomo came hours after the state's Attorney General Letitia James said the governor had violated state and federal laws. In response, Mr Cuomo denied touching anyone inappropriately and vowed to stay in office. Mr Cuomo could now be impeached, and is also facing a separate criminal probe. ""I think he should resign,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. ""I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact. I have not read all that data."" The attorney general's investigation into her fellow Democrat was commissioned last year after several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the governor. Investigators spent five months speaking to nearly 200 people, including staff members and some of those who made complaints against him. Tens of thousands of documents, texts and pictures were reviewed as part of the inquiry. ""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,"" Ms James said. Mr Cuomo, she said, had engaged in ""unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments"". In one case, Mr Cuomo and his staff retaliated against a former employee who accused him of wrongdoing, according to Ms James. Other women described being groped, kissed or sitting on the governor's lap. Mr Cuomo allegedly reached under the blouse of an assistant to touch her breast, while another aide said he asked her if she was open to sex with an older man. Eleven women have accused Governor Cuomo of misconduct. Eight womensay he made offensive, condescending or sexual comments Seven womensay he inappropriately touched or groped them at least once Four womenallege he kissed them without consent The governor stood behind a state trooper in a lift, running his finger down her neck and saying ""hey you"", according to investigators. On top of the allegations of harassment, Mr Cuomo is accused of presiding over a ""hostile and toxic work environment"". Joon Kim, who co-led the investigation, said: ""It was a culture where you could not say no to the governor and if you upset him or his senior staff you'd be written off, cast aside or worse."" In his statement, Mr Cuomo said: ""I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances. This video can not be played Watch: The allegations and Cuomoâs âI kiss peopleâ defence ""I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am. And that's not who I have ever been."" New York's senators, the Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand used the release of the investigation to again call for him to resign. ""Today's report from the New York State attorney general substantiated and corroborated the allegations of the brave women who came forward to share their stories - and we commend the women for doing so,"" they said. The investigation is civil, rather than criminal, so will not directly lead to charges. But police could use the report in deciding to take further action and it is also likely to play a key part in a separate impeachment investigation he faces - as well as in a criminal inquiry in Albany, the state's capital city. After a whirlwind of attention earlier this year, the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations had been held at a low simmer for months. The New York attorney general's report now brings them roaring back. Cuomo was able to survive the story's first wave through a mix of denials, apologies and hunkering down in hopes that the political storm would pass. He seems determined to follow the same strategy again. Even with the new revelations and the report's conclusion that the governor engaged in a ""pattern"" of misconduct, an organised effort to remove Cuomo through legislative impeachment will be a tough task. Where this report may draw political blood, however, is by further diminishing Cuomo's prospects for re-election next year. His popularity has been dented, his opponents have multiplied, and the Democratic establishment continues to distance itself from the man who was once one of the party's top stars. On Tuesday afternoon President Joe Biden - who had withheld his judgement until now - added his voice to the chorus calling for Cuomo to resign. The governor seems determined to hang on and fight, but with few allies and fewer options, his fate is all but sealed. The allegations and Cuomoâs 'I kiss people' defence.

Belarus opposition chief hopeful after Johnson talks,"Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was forced to flee Belarus in the wake of disputed elections The exiled Belarus opposition leader says she is sure the UK will offer further help to the country's people, amid a crackdown on dissent. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Boris Johnson had assured her the UK would put pressure on the Belarus government, at a meeting in Downing Street. It comes amid mass arrests following the disputed re-election of President Lukashenko in August 2020. The prime minister said the UK was ""very much"" on Ms Tikhanovskaya's side. The exiled opposition leader claimed victory in last year's Belarusian presidential election, after standing in place of her politician husband, who was detained in March 2020. Belarus jails top Lukashenko critic for 14 years Missing Belarus activist found dead in park Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus Forced to flee the country with her children on the day after the election, she now lives in Lithuania. She told reporters outside Downing Street she had not discussed ""concrete"" actions the UK might take with Mr Johnson, adding that this would require ""further work"". But asked if she thought such help would be offered by the UK, she replied: ""I am sure."" She said she saw in Mr Johnson ""a person who really shares common values with Belarusians"". Ms Tikhanovskaya's visit to London is her latest stop in a diplomatic tour of Europe It comes after Vitaly Shishov, the head of a group helping people who have fled Belarus, was found dead near his home in neighbouring Ukraine. Police said they were investigating whether he had been killed and his death made to look like suicide. Meanwhile, a Belarusian Olympic sprinter who feared for her safety has been granted a humanitarian visa by Poland. Ms Tikhanovskaya said it was too early to comment on Mr Shishov's death. But she said she was determined to carry on fighting the government of Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994. ""I know that even if I disappear one day this movement will continue without me,"" she added. She said the international community was ""doing a lot"" to help but that ""sometimes decisions should be taken very, very fast"". ""This regime will fall one day for sure,"" she said. Ms Tikhanovskaya gave a speech to UK-based supporters after her meeting in No 10 Before her meeting in London, she had said she would be pushing for the UK and Western allies to tighten sanctions on Belarus. Speaking to the Financial Times,external, she said European sanctions contained ""loopholes,"" and urged greater co-ordination with the United States. The UK's sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes on senior Belarusian officials - currently target a total of 99 people and nine organisations. The list was widened in June following the detention of opposition Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, after a Ryanair plane they were travelling in wasforced to divert and land in Belarus. At the same time, the EU updated its sanctions list to include a total of 166 persons and 15 entities. Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had been assured by Mr Johnson that the UK would help create ""multiple points of pressure"" on Mr Lukashenko's government. This would include assistance for Belarusian journalists forced to flee the country, and for democracy campaigners and charities, she added. Welcoming Ms Tikhanovskaya to Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ""We are very much on your side, very much in support of what you are doing. ""We are committed to supporting human rights and civil society in Belarus."" Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Alexander Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.

Terror attacker 'wanted to kill the Queen',"Sudesh Amman was shot dead on Streatham High Road A terrorist who stabbed two people became increasingly violent in prison and declared he wanted to ""kill the Queen"", an inquest has heard. Sudesh Amman was shot dead by police in Streatham, south London, in February 2020, ten days after leaving prison. While in HMP Belmarsh the 20-year-old openly expressed ""extreme views"" including his intention to become a suicide bomber, jurors were told. The inquest previously heardthere had been concerns about his release. Amman injured a man and woman in the attack on Streatham High Road on 2 February last year before he was killed by surveillance officers. He had been jailed for 40 months in 2018 for preparing and engaging in acts of terrorism, and was released on 23 January 2020. The 20-year-old was captured on CCTV footage during the attack Jurors at the Royal Courts of Justice were shown a prisoner report about the 20-year-old, which said he had ""been shouting different things on the wings such as 'this place is full of non-believers'... and 'everyone here will come under the black flag (of the Islamic State group)'."" About a month before his release date, a note in Arabic was found in his cell, saying he announced his allegiance to the Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr Al-Qurayshi Al-Baghdadi. Amman also ""appeared proud of being the youngest terrorist offender in Belmarsh... (and) didn't seem remorseful"", the inquest was told. Jurors heard that an assessment by Leon Campbell, a probation officer, said he posed a high risk of serious harm to members of the public ""due to his promoting of extremist ideasâ¦ and wanting to carry out a terrorist act"". Amman was jailed in 2018 for preparing and engaging in acts of terrorism A senior Met Police officer wrote to the governor of HMP Belmarsh on 15 January 2020 asking if Amman's release could be delayed but was told it was not possible, jurors have been told. Belmarsh's governor told the inquest Amman had been moved to a high security unit inside the prison ""on numerous occasions"" during his jail term because he was trying to convert other inmates. Intelligence shared with police by prison authorities in October 2019 had suggested he had been involved in radicalising others in Belmarsh. Jurors were shown a list of those he was involved with which included Hashem Abedi, who conspired with his brother Salman for theManchester arena terror attack. Amman served his sentence at HMP Belmarsh Jenny Louis explained that moving him in the prison had been a way ""to monitor him well but also stop his ability to influence others"". She also said he had repeatedly sought to disengage with prison staff, adding that it was ""very rare that you have somebody who disengages so openly whilst in custody"". Asked why it had not be possible to extend Amman's jail term as requested by police, Ms Louis said it was due to the imminence of his release. She also explained that an incident on 3 January 2020, where the 20-year-old had jumped on to internal netting inside the prison, was ""not an offence that would ever go to an independent adjudicator"" - the body which had the power to increase his sentence. The inquest continues.

We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates. As ever, any major developments will be covered on our main pages,here. Today's posts were written by Alexandra Fouche, Emma Harrison, Becky Morton and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke and Emma Owen. China is currently seeing one of its biggest Covid outbreaks in months And here is a round-up of what's been going on around the world: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly so here's a recap of the main developments in the UK today: Adam FlemingChief political correspondent For five days the government mulled the idea of an ""amber watchlist"" to warn travellers that the country they intended to visit could imminently turn from amber to red on the traffic light system for international travel. That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday. Read more from Adam here. Aboubakar FamauBBC News, Dodoma Tanzania is aiming to vaccinate 60% of its population Tanzanians
have today been arriving at one of its 550 vaccination centres to receive their jabs as a nationwide campaign begins. The country, which is facing a third wave
of the pandemic, has received a million doses of the single-jab Johnson
& Johnson vaccine from the US under the Covax scheme. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who got her injection last week, said Tanzania has placed another order for the vaccine
through the African Union as part of its plan to initially target more
than 60% of the population. The start of this  campaign comes at a
time when public opinion is divided over the safety of the vaccines. The president, who has shifted the country away from the Covid scepticism of her predecessor, has urged Tanzania to come out and get the jab. The country was one of the last on the continent to receive any vaccines. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is nowurging people not to travel unless necessary,,externalafter an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Nanjing has spread to other
cities. Cases of Covid-19 were first identified among workers at an
international airport in Nanjing on 20 July. Since then, official media have
confirmed cases have been detected in 15 provincial-level regions,
many of which are the Delta variant. There are 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. Cases linked to Nanjing have been identified in major
cities such as Chengdu and Beijing, and have led to local lockdowns. New caseshave now been detected in the city of Wuhan,the original Covid-19 epicentre,
for the first time since June 2020. There are also cases in Zhengzhou, a city that has experienced devastating
floods in recent weeks. China has not seen a widespread outbreak like this since
the beginning of the year, when an outbreak in the north-east city of
Shijiazhuang spread to multiple eastern provinces. The official Nanjing Daily has today confirmed a special quarantine base
with 2,000 roomswill now be built to treat patients in the city.,external Transport links in and out of Nanjing have largely been
suspended, and residents are currently undergoing a fourth round of Covid-19
tests. Nanjing has a population of 9.2 million people. Morocco is introducing new coronavirus restrictions, including a night curfew, as infection rates rise. The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK. Some 73% of the UKâs adult population is now fully vaccinated,according to the latest government figures.,external More than 38.5 million people have received two doses of a Covid vaccine

million people have had a first jab â 88.7% of the UK adult population. The UK has reported another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest
since late June. The last time case numbers were lower was on 29 June, when 20,479 were reported. There were also a further 138 deaths recorded within 28 days

administered as a share of population. And itâs also behind the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies, such as Japan, but
the US vaccination rate has dropped off more significantly than in other
developed countries. In the middle of April, the US was giving out more than three
million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this
is a slight increase on mid-July levels. BBC Reality Check has looked into where
vaccinations are lagging in the US, and why,here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story.

That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday.

cities. Cases of Covid-19 were first identified among workers at an
international airport in Nanjing on 20 July. Since then, official media have
confirmed cases have been detected in 15 provincial-level regions,
many of which are the Delta variant. There are 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. Cases linked to Nanjing have been identified in major
cities such as Chengdu and Beijing, and have led to local lockdowns. New caseshave now been detected in the city of Wuhan,the original Covid-19 epicentre,
for the first time since June 2020. There are also cases in Zhengzhou, a city that has experienced devastating
floods in recent weeks. China has not seen a widespread outbreak like this since
the beginning of the year, when an outbreak in the north-east city of
Shijiazhuang spread to multiple eastern provinces. The official Nanjing Daily has today confirmed a special quarantine base
with 2,000 roomswill now be built to treat patients in the city.,external Transport links in and out of Nanjing have largely been
suspended, and residents are currently undergoing a fourth round of Covid-19
tests. Nanjing has a population of 9.2 million people. Morocco is introducing new coronavirus restrictions, including a night curfew, as infection rates rise. The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK.

NY's Cuomo 'sexually harassed multiple women'The investigation comes months after several women accused Andrew Cuomo of sexual misconduct.US & Canada,"President Joe Biden has called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after a damning independent inquiry found the New York governor had harassed multiple women. Mr Biden's condemnation of Mr Cuomo came hours after the state's Attorney General Letitia James said the governor had violated state and federal laws. In response, Mr Cuomo denied touching anyone inappropriately and vowed to stay in office. Mr Cuomo could now be impeached, and is also facing a separate criminal probe. ""I think he should resign,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. ""I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact. I have not read all that data."" The attorney general's investigation into her fellow Democrat was commissioned last year after several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the governor. Investigators spent five months speaking to nearly 200 people, including staff members and some of those who made complaints against him. Tens of thousands of documents, texts and pictures were reviewed as part of the inquiry. ""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,"" Ms James said. Mr Cuomo, she said, had engaged in ""unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments"". In one case, Mr Cuomo and his staff retaliated against a former employee who accused him of wrongdoing, according to Ms James. Other women described being groped, kissed or sitting on the governor's lap. Mr Cuomo allegedly reached under the blouse of an assistant to touch her breast, while another aide said he asked her if she was open to sex with an older man. Eleven women have accused Governor Cuomo of misconduct. Eight womensay he made offensive, condescending or sexual comments Seven womensay he inappropriately touched or groped them at least once Four womenallege he kissed them without consent The governor stood behind a state trooper in a lift, running his finger down her neck and saying ""hey you"", according to investigators. On top of the allegations of harassment, Mr Cuomo is accused of presiding over a ""hostile and toxic work environment"". Joon Kim, who co-led the investigation, said: ""It was a culture where you could not say no to the governor and if you upset him or his senior staff you'd be written off, cast aside or worse."" In his statement, Mr Cuomo said: ""I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances. This video can not be played Watch: The allegations and Cuomoâs âI kiss peopleâ defence ""I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am. And that's not who I have ever been."" New York's senators, the Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand used the release of the investigation to again call for him to resign. ""Today's report from the New York State attorney general substantiated and corroborated the allegations of the brave women who came forward to share their stories - and we commend the women for doing so,"" they said. The investigation is civil, rather than criminal, so will not directly lead to charges. But police could use the report in deciding to take further action and it is also likely to play a key part in a separate impeachment investigation he faces - as well as in a criminal inquiry in Albany, the state's capital city. After a whirlwind of attention earlier this year, the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations had been held at a low simmer for months. The New York attorney general's report now brings them roaring back. Cuomo was able to survive the story's first wave through a mix of denials, apologies and hunkering down in hopes that the political storm would pass. He seems determined to follow the same strategy again. Even with the new revelations and the report's conclusion that the governor engaged in a ""pattern"" of misconduct, an organised effort to remove Cuomo through legislative impeachment will be a tough task. Where this report may draw political blood, however, is by further diminishing Cuomo's prospects for re-election next year. His popularity has been dented, his opponents have multiplied, and the Democratic establishment continues to distance itself from the man who was once one of the party's top stars. On Tuesday afternoon President Joe Biden - who had withheld his judgement until now - added his voice to the chorus calling for Cuomo to resign. The governor seems determined to hang on and fight, but with few allies and fewer options, his fate is all but sealed. The allegations and Cuomoâs 'I kiss people' defence.

We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story. Guidance for universities and colleges in Scotland on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms. Students will be asked to take a PCR test before moving to student accommodation and then asked to test twice a week thereafter. The first minister is now taking questions from MSPs -you can follow the latest on our Scotland live page. Spain welcomed 10 times more tourists in June than in the same month last year at the height of the pandemic. Some 2.2 million tourists entered Spain in June this year, nearly a quarter of them from Germany,the country's official statistical agency, INE, said,external. But the total is still only a quarter of the visitors before the coronavirus crisis. Spain's economy contracted sharply by 10.8% in 2020, one of the worst results in the eurozone, the AFP news agency reports.But it is now forecast to grow again this year,external. Here's a recap of the changes Nicola Sturgeon has just announced for Scotland from 9 August:  Read further detail on the changes in our story here.  Ms Sturgeon urges the public to ""continue to be careful, cautious, and sensible even as legal
restrictions are lifted"". ""We all hope that the restrictions we lift next Monday will
never have to be reimposed, but no one can guarantee that,"" she says. In winter the virus âmay well pose challenges for us againâ. She urges people to get the vaccine, test regularly and stick to the rules that remain in place, such as on face coverings. Meet outdoors as much as possible, she says, and ventilate the space if you are meeting indoors. Even if it is no longer legally mandated these measures are ""still
sensible precautionsâ, she says. Secondary school pupils will need to keep wearing masks for at least the first six weeks of the new term Nicola Sturgeon now sets out changes to guidance for schools. She says blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine and instead there will be a more targeted approach, with fewer young people asked to self-isolate. However, most other mitigations will remain for the first six weeks of the new academic term, the first minister says. This includes one metre social distancing between staff and pupils and face coverings for staff and children aged 12 and over. Sturgeon says these measures will be kept under review. All secondary pupils and staff will also be asked to take a lateral flow test before
returning after the holidays and twice a week after that. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Drug deaths at highest level since 1993,"The number of drug-related deaths recorded in England and Wales in 2020 was the highest since records began in 1993. In total, 4,561 deaths related to drug poisoning were registered - equivalent to a rate of 79.5 per million people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said about half of these would have occurred in 2019, because of delays in registering deaths. The majority will have occurred before the pandemic, it added. The latest figures, which are published annually,external, show stark differences between men and women, and among different regions. There were more than twice as many deaths among men as there were among women. The highest rate of deaths relating to drug misuse was in the North East of England, where 104.6 deaths were recorded per million people, and the lowest was in London, where that figure was 33.1. The DJ helping stop weird, wired cocaine weekends Review urges extra Â£552m for drug user treatments In terms of age, the highest rate was among people aged 45-49. The total death toll is 3.8% higher than the figure for 2019, when 4,393 deaths were recorded. The ONS suggested the increase could possibly be down to an ageing cohort of drug users suffering from the effects of long-term use, as well as new trends in taking certain drugs - including gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines - at the same time as heroin or morphine. Of the total deaths registered in 2020, 2,263 - around half - involved an opiate. And 777 of the deaths involved cocaine - a rise of about 10% on 2019, and more than quadruple the number recorded in 2010. Georgina Gorin, 35, started drinking heavily and taking drugs as a teenager. She didn't expect that years later she would lose her children and her home. She never thought she would be taking hard Class A drugs on the streets of Rochdale. And she couldn't have known that in the first Covid lockdown, bored and alone in an empty flat, her drinking addiction would spiral to another level. ""I knew that I was on the verge of death,"" she tells the BBC. ""I rang my mum up at midnight crying because I wanted to die."" She spent a month in a treatment centre and has been sober since last May. But it wasn't the first time she had sought help. She had attended sessions funded by the council on and off for years - and says they need more funding if they are to help those who need it most. ""Everything got cut. Even the one-to-ones went from an hour to half an hour, and then it went to once a month rather than every week. Things just weren't available when you needed them,"" she says. ""You go into the doctors and you say, 'I think I've got a problem', so they refer you - but the waiting list is months - you might be dead before then."" Now 15 months sober, Georgina volunteers with the charity Turning Point and is able to see her children again. ""It's just wonderful. Just for today I can say that I haven't got any problems,"" she laughs down the phone. ""It's just so nice to be able to be free and just know that today is a good day."" Last weekScotland, which records figures separately,reported that more than 1,300 people died of drug misuse last year - the highest figure for a seventh year running. The ONS figures come afteran independent review said spending cutshad left recovery services for drug addicts ""on their knees"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers would ""look closely"" at the recommendations from Dame Carol Black, who called for an extra Â£552m investment over five years in England. The government said it would set up a new cross-government unit on tackling drug misuse. Commenting on the ONS figures, Dr Emily Finch, vice-chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""Years of cuts have left addictions services ill-equipped to treat people and prevent these deaths from rising."" She added: ""The government needs to wake up to the fact that cuts to services, disconnecting NHS mental health services from addiction services and shifting the focus away from harm reduction to abstinence-based recovery is destroying lives and fuelling the increase in drug-related deaths."" Eytan Alexander, chief executive of the UK Addiction Treatment Group, said there was a ""parallel pandemic"" of drug, alcohol and mental health issues that had ""only worsened due to the virus"". Clare Taylor, national director of operations at Turning Point, said isolation, financial insecurity and fear during the pandemic ""has hit many of those who were already vulnerable including people with a history of drug or alcohol problems"". ""Every drug or alcohol related death is preventable, and our thoughts are with anyone who has lost someone this way,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""Any death due to drug misuse is a tragedy. To prevent people losing their lives to drug abuse we're launching a consultation today to improve access to naloxone. This will allow those working with addicts, including police, paramedics and prison officers, to administer the drug which helps reverse the effects of opioid overdose and save lives. ""We are already investing Â£148m to tackle the root causes of drug misuse including Â£80m for treatment and recovery -  the largest investment in the drug treatment system for 15 years.""

Most Covid rules to end in Scotland from 9 AugustSocial distancing will no longer be required in most locations - but the wearing of face coverings will continue.ScotlandComments,"Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Social distancing will be dropped in most settings, meaning more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts. And close contacts of those who test positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate - as long as they are fully vaccinated and test negative. However, the wearing of face coverings in some public spaces will continue. This will include secondary schools, where staff will need to maintain 1m physical distancing for the first six weeks of term and twice-weekly testing will be required. Full coverage of Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement Self-isolation of whole classes 'no longer routine' What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? The first minister also said a ""gradual approach"" will be taken to returning workers to offices, warning that the virus still poses ""real challenges"". While the changes would restore a ""substantial degree of normality"", she said they do not ""signal the end of the pandemic or a return to life exactly as we knew it"". She said: ""Declaring freedom from or victory over this virus is in my view premature."" The number of new Covid-19 cases has fallen markedly from the peak of the ""third wave"", with Ms Sturgeon saying the infection rate had fallen by two-thirds since early July. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement in a virtual statement to MSPs The percentage of tests coming back positive has also fallen, as has the number of patients being admitted to hospital and intensive care wards with the virus. The first minister said uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine had been ""exceptional"", and that this - along with the fall in cases - made it possible to lift most of the legal restrictions still in force. From Monday, 9 August, the current limits on the number of people who can meet up will be dropped, as will social distancing rules in most settings. This means nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and larger crowds will be allowed to gather for indoor and outdoor events - although organisers of large eventswill still need to apply to local councils for permission. The rules around self-isolation will also change, meaning that fully-vaccinated adults who are identified as a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to isolate if they return a negative PCR test. The use of face coverings will continue in secondary schools for the first part of the new term The government is still considering whether a certificate proving people have been vaccinated will be needed to enter ""higher-risk"" events. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that a ""Covid status certification"" app was under development, but said she was ""considering very carefully"" whether such a scheme would be appropriate. She also said she would not hesitate to take the ""tough decision"" to re-impose some local restrictions if there was a serious outbreak of the virus, saying the government ""will seek to take whatever action is necessary to keep the country safe"". While most restrictions will be lifted, a number of ""mitigations"" will remain in place, with Ms Sturgeon saying the harm of the virus ""cannot be underestimated"". The use of face coverings in enclosed spaces like shops, hospitality venues and public transport will remain ""for some time"" to come, and venues will still be expected to collect customer details for contact tracing. The first minister said it was ""vital"" that the return to working in offices was a gradual one, saying employers should consider a ""hybrid"" model of home and in-office work. Two weeks after restrictions were lifted in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. That's why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. The move was broadly welcomed by business groups, although some still voiced fears about the economic recovery. The Federation of Small Businesses said firms would be ""elated"" that the bulk of curbs were being lifted, but trading conditions had been ""permanently changed by the crisis"". CBI Scotland said moving beyond level zero ""creates a much-needed platform for kickstarting Scotland's economic recovery"", but said firms would be ""confused"" about why ministers were still advising people to work from home. And the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said hundreds of pubs would now reopen for the first time, hailing this as ""fantastic news"" - adding that it was ""vital that we get the recovery phase right"". The changes will allow hospitality venues to increase capacity The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer recess for the announcement, giving opposition leaders the chance to question the first minister on the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the statement was a ""mixed bag"", saying that ""ongoing restrictions will hold Scotland's recovery back"". He said: ""We have moved beyond level zero - but still curbs remain in place. Yet again the goalposts have been moved. We are at level minus one or minus two, and still the government is clinging on to parts of people's lives."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there was ""definitely light at the end of the tunnel"", but said ""we are at a crucial point for Scotland's recovery"". He called for a ""new approach"" in the fight against the pandemic, calling for increased support for the test and trace system and pop-up vaccination clinics at sporting events and universities.

"Hiding student fell to death at lockdown partyRumours of a police raid prompted Tom Miller to climb out of a window, an inquest hears.Nottingham","Tom Miller was a keen rugby player and charity ambassador A student fell to his death while hiding during a lockdown-defying party, an inquest has heard. Tom Miller, 24, went to the event in Tennyson Street, in the Radford area of Nottingham, on 5 December 2020. Nottingham Coroner's Court heard after midnight, council officers called on the house to warn them about noise. Rumours of arrests caused some people to hide, with Mr Miller getting on the roof and then soon after falling and suffering fatal injuries. The party took place while Nottingham was subject to tier three coronavirus restrictions, which banned different households mixing indoors. The court heard from PC Kate Gledhill of Nottinghamshire Police, who said the community protection officers gave a warning about noise and left. Mr Miller and a friend had filmed themselves sitting on the roof shortly before they fell Some partygoers claimed there had been a second visit but PC Gledhill said there was no record of this. But stories of a police presence caused a ""ripple effect"" with people going into bedrooms and the garden. PC Gledhill said: ""Tom travelled upstairs and found a small window which gave access to a ledge and then a section of roof. ""He filmed himself there and sent messages to friends, inviting one up to join him."" After spending a short time on the roof, his friend went to urinate but slipped. PC Gledhill said the pair became ""entangled"" and both fell. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Keen rugby player and Nottingham Trent University (NTU) student Mr Miller suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital the next day. The friend suffered less serious injuries. Recording a verdict of accidental death, assistant coroner Laurinda Bower said: ""This was a tragic case which led to the death of someone who was clearly highly regarded among his friends. ""It has had a profound and ongoing impact on those who were there and the wider university."" NTU Sport Head of Rugby Union, David Ross, said: ""Tom was an outstanding role model and leader within our rugby programme and will be sadly missed by his rugby brothers and the wider sporting community.""

NY governor 'sexually harassed multiple women',"President Joe Biden has called on Andrew Cuomo to resign after a damning independent inquiry found the New York governor had harassed multiple women. Mr Biden's condemnation of Mr Cuomo came hours after the state's Attorney General Letitia James said the governor had violated state and federal laws. In response, Mr Cuomo denied touching anyone inappropriately and vowed to stay in office. Mr Cuomo could now be impeached, and is also facing a separate criminal probe. ""I think he should resign,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. ""I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact. I have not read all that data."" The attorney general's investigation into her fellow Democrat was commissioned last year after several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the governor. Investigators spent five months speaking to nearly 200 people, including staff members and some of those who made complaints against him. Tens of thousands of documents, texts and pictures were reviewed as part of the inquiry. ""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,"" Ms James said. Mr Cuomo, she said, had engaged in ""unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments"". In one case, Mr Cuomo and his staff retaliated against a former employee who accused him of wrongdoing, according to Ms James. Other women described being groped, kissed or sitting on the governor's lap. Mr Cuomo allegedly reached under the blouse of an assistant to touch her breast, while another aide said he asked her if she was open to sex with an older man. Eleven women have accused Governor Cuomo of misconduct. Eight womensay he made offensive, condescending or sexual comments Seven womensay he inappropriately touched or groped them at least once Four womenallege he kissed them without consent The governor stood behind a state trooper in a lift, running his finger down her neck and saying ""hey you"", according to investigators. On top of the allegations of harassment, Mr Cuomo is accused of presiding over a ""hostile and toxic work environment"". Joon Kim, who co-led the investigation, said: ""It was a culture where you could not say no to the governor and if you upset him or his senior staff you'd be written off, cast aside or worse."" In his statement, Mr Cuomo said: ""I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances. This video can not be played Watch: The allegations and Cuomoâs âI kiss peopleâ defence ""I am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am. And that's not who I have ever been."" New York's senators, the Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand used the release of the investigation to again call for him to resign. ""Today's report from the New York State attorney general substantiated and corroborated the allegations of the brave women who came forward to share their stories - and we commend the women for doing so,"" they said. The investigation is civil, rather than criminal, so will not directly lead to charges. But police could use the report in deciding to take further action and it is also likely to play a key part in a separate impeachment investigation he faces - as well as in a criminal inquiry in Albany, the state's capital city. After a whirlwind of attention earlier this year, the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations had been held at a low simmer for months. The New York attorney general's report now brings them roaring back. Cuomo was able to survive the story's first wave through a mix of denials, apologies and hunkering down in hopes that the political storm would pass. He seems determined to follow the same strategy again. Even with the new revelations and the report's conclusion that the governor engaged in a ""pattern"" of misconduct, an organised effort to remove Cuomo through legislative impeachment will be a tough task. Where this report may draw political blood, however, is by further diminishing Cuomo's prospects for re-election next year. His popularity has been dented, his opponents have multiplied, and the Democratic establishment continues to distance itself from the man who was once one of the party's top stars. On Tuesday afternoon President Joe Biden - who had withheld his judgement until now - added his voice to the chorus calling for Cuomo to resign. The governor seems determined to hang on and fight, but with few allies and fewer options, his fate is all but sealed. The allegations and Cuomoâs 'I kiss people' defence.

Civilians urged to evacuate besieged Afghan city,"Afghan forces are battling the Taliban in Lashkar Gah Residents of a besieged Afghan city have been urged to evacuate ahead of an army operation against the Taliban. General Sami Sadat, who is leading the battle against the Taliban in the southern province of Helmand, called on people to leave its capital Lashkar Gah as soon as possible. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day amid intense fighting, the UN says. The Taliban are reported to have captured most of the city. But the fighting is continuing and government forces have vowed not to let it fall into militant hands. In a message to residents of the city, Gen Sadat said the army would ""not leave a single Taliban alive"". ""I know it is very difficult for you to leave your houses - it is hard for us too - but if you are displaced for a few days please forgive us,"" he said. Gen Sadat earlier told the BBC that while government forces had lost ground, he believed the Taliban would be unable to sustain their assault. The Taliban assault in Helmand province is part of a major offensive across Afghanistan. The militants have made rapid advancesin recent months as US forces have withdrawn after 20 years of military operations in the country. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign, and any Taliban gains there would be a blow for the Afghan government. If Lashkar Gah fell, it would be the first provincial capital won by the Taliban since 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. Residents of Lashkar Gah say they are living in fear as the city faces heavy assault from the militants, who are being targeted with US and Afghan air strikes. ""Neither the Taliban will have mercy on us nor will the government stop the bombing. There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" one resident told the BBC. Another said: ""I do not know where to go, there are clashes in every corner of the city."" Who are the Taliban? How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) says civilians are ""bearing the brunt"" of the fighting, with the Taliban ground offensive and Afghan air strikes causing the most harm. It has called on both sides to do more to protect civilians, including an immediate end to fighting in urban areas. In addition to the fatalities, dozens of people have been injured and thousands displaced, according to Unama. Doctors in Lashkar Gah say they are overwhelmed and running low on supplies. ""There is fighting all around,"" one told the BBC. An Afghan interpreter living in the city said his life was under threat from the Taliban because he had worked for the British forces. ""My own house which I left yesterday has been captured by the Taliban and they are living there and they were asking for me,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen in the future but they are looking from house to house to find the people who worked for Nato."" Gen Sadat told the BBC the Taliban were being supported by fighters from other Islamist groups and warned that their gains posed a threat beyond Afghanistan. ""This will increase the hope for small extremist groups to mobilise in the cities of Europe and America, and will have a devastating effect on global security,"" he said. ""This is not a war of Afghanistan, this is a war between liberty and totalitarianism."" Lashkar Gah is one of three provincial capitals under attack. Attempts by the militants to captureKandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, have continued after rocket strikes hit its airport on Sunday. Seizing control of Kandahar would be a huge victory for the Taliban, giving them a grip on the south of the country. Unama says five civilians have been killed and 42 wounded over the past three days. In a third besieged city,Herat, in the west, government commandos are battling the insurgents after days of fierce fighting. Government forces have taken back some areas after a UN compound was attacked on Friday. Videos shared on social media appeared to show residents on the streets and rooftops of Herat shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") in support of the government's gains. As government forces struggled to contain Taliban advances, President Ashraf Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of US troops for the increase in fighting. ""The reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly,"" he told parliament on Monday. Mr Ghani said he had warned Washington that the withdrawal would have ""consequences"". Although nearly all its military forces have left, the US has continued its air offensive in support of government troops. President Biden's administration announced on Monday that because of the increase in violence, it wouldtake in thousands more Afghan refugees who worked with US forces. The US and UK have accused the Taliban of committing possible war crimes by ""massacring civilians"" in a town captured near the Pakistan border. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had seen reports of ""deeply disturbing"" Taliban atrocities. Gruesome videos that emerged from Spin Boldak apparently showed revenge killings.

"Belarus opposition chief hopeful after Johnson talksSvetlana Tikhanovskaya says she has been assured of further UK support, amid a crackdown on dissent.UK Politics","Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was forced to flee Belarus in the wake of disputed elections The exiled Belarus opposition leader says she is sure the UK will offer further help to the country's people, amid a crackdown on dissent. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Boris Johnson had assured her the UK would put pressure on the Belarus government, at a meeting in Downing Street. It comes amid mass arrests following the disputed re-election of President Lukashenko in August 2020. The prime minister said the UK was ""very much"" on Ms Tikhanovskaya's side. The exiled opposition leader claimed victory in last year's Belarusian presidential election, after standing in place of her politician husband, who was detained in March 2020. Belarus jails top Lukashenko critic for 14 years Missing Belarus activist found dead in park Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus Forced to flee the country with her children on the day after the election, she now lives in Lithuania. She told reporters outside Downing Street she had not discussed ""concrete"" actions the UK might take with Mr Johnson, adding that this would require ""further work"". But asked if she thought such help would be offered by the UK, she replied: ""I am sure."" She said she saw in Mr Johnson ""a person who really shares common values with Belarusians"". Ms Tikhanovskaya's visit to London is her latest stop in a diplomatic tour of Europe It comes after Vitaly Shishov, the head of a group helping people who have fled Belarus, was found dead near his home in neighbouring Ukraine. Police said they were investigating whether he had been killed and his death made to look like suicide. Meanwhile, a Belarusian Olympic sprinter who feared for her safety has been granted a humanitarian visa by Poland. Ms Tikhanovskaya said it was too early to comment on Mr Shishov's death. But she said she was determined to carry on fighting the government of Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994. ""I know that even if I disappear one day this movement will continue without me,"" she added. She said the international community was ""doing a lot"" to help but that ""sometimes decisions should be taken very, very fast"". ""This regime will fall one day for sure,"" she said. Ms Tikhanovskaya gave a speech to UK-based supporters after her meeting in No 10 Before her meeting in London, she had said she would be pushing for the UK and Western allies to tighten sanctions on Belarus. Speaking to the Financial Times,external, she said European sanctions contained ""loopholes,"" and urged greater co-ordination with the United States. The UK's sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes on senior Belarusian officials - currently target a total of 99 people and nine organisations. The list was widened in June following the detention of opposition Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, after a Ryanair plane they were travelling in wasforced to divert and land in Belarus. At the same time, the EU updated its sanctions list to include a total of 166 persons and 15 entities. Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had been assured by Mr Johnson that the UK would help create ""multiple points of pressure"" on Mr Lukashenko's government. This would include assistance for Belarusian journalists forced to flee the country, and for democracy campaigners and charities, she added. Welcoming Ms Tikhanovskaya to Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ""We are very much on your side, very much in support of what you are doing. ""We are committed to supporting human rights and civil society in Belarus."" Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Alexander Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.

Cut state pension age to 60 call rejectedThe government says lowering the state pension age is not fair or affordable for taxpayers.UK PoliticsComments,"Calls to return the state pension age to 60 for men and women have been rejected by the government. The Department for Work and Pensions says lowering the age of entitlement would be ""neither affordable nor fair"". More than 70,000 people have signed a Commons petition calling for a reduction to be introduced with immediate effect. The age threshold was increased to 66 for everyone last year with further phased increases to age 68 planned. Compensation closer for women's pensions campaign Why the pension triple lock is in the spotlight Chancellor hints at ruling out 8% pension rise Until 2010, the state pension age was 60 for women and 65 for men, but qualifying ages were brought in line for everyone by 2018 and have been rising since. In 2020, a further change to the rules required men and women born between 6 October, 1954, and 5 April, 1960, to have to wait until their 66th birthday to receive their pension. Campaigners say the coronavirus pandemic has put a renewed focus on intergenerational fairness, with many young people losing their jobs and struggling to find work. They say the balance needs to brought ""back in to young people's favour"" to help ""restore their future"". And they want older people to be allowed to retire earlier, to free up employment for younger workers. While there would be a financial cost to the Treasury, they say paying pension benefits earlier would be ""more positive"" than having to top young people up with Universal Credit. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says lowering the state pension age to 60 would place an unaffordable and unfair burden on taxpayers. It would also make the benefit unsustainable in the long term, the department argues in its response to the petition. The number of people over state pension age compared to the working population is expected to increase because, on average, people are living longer, according to the Office for National Statistics. Had the state pension age not risen for men and women, ""the total additional cost to taxpayers would have been around Â£215bn for the period 2010/11 to 2025/26, in 2018/19 prices,"" the DWP said. It added that ministers have provided ""an unprecedented amount of support via our plan for jobs to help those of all ages find work and get the skills they need to return to work"".

Scotland to move 'beyond level zero' next week,"Most Covid restrictions in Scotland will end next week, the first minister has confirmed, with the country moving ""beyond level zero"" from 9 August All premises that are currently closed - including nightclubs - will be able to open, with social distancing measures and limits on gatherings removed But people must still wear face coverings in indoor settings such as shops Double vaccinated adults will not automatically have to self-isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with someone who tests positive Instead, they will take a PCR test and can end their isolation if they test negative, with similar rules in place for under-17s Current mitigation measures in schools, such as distancing and facemasks in secondary schools, will remain for now Ms Sturgeon also says the vaccination programme will have to continue for some time A further 1,016 positive tests have been recorded in the past 24 hours, along with the deaths of a further nine people who had previously tested positive A weekly update on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has updated parliament on the latest stage of easing of Covid
restrictions. From Monday (9 August), Scotland
will move beyond the current level 0, lifting most of the
remaining legally imposed restrictions. This is most notably removing physical distancing
and limits to the size of social gatherings. It also means that from 9 August, no venues will be
legally required to close. However, a number of measures will remain
in place. These include: 1.Face coverings must be worn in all the same indoor
settings. This is likely to be law for some time
to come. 2. Indoor hospitality and
similar venues will continue to collect the contact details of customers. 3.Localised
restrictions will be used if necessary to control outbreaks. Travel
restrictions could also be used. 4.The advice remains
to continue home-working where possible. 5.Large-scale
events will, for a limited period, need to apply for permission. This applies to
outdoor events of more than 5,000 and indoor events of more than 2000. Rules of self-isolation to change  Changes in schools Question from Janet in Glasgow Everyone is now being offered rapid Covid tests which can be taken at home twice per week. You do the test yourself, and the result is available after 30 minutes. Lateral flow home test kits are free, andcan be ordered online to be delivered in the post,external. Or you canpick them up from a convenient location,external. The public are asked to take these tests - which are for people without symptoms - to help find cases of Covid that could otherwise go undetected. This is because about one in three people with Covid do not have any symptoms - although they can still spread the virus to others, who may then get sick. SNP MSP Elena Whitham raises the concerns of the many people who are taking immunosuppressant drugs, which could reduce the effectiveness of the Covid vaccine. She asks if immunosuppressed people could be given antibody tests to assess the effectiveness of the Covid vaccination. The first minister says currently the advice is to use antibody tests to improve understanding of Covid. However clinicians, including GPs, have the discretion to request an antibody test for an individual if they think the result will be of benefit to the clinical management of that patient, she says. Ms Sturgeon says the vaccine offers significant protection to the general population but there is not yet evidence of how effective it is for people with an impaired immune system. She says people in this situation should continue to be cautious and take sensible precautions. Question from Stuart in Glasgow The first minister has confirmed today that outdoor events can welcome up to 5,000 fans from 9 August without having to apply for extra permissions. But if the crowd is going to exceed 5,000 people, then the organisers  must still apply to their local authority for permission. Organisers have to submit an operations and risk assessment to prove they are keeping spectators safe. The local authority will then consider the plans and can grant permission. This application process will only remain ""for a limited period"", Ms Sturgeon said. Andrew McRae, policy chairman for the Federation of Small Business (FSB) Scotland, said business leaders would feel ""a cocktail of elation and worry"" after hearing the statement. ""The removal of the public health restrictions doesnât guarantee the recovery of either an individual business or a local economy,"" he said. ""Operators now face trading conditions permanently changed by the crisis and new debt that theyâll need to manage in the months and years to come."" Businesses have welcomed the first minister's announcement, including the chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association Emma McClarkin - who said more than 200 pubs would be able to reopen for the first time. She said: âThis is the confirmation that so many in our sector have been desperate
to hear. It is fantastic news for our pubs which have
suffered more than most sectors over the last 15 months. ""It is estimated that Scotland has lost 285 pubs for good since the start
of the pandemic and hundreds more remaining at risk, with a need
to reduce the tax and regulatory burden that they face.""  Question from Dean in Edinburgh Yes, indoor events, such as concerts will be able to make a ""careful return"", Ms Sturgeon said. But, she said that for a ""limited period"" organisers of indoor events of more than 2,000 people (and outdoor events of more than 5,000 people) would have to apply for permission. This will allow local authorities to check that there are safety measures in place to reduce risk. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola
Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over
the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From
next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after
the initial lockdown. That
includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that
limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of
nightclubs. This
is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital
admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The
big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask
wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and
for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The
Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first
minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur asks the first minister to rule out domestic vaccine passports. Ms Sturgeon says again that she is far from convinced they are the right thing to do but she does not want to close down the debate at this stage. ""If there is one thing I have learned over these grim, challenging, difficult 18 months it is that, in the face of an infectious virus that kept adapting to make the challenge more difficult, I don't think it is sensible just to rule things out for ideological or other reasons,"" she says.

Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie says he is concerned by the continued emphasis on Covid status certificates - so-called vaccine passports. He says he is particularly concerned in relation to ""high-risk venues"" such as nightclubs. Mr Harvie says vaccine passports raise human rights implications if the ability to live our lives is dependent on our health status. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Mr Harvie is right that vaccines do not eliminate all risk and harm despite being hugely effective. However, she denies that she is placing ""emphasis"" on vaccine passports. She says the app being developed will have the Covid status functionality but there are no plans to immediately use it. ""I am highly cautious about Covid passports for all the reasons that Patrick Harvie has set out,"" she says. ""But there is a debate to be had about whether they could play some part.""

Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent School restrictions are now tougher than
those for the rest of society. Secondary pupils have to wear a mask at all
times and one metre distancing remains between adult staff. Teachers were given a guarantee that no
rules would change on day one but these current restrictions look set to remain
for at least six weeks. It shows a nervousness from the government
about large groups of unvaccinated teenagers mixing when term starts -  as
early as next week for some. The return of schools last August saw the
beginning of an upward trend of cases. Ministers are hoping that holding their
nerve now, keeping strict rules for pupils, will prevent history repeating. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says vaccination has been key to reducing harm from Covid. ""We must maintain the progress and intensity of the programme,"" he says. In recent weeks the seven-day average rate of vaccinations has reduced, Mr Sarwar says. He calls for all barriers to vaccination to be removed - saying there should be more pop-up vaccination centres in hard-to-reach areas and even door-to-door jabs. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the vaccination programme is going ""extremely well"" but she is looking at all possible ways to get people to access vaccination services. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asks if the first minister is considering imposing another local lockdown or travel ban and how will it be enforced. He calls Ms Sturgeon's announcement a ""mixed bag"", but she argues it is ""sensible and cautious"", accusing the Conservatives of ""trying to undermine"" her communication at times. On future lockdowns, she said: ""I fervently hope that will not be necessary"", adding that the risk of such measures will be minimised if people continue to exercise care and caution. However, she concludes by saying if she believed a lockdown was necessary to curb an outbreak or new variant that put lives at risk, ""no matter how unpopular I would take that decision, because
thatâs what Iâm elected to do"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August.
Here are the main points: Question from Daniel in Greenock Yes, you will still have to provide your contact details. The first minister confirmed in her statement that Scotland's contact tracing service - Test & Protect - would continue to
contact-trace positive cases of Covid. She said there would be an ""ongoing requirement for indoor hospitality and similar venues to collect the contact details of customers"" to assist with this. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in
England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow
suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases
at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the
more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has
helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact
with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With
vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to
keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to
predict. We will see a return to schools and
universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season
and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of
face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but
Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. Question from Stuart in Melrose Not yet, if you can work from home. The first minister has said that the advice will continue to be work from home where possible. She said: ""We will continue to advise home working
where possible for now. ""I know most businesses are not planning a wholesale
return to the office, while recognising
that a return for some staff will be beneficial to them and their employers. ""It is vital that this gradual approach continues."" She also said the Scottish government was encouraging employers to consider adopting a ""hybrid"" model of home and
office working - which she said might have ""benefits beyond the need to control
a virus."" The first minister ends her statement by saying people still need to be ""careful,
cautious and sensible"", even as legal restrictions are lifted. She says she hopes the restrictions that will be lifted next Monday will never have to be reimposed. ""But
no-one can guarantee that"", she says. ""This virus remains a threat - and as we enter winter,
it may well pose challenges for us again,"" she says. Ms Sturgeon adds that when restrictions are lifted it inevitably gives the virus more opportunities
to spread. ""It becomes even more important for us to remember the basic
actions that can reduce risk,"" she says. Guidance for universities and colleges on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms. Students will be asked to take a PCR test before moving to student accommodation and then asked to test twice a week thereafter. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sturgeon details changes to Scotland's Covid rules,"The UK reports another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest since late June Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon confirms Social distancing will be dropped in most settings but a number of mitigation measures will remain in place It means more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts Meanwhile, a proposal to create an ""amber watchlist"" of travel destinations has been abandoned by the UK government It would have warned people when a country was at risk of a sudden shift to the more-restricted red list Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the air travel industry body Airlines UK, says it is a ""victory for common sense"" Deaths in the UK mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate rose by 46% in the week to 23 July, the Office for National Statistics says Qantas says it will stand down 2,500 staff as a lockdown in Sydney impacts air travel across Australia Authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan will begin testing its entire population, after some coronavirus cases were found Edited by Emma Owen Goodbye and thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates. As ever, any major developments will be covered on our main pages,here. Today's posts were written by Alexandra Fouche, Emma Harrison, Becky Morton and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke and Emma Owen. China is currently seeing one of its biggest Covid outbreaks in months And here is a round-up of what's been going on around the world: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly so here's a recap of the main developments in the UK today: Adam FlemingChief political correspondent For five days the government mulled the idea of an ""amber watchlist"" to warn travellers that the country they intended to visit could imminently turn from amber to red on the traffic light system for international travel. That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday. Read more from Adam here. Aboubakar FamauBBC News, Dodoma Tanzania is aiming to vaccinate 60% of its population Tanzanians
have today been arriving at one of its 550 vaccination centres to receive their jabs as a nationwide campaign begins. The country, which is facing a third wave
of the pandemic, has received a million doses of the single-jab Johnson
& Johnson vaccine from the US under the Covax scheme. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who got her injection last week, said Tanzania has placed another order for the vaccine
through the African Union as part of its plan to initially target more
than 60% of the population. The start of this  campaign comes at a
time when public opinion is divided over the safety of the vaccines. The president, who has shifted the country away from the Covid scepticism of her predecessor, has urged Tanzania to come out and get the jab. The country was one of the last on the continent to receive any vaccines. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is nowurging people not to travel unless necessary,,externalafter an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Nanjing has spread to other
cities. Cases of Covid-19 were first identified among workers at an
international airport in Nanjing on 20 July. Since then, official media have
confirmed cases have been detected in 15 provincial-level regions,
many of which are the Delta variant. There are 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. Cases linked to Nanjing have been identified in major
cities such as Chengdu and Beijing, and have led to local lockdowns. New caseshave now been detected in the city of Wuhan,the original Covid-19 epicentre,
for the first time since June 2020. There are also cases in Zhengzhou, a city that has experienced devastating
floods in recent weeks. China has not seen a widespread outbreak like this since
the beginning of the year, when an outbreak in the north-east city of
Shijiazhuang spread to multiple eastern provinces. The official Nanjing Daily has today confirmed a special quarantine base

The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK.

Reality Check The US has now given one dose of vaccine to 70% of all adults,externalâ a target originally set for 4 July by President Joe Biden. After being one of the top nations for its vaccine rollout
earlier in the year, the US is now behind neighbouring Canada in terms of doses
administered as a share of population. And itâs also behind the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies, such as Japan, but
the US vaccination rate has dropped off more significantly than in other
developed countries. In the middle of April, the US was giving out more than three
million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this
is a slight increase on mid-July levels. BBC Reality Check has looked into where
vaccinations are lagging in the US, and why,here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story. Guidance for universities and colleges in Scotland on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms. Students will be asked to take a PCR test before moving to student accommodation and then asked to test twice a week thereafter.

Spain welcomed 10 times more tourists in June than in the same month last year at the height of the pandemic. Some 2.2 million tourists entered Spain in June this year, nearly a quarter of them from Germany,the country's official statistical agency, INE, said,external. But the total is still only a quarter of the visitors before the coronavirus crisis. Spain's economy contracted sharply by 10.8% in 2020, one of the worst results in the eurozone, the AFP news agency reports.But it is now forecast to grow again this year,external. Here's a recap of the changes Nicola Sturgeon has just announced for Scotland from 9 August:  Read further detail on the changes in our story here.  Ms Sturgeon urges the public to ""continue to be careful, cautious, and sensible even as legal
restrictions are lifted"". ""We all hope that the restrictions we lift next Monday will
never have to be reimposed, but no one can guarantee that,"" she says. In winter the virus âmay well pose challenges for us againâ. She urges people to get the vaccine, test regularly and stick to the rules that remain in place, such as on face coverings. Meet outdoors as much as possible, she says, and ventilate the space if you are meeting indoors. Even if it is no longer legally mandated these measures are ""still
sensible precautionsâ, she says. Secondary school pupils will need to keep wearing masks for at least the first six weeks of the new term Nicola Sturgeon now sets out changes to guidance for schools. She says blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine and instead there will be a more targeted approach, with fewer young people asked to self-isolate. However, most other mitigations will remain for the first six weeks of the new academic term, the first minister says. This includes one metre social distancing between staff and pupils and face coverings for staff and children aged 12 and over. Sturgeon says these measures will be kept under review. All secondary pupils and staff will also be asked to take a lateral flow test before
returning after the holidays and twice a week after that. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Breaking|Breaking newsMost Covid rules to end in Scotland from 9 AugustSocial distancing no longer be required in most locations - but the wearing of face coverings will continue.Scotland,"Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Social distancing will be dropped in most settings, meaning more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts. And close contacts of those who test positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate - as long as they are fully vaccinated and test negative. However, the wearing of face coverings in some public spaces will continue. This will include secondary schools, where staff will need to maintain 1m physical distancing for the first six weeks of term and twice-weekly testing will be required. Full coverage of Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement Self-isolation of whole classes 'no longer routine' What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? The first minister also said a ""gradual approach"" will be taken to returning workers to offices, warning that the virus still poses ""real challenges"". While the changes would restore a ""substantial degree of normality"", she said they do not ""signal the end of the pandemic or a return to life exactly as we knew it"". She said: ""Declaring freedom from or victory over this virus is in my view premature."" The number of new Covid-19 cases has fallen markedly from the peak of the ""third wave"", with Ms Sturgeon saying the infection rate had fallen by two-thirds since early July. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement in a virtual statement to MSPs The percentage of tests coming back positive has also fallen, as has the number of patients being admitted to hospital and intensive care wards with the virus. The first minister said uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine had been ""exceptional"", and that this - along with the fall in cases - made it possible to lift most of the legal restrictions still in force. From Monday, 9 August, the current limits on the number of people who can meet up will be dropped, as will social distancing rules in most settings. This means nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and larger crowds will be allowed to gather for indoor and outdoor events - although organisers of large eventswill still need to apply to local councils for permission. The rules around self-isolation will also change, meaning that fully-vaccinated adults who are identified as a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to isolate if they return a negative PCR test. The use of face coverings will continue in secondary schools for the first part of the new term The government is still considering whether a certificate proving people have been vaccinated will be needed to enter ""higher-risk"" events. Ms Sturgeon confirmed that a ""Covid status certification"" app was under development, but said she was ""considering very carefully"" whether such a scheme would be appropriate. She also said she would not hesitate to take the ""tough decision"" to re-impose some local restrictions if there was a serious outbreak of the virus, saying the government ""will seek to take whatever action is necessary to keep the country safe"". While most restrictions will be lifted, a number of ""mitigations"" will remain in place, with Ms Sturgeon saying the harm of the virus ""cannot be underestimated"". The use of face coverings in enclosed spaces like shops, hospitality venues and public transport will remain ""for some time"" to come, and venues will still be expected to collect customer details for contact tracing. The first minister said it was ""vital"" that the return to working in offices was a gradual one, saying employers should consider a ""hybrid"" model of home and in-office work. Two weeks after restrictions were lifted in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance.

We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. That's why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. The move was broadly welcomed by business groups, although some still voiced fears about the economic recovery. The Federation of Small Businesses said firms would be ""elated"" that the bulk of curbs were being lifted, but trading conditions had been ""permanently changed by the crisis"". CBI Scotland said moving beyond level zero ""creates a much-needed platform for kickstarting Scotland's economic recovery"", but said firms would be ""confused"" about why ministers were still advising people to work from home. And the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said hundreds of pubs would now reopen for the first time, hailing this as ""fantastic news"" - adding that it was ""vital that we get the recovery phase right"". The changes will allow hospitality venues to increase capacity The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer recess for the announcement, giving opposition leaders the chance to question the first minister on the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the statement was a ""mixed bag"", saying that ""ongoing restrictions will hold Scotland's recovery back"". He said: ""We have moved beyond level zero - but still curbs remain in place. Yet again the goalposts have been moved. We are at level minus one or minus two, and still the government is clinging on to parts of people's lives."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there was ""definitely light at the end of the tunnel"", but said ""we are at a crucial point for Scotland's recovery"". He called for a ""new approach"" in the fight against the pandemic, calling for increased support for the test and trace system and pop-up vaccination clinics at sporting events and universities.

Scotland's growing sewage spill problemThe number of overspills into rivers and seas has risen by 40% in five years as pressure mounts on the sewer network.ScotlandComments,"The number of recorded sewage spills in Scotland's rivers and seas has increased by 40% over the last five years, new figures show. Scottish Water data shows the equivalent of 47,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of waste has been discharged since 2016. Campaigners are calling for more action to tackle the water waste issue. But Scottish Water has warned the problem will not be solved by ""building bigger and bigger sewers"". When there is heavy rain parts of the sewer network simply cannot cope. Sewage waste gathered at an overflow pipe that leads to the River Almond in West Lothian To stop sewage backing up into homes, the storm water and waste that would ordinarily go to Scottish Water treatment centres is released into seas or rivers through the 3,697 Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) dotted across the country. Many of these overflow pipes are close to popular beaches and wildlife habitats. But Scottish Water is only required to monitor less than 3% of these CSOs for pollution, so the true scale of how much water waste is discharged is unknown. The figures the utility firm does have show that last year there were a total of 12,725 ""spill events"" - up 40% on 2016. A breakdown of these recorded overspill events in Scottish Water's network, released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws, has been fed into thisinteractive dashboard,external. The dashboard also allows people to view a list of the number of spills, how long they lasted and how much was discharged by the part of the sewer network that is local to them. However, the actual volume of spills is likely to be far higher. This is because the list represents a fraction of the operating CSOs and there is no volume data provided in the FOI response for just over half of the spill events. The data also doesn't indicate which bodies of water are being polluted by each spill. The volume of recorded spills has also soared in the last five years, up from 12.9m cubic metres in 2016 to 48m cubic metres last year. A total of 119m cubic metres of waste water were discharged in the recorded overflow events during this period. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Sewer overflows seem to have been baked into the industry's thinking. ""Rather than being 'emergency release valves' during exceptional storms, they are potentially used as a means of almost continuous sewage discharge. ""The defunding of regulators, self-reporting of incidents, and loose and vague targets has led to the decimation of rivers and the renewed sewage struggle on our coastline. ""The time for tough new legislation and binding targets to end sewage pollution has come."" A total of 654 CSOs which do not have adequate screening to retain sewage debris are classified as unsatisfactory by Scottish Water. Some 192 of them have been in this state since before the creation of the publicly-owned firm in 2003. The most spills at a single location were in Helensburgh, which discharges into the Firth of Clyde. There have been an average of two spills a day over the last four years. The location with the highest recorded volume of spills was Shieldhall in Glasgow, with 17.7m cubic metres of waste water released there since 2016. Scottish Water has estimated that to upgrade all of these unsatisfactory overflow outlets would cost at least Â£650m. A couple stuck at a bus stop in Edinburgh during a July storm when parts of the city's sewer network were unable to cope with the rainfall Simon Parsons, a director with Scottish Water, said CSOs ""remain a vital relief mechanism to safely relieve the pressure on the sewer network"". He said the utility firm invests heavily in its 31,000 miles of waste water networks every year. But he added: ""It's not about building bigger and bigger sewers, that is not going to solve the problem."" Citing theimpact of climate change on the intensity of rainfall in Scotland, he continued: ""We have to stop that surface water getting into our systems. ""Last year was a wetter year than many we have had on record and it's not just the wetness over the year, it is the intensity of the storms that are coming into our sewers which is driving those spills that we are seeing."" Mr Parsons pointed out that people flushing items like wipes down toilets was still a major cause of many of the blockages that can lead to sewage spills. This video can not be played âThereâs raw sewage going into the riverâ - campaigners want action to tackle overspills When about half of the average July rainfall fell over West Lothian in the space of a few hours, the River Almond Action Group (RAAG) knew what was coming next. Campaigners are all too familiar with what comes out of the CSOs that discharge into the waterway after heavy rain. ""At the outlet there is raw sewage coming into the river,"" explains Ruth Plevin a member of RAAG. ""Everything you can imagine; plastic, tooth picks, toilet paper, wet wipes, all stuck on trees and looking like toilet tinsel. ""But we don't know what exactly is in the water because they don't tell us. ""On sunny days, the river is so appealing and people want to go in - why shouldn't they? Instead they are exposed to what is effectively an open sewer."" A section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park which is hoped will become designated bathing waters Veolia, which runs the East Calder wastewater treatment works under a PFI deal with Scottish Water, recently organised a clean-up that saw 65 bags of sewage debris removed from the river. But locals are pressing for a permanent solution for a river which had an average of 1.3 sewage discharges every day in 2019. The Forth Rivers Trust charity has applied for a section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park to become designated bathing waters. If successful it would be the first river in Scotland to join the 85 beaches with the same status, meaning stricter limits on sewage overspills and up-to-date water quality information available to the public. Huw Streater, of the Forth Rivers Trust, said: ""The Almond has suffered from serious pollution issues for a long time. ""Achieving bathing water status will help to make the Almond safer for the people who use it and the wildlife that we share it with. "" In the East Lothian village of Aberlady, resident Frank Neate has been recording evidence of what he says is waste water and sewage debris being discharged from CSOs into the village's bay during dry weather. Aberlady bay was the UK's first nature reserve and Frank is worried about the impact of the waste on its wildlife. Frank Neate, who used to work in the water industry, has been keeping track of the CSOs in the bay of the East Lothian village of Aberlady He said: ""I've told both Scottish Water and Sepa this shouldn't be happening during dry weather but nobody seems interested. ""What worries me is there are kids and dogs in and out of here and people don't know what's in the water - and this in a nature reserve of all places."" The job of ensuring Scottish Water complies with the laws and standards around the sewer network and overspills falls to environment agency Sepa. Prosecutions over sewage spills in Scotland are not common but Scottish Water was fined Â£19,000 last year forreleasing untreated sewage into the River Clyde in Glasgowin 2016.. Sepa says it focuses its enforcement effort on prosecutions relating to more systemic issues and ""significant progress"" has been made in raising standards over the past 20 years ""through targeted regulation and partnership work"". When raw sewage escaped into the River Clyde in 2016 after a pumping station failure, the smell was so bad locals were unable to open windows and had to wash soft furnishings to get rid of the odour But Sepa figures show that in 2018 only 111 of the 345 Scottish Water sewer licences, which set the overflow conditions, were assessed for compliance. Ten of the 111 licences inspected were found to be unsatisfactory, with the rest compliant. The licences do not require permanent spill monitors to be installed on all of the CSOs. A Sepa spokesman said: ""We assess sewer network licenses on a rolling basis, with particular focus on those which have unsatisfactory compliance, as these can discharge sewage litter and impact on people's enjoyment of the environment."" The spokesman said an increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall meant there ""is a risk that the number of unsatisfactory sewer overflows may progressively increase"". And he added that a ""radical new approach to managing rainfall"" was needed to reduce flood risk and minimise sewer overflow spills.

"Drug deaths at highest level since 1993In total, 4,561 deaths related to drug poisoning were registered in England and Wales last year.","The number of drug-related deaths recorded in England and Wales in 2020 was the highest since records began in 1993. In total, 4,561 deaths related to drug poisoning were registered - equivalent to a rate of 79.5 per million people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said about half of these would have occurred in 2019, because of delays in registering deaths. The majority will have occurred before the pandemic, it added. The latest figures, which are published annually,external, show stark differences between men and women, and among different regions. There were more than twice as many deaths among men as there were among women. The highest rate of deaths relating to drug misuse was in the North East of England, where 104.6 deaths were recorded per million people, and the lowest was in London, where that figure was 33.1. The DJ helping stop weird, wired cocaine weekends Review urges extra Â£552m for drug user treatments In terms of age, the highest rate was among people aged 45-49. The total death toll is 3.8% higher than the figure for 2019, when 4,393 deaths were recorded. The ONS suggested the increase could possibly be down to an ageing cohort of drug users suffering from the effects of long-term use, as well as new trends in taking certain drugs - including gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines - at the same time as heroin or morphine. Of the total deaths registered in 2020, 2,263 - around half - involved an opiate. And 777 of the deaths involved cocaine - a rise of about 10% on 2019, and more than quadruple the number recorded in 2010. Georgina Gorin, 35, started drinking heavily and taking drugs as a teenager. She didn't expect that years later she would lose her children and her home. She never thought she would be taking hard Class A drugs on the streets of Rochdale. And she couldn't have known that in the first Covid lockdown, bored and alone in an empty flat, her drinking addiction would spiral to another level. ""I knew that I was on the verge of death,"" she tells the BBC. ""I rang my mum up at midnight crying because I wanted to die."" She spent a month in a treatment centre and has been sober since last May. But it wasn't the first time she had sought help. She had attended sessions funded by the council on and off for years - and says they need more funding if they are to help those who need it most. ""Everything got cut. Even the one-to-ones went from an hour to half an hour, and then it went to once a month rather than every week. Things just weren't available when you needed them,"" she says. ""You go into the doctors and you say, 'I think I've got a problem', so they refer you - but the waiting list is months - you might be dead before then."" Now 15 months sober, Georgina volunteers with the charity Turning Point and is able to see her children again. ""It's just wonderful. Just for today I can say that I haven't got any problems,"" she laughs down the phone. ""It's just so nice to be able to be free and just know that today is a good day."" Last weekScotland, which records figures separately,reported that more than 1,300 people died of drug misuse last year - the highest figure for a seventh year running. The ONS figures come afteran independent review said spending cutshad left recovery services for drug addicts ""on their knees"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers would ""look closely"" at the recommendations from Dame Carol Black, who called for an extra Â£552m investment over five years in England. The government said it would set up a new cross-government unit on tackling drug misuse. Commenting on the ONS figures, Dr Emily Finch, vice-chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""Years of cuts have left addictions services ill-equipped to treat people and prevent these deaths from rising."" She added: ""The government needs to wake up to the fact that cuts to services, disconnecting NHS mental health services from addiction services and shifting the focus away from harm reduction to abstinence-based recovery is destroying lives and fuelling the increase in drug-related deaths."" Eytan Alexander, chief executive of the UK Addiction Treatment Group, said there was a ""parallel pandemic"" of drug, alcohol and mental health issues that had ""only worsened due to the virus"". Clare Taylor, national director of operations at Turning Point, said isolation, financial insecurity and fear during the pandemic ""has hit many of those who were already vulnerable including people with a history of drug or alcohol problems"". ""Every drug or alcohol related death is preventable, and our thoughts are with anyone who has lost someone this way,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""Any death due to drug misuse is a tragedy. To prevent people losing their lives to drug abuse we're launching a consultation today to improve access to naloxone. This will allow those working with addicts, including police, paramedics and prison officers, to administer the drug which helps reverse the effects of opioid overdose and save lives. ""We are already investing Â£148m to tackle the root causes of drug misuse including Â£80m for treatment and recovery -  the largest investment in the drug treatment system for 15 years.""

Scottish Water data shows the equivalent of 47,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of waste has been discharged since 2016. Campaigners are calling for more action to tackle the water waste issue. But Scottish Water has warned the problem will not be solved by ""building bigger and bigger sewers"". When there is heavy rain parts of the sewer network simply cannot cope. Sewage waste gathered at an overflow pipe that leads to the River Almond in West Lothian To stop sewage backing up into homes, the storm water and waste that would ordinarily go to Scottish Water treatment centres is released into seas or rivers through the 3,697 Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) dotted across the country. Many of these overflow pipes are close to popular beaches and wildlife habitats. But Scottish Water is only required to monitor less than 3% of these CSOs for pollution, so the true scale of how much water waste is discharged is unknown. The figures the utility firm does have show that last year there were a total of 12,725 ""spill events"" - up 40% on 2016. A breakdown of these recorded overspill events in Scottish Water's network, released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws, has been fed into thisinteractive dashboard,external. The dashboard also allows people to view a list of the number of spills, how long they lasted and how much was discharged by the part of the sewer network that is local to them. However, the actual volume of spills is likely to be far higher. This is because the list represents a fraction of the operating CSOs and there is no volume data provided in the FOI response for just over half of the spill events. The data also doesn't indicate which bodies of water are being polluted by each spill. The volume of recorded spills has also soared in the last five years, up from 12.9m cubic metres in 2016 to 48m cubic metres last year. A total of 119m cubic metres of waste water were discharged in the recorded overflow events during this period. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Sewer overflows seem to have been baked into the industry's thinking. ""Rather than being 'emergency release valves' during exceptional storms, they are potentially used as a means of almost continuous sewage discharge. ""The defunding of regulators, self-reporting of incidents, and loose and vague targets has led to the decimation of rivers and the renewed sewage struggle on our coastline. ""The time for tough new legislation and binding targets to end sewage pollution has come."" A total of 654 CSOs which do not have adequate screening to retain sewage debris are classified as unsatisfactory by Scottish Water. Some 192 of them have been in this state since before the creation of the publicly-owned firm in 2003. The most spills at a single location were in Helensburgh, which discharges into the Firth of Clyde. There have been an average of two spills a day over the last four years. The location with the highest recorded volume of spills was Shieldhall in Glasgow, with 17.7m cubic metres of waste water released there since 2016. Scottish Water has estimated that to upgrade all of these unsatisfactory overflow outlets would cost at least Â£650m. A couple stuck at a bus stop in Edinburgh during a July storm when parts of the city's sewer network were unable to cope with the rainfall Simon Parsons, a director with Scottish Water, said CSOs ""remain a vital relief mechanism to safely relieve the pressure on the sewer network"". He said the utility firm invests heavily in its 31,000 miles of waste water networks every year. But he added: ""It's not about building bigger and bigger sewers, that is not going to solve the problem."" Citing theimpact of climate change on the intensity of rainfall in Scotland, he continued: ""We have to stop that surface water getting into our systems. ""Last year was a wetter year than many we have had on record and it's not just the wetness over the year, it is the intensity of the storms that are coming into our sewers which is driving those spills that we are seeing."" Mr Parsons pointed out that people flushing items like wipes down toilets was still a major cause of many of the blockages that can lead to sewage spills. This video can not be played âThereâs raw sewage going into the riverâ - campaigners want action to tackle overspills When about half of the average July rainfall fell over West Lothian in the space of a few hours, the River Almond Action Group (RAAG) knew what was coming next. Campaigners are all too familiar with what comes out of the CSOs that discharge into the waterway after heavy rain. ""At the outlet there is raw sewage coming into the river,"" explains Ruth Plevin a member of RAAG. ""Everything you can imagine; plastic, tooth picks, toilet paper, wet wipes, all stuck on trees and looking like toilet tinsel. ""But we don't know what exactly is in the water because they don't tell us. ""On sunny days, the river is so appealing and people want to go in - why shouldn't they? Instead they are exposed to what is effectively an open sewer."" A section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park which is hoped will become designated bathing waters Veolia, which runs the East Calder wastewater treatment works under a PFI deal with Scottish Water, recently organised a clean-up that saw 65 bags of sewage debris removed from the river. But locals are pressing for a permanent solution for a river which had an average of 1.3 sewage discharges every day in 2019. The Forth Rivers Trust charity has applied for a section of the River Almond in Almondell and Calderwood Country Park to become designated bathing waters. If successful it would be the first river in Scotland to join the 85 beaches with the same status, meaning stricter limits on sewage overspills and up-to-date water quality information available to the public. Huw Streater, of the Forth Rivers Trust, said: ""The Almond has suffered from serious pollution issues for a long time. ""Achieving bathing water status will help to make the Almond safer for the people who use it and the wildlife that we share it with. "" In the East Lothian village of Aberlady, resident Frank Neate has been recording evidence of what he says is waste water and sewage debris being discharged from CSOs into the village's bay during dry weather. Aberlady bay was the UK's first nature reserve and Frank is worried about the impact of the waste on its wildlife. Frank Neate, who used to work in the water industry, has been keeping track of the CSOs in the bay of the East Lothian village of Aberlady He said: ""I've told both Scottish Water and Sepa this shouldn't be happening during dry weather but nobody seems interested. ""What worries me is there are kids and dogs in and out of here and people don't know what's in the water - and this in a nature reserve of all places."" The job of ensuring Scottish Water complies with the laws and standards around the sewer network and overspills falls to environment agency Sepa. Prosecutions over sewage spills in Scotland are not common but Scottish Water was fined Â£19,000 last year forreleasing untreated sewage into the River Clyde in Glasgowin 2016.. Sepa says it focuses its enforcement effort on prosecutions relating to more systemic issues and ""significant progress"" has been made in raising standards over the past 20 years ""through targeted regulation and partnership work"". When raw sewage escaped into the River Clyde in 2016 after a pumping station failure, the smell was so bad locals were unable to open windows and had to wash soft furnishings to get rid of the odour But Sepa figures show that in 2018 only 111 of the 345 Scottish Water sewer licences, which set the overflow conditions, were assessed for compliance. Ten of the 111 licences inspected were found to be unsatisfactory, with the rest compliant. The licences do not require permanent spill monitors to be installed on all of the CSOs. A Sepa spokesman said: ""We assess sewer network licenses on a rolling basis, with particular focus on those which have unsatisfactory compliance, as these can discharge sewage litter and impact on people's enjoyment of the environment."" The spokesman said an increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall meant there ""is a risk that the number of unsatisfactory sewer overflows may progressively increase"". And he added that a ""radical new approach to managing rainfall"" was needed to reduce flood risk and minimise sewer overflow spills.

'Flexible' votes in shops and schools proposed,"Currently your polling station is assigned according to where your live - but could this change? People could be allowed to vote in supermarkets or schools in some parts of Wales at next year's council elections. New ""flexible voting"" proposals could see polling take place over multiple days or a weekend before an election, in an effort to boost turnout. The Welsh government has asked if councils would like to pilot the ideas. But a body of electoral officials said there was not a ""huge"" amount of time to implement the proposals. The Welsh Conservatives said some might see the proposals as an effort to ""gerrymander"" the elections, while Plaid Cymru welcomed the plans. Turnout in Wales was 42% at the last council elections in 2017. Next year's elections will be the first for local government in Wales where 16 and 17-year-olds can take part. Long queues as polls close for Welsh elections At least 35,000 young Welsh voters not registered 'I always vote - this year I didn't' Officials are considering letting voters cast ballots in any polling station in their local authority area. It could mean people could vote in person somewhere more convenient to them, instead of the polling station allocated according to where they live. The Welsh government is looking at whether voting in places like supermarkets and leisure centres could be allowed, or in schools and colleges. Early voting - as seenin the US elections last November- could also form part of the pilots. An experiment was held with supermarket voting in Croydon in 1998 Polling station staff generally have paper lists of electors to check off when people arrive to vote, but the Welsh government says ""digital solutions"" would be required for some of the ideas. Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said the announcement had ""some really good ideas in it"". ""It is key that electors can only vote once, and they vote in the right polls,"" she said. ""But it's a very large administrative challenge, because while it might not seem too much of a radical idea, we do need to make some big changes to enable this"". Ms Lock also called for the Welsh government to make decisions as ""early as possible"", with the elections happening on 5 May. ""We want to embrace all of the possibilities that the pilots will bring us but nine months doesn't give a huge amount of time to ensure that that can be done. ""I think it will be a challenge. But I don't think that it's impossible."" This video can not be played ""I couldn't wait two-and-a-half hours to cast my vote"" The Welsh government's senior legal advisor, Counsel General Mick Antoniw, said the administration wanted to make it as easy as possible to vote. ""Democracy should be a part of all our lives and if more of us take part, it will lead to better policy making by elected representatives and policies which truly represent the views and experiences of all of us,"" he said. ""These voting pilots will help us to better understand how we can increase turnout. We believe making voting more flexible and easier will bring democracy closer to everyone."" But Welsh Conservative constitution spokesman Darren Millar said: ""The people of Wales already have the chance to vote early and from home via the use of a postal vote, we don't need major changes to a system that already serves our democracy well. ""Some may see this a desperate attempt by Labour ministers to gerrymander the voting system."" Plaid Cymru's spokesman for the constitution Rhys ab Owen said: ""Any attempts to boost voter turnout are greatly welcomed and long overdue."" ""This must go hand in hand with wider electoral reform including greater political education in schools and a fairer voting system in the form ofSTV,external. A healthy democracy relies on both an engaged electorate and accessible elections."" The 2021 Senedd election was the first in Wales where 16 and 17-year-olds could take part. But tens of thousands did not register in time to do so, with figures suggesting54% failed to register. The UK government experimented with voting in supermarkets back in the 1990s, when polling stations were opened at two shops for the 1998 council elections and London mayoralty referendum. Supermarket car parks also saw useas polling stations in England last May,external, according to the Local Government Chronicle.

Sunak warns young home working may hurt career,"Young people will see their careers benefit by working in the office, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said. He told LinkedIn News he doubted he would have done as well if he had started his working life virtually. Mr Sunak worked in finance, including at banking giant Goldman Sachs. He said he still talked to his early mentors, saying: ""I doubt I would have had those strong relationships if I was doing my summer internship or my first bit of my career over Teams and Zoom."" ""That's why I think for young people in particular, being able to physically be in an office is valuable,"" he added. The government has recommended a gradual return to work in England since restrictions were lifted on 19 July. However, the Scottish government wants people to keep working at home until at least 9 August, where possible. Should I be working at home or going to the office?

LiveLiveSturgeon to set out changes to Scotland's Covid rules5 minutes ago,"The UK reports another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest since late June Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon confirms Social distancing will be dropped in most settings but a number of mitigation measures will remain in place It means more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts Meanwhile, a proposal to create an ""amber watchlist"" of travel destinations has been abandoned by the UK government It would have warned people when a country was at risk of a sudden shift to the more-restricted red list Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the air travel industry body Airlines UK, says it is a ""victory for common sense"" Deaths in the UK mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate rose by 46% in the week to 23 July, the Office for National Statistics says Qantas says it will stand down 2,500 staff as a lockdown in Sydney impacts air travel across Australia Authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan will begin testing its entire population, after some coronavirus cases were found Edited by Emma Owen Goodbye and thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates. As ever, any major developments will be covered on our main pages,here. Today's posts were written by Alexandra Fouche, Emma Harrison, Becky Morton and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke and Emma Owen. China is currently seeing one of its biggest Covid outbreaks in months And here is a round-up of what's been going on around the world: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly so here's a recap of the main developments in the UK today: Adam FlemingChief political correspondent For five days the government mulled the idea of an ""amber watchlist"" to warn travellers that the country they intended to visit could imminently turn from amber to red on the traffic light system for international travel. That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday.

have today been arriving at one of its 550 vaccination centres to receive their jabs as a nationwide campaign begins. The country, which is facing a third wave
of the pandemic, has received a million doses of the single-jab Johnson
& Johnson vaccine from the US under the Covax scheme. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who got her injection last week, said Tanzania has placed another order for the vaccine
through the African Union as part of its plan to initially target more
than 60% of the population. The start of this  campaign comes at a
time when public opinion is divided over the safety of the vaccines. The president, who has shifted the country away from the Covid scepticism of her predecessor, has urged Tanzania to come out and get the jab. The country was one of the last on the continent to receive any vaccines. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is nowurging people not to travel unless necessary,,externalafter an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Nanjing has spread to other
cities. Cases of Covid-19 were first identified among workers at an
international airport in Nanjing on 20 July. Since then, official media have
confirmed cases have been detected in 15 provincial-level regions,
many of which are the Delta variant. There are 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. Cases linked to Nanjing have been identified in major
cities such as Chengdu and Beijing, and have led to local lockdowns. New caseshave now been detected in the city of Wuhan,the original Covid-19 epicentre,
for the first time since June 2020. There are also cases in Zhengzhou, a city that has experienced devastating
floods in recent weeks. China has not seen a widespread outbreak like this since
the beginning of the year, when an outbreak in the north-east city of
Shijiazhuang spread to multiple eastern provinces. The official Nanjing Daily has today confirmed a special quarantine base
with 2,000 roomswill now be built to treat patients in the city.,external Transport links in and out of Nanjing have largely been
suspended, and residents are currently undergoing a fourth round of Covid-19
tests. Nanjing has a population of 9.2 million people. Morocco is introducing new coronavirus restrictions, including a night curfew, as infection rates rise. The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK. Some 73% of the UKâs adult population is now fully vaccinated,according to the latest government figures.,external More than 38.5 million people have received two doses of a Covid vaccine

million people have had a first jab â 88.7% of the UK adult population. The UK has reported another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest
since late June. The last time case numbers were lower was on 29 June, when 20,479 were reported. There were also a further 138 deaths recorded within 28 days
of a positive test, which is the highest since 17 March.

He has been unable to return to work because of the persistent brain fog, which causes him to lose track in the middle of sentences and makes it hard to process large amounts of information. He is one of a number of patients who will be taking part in a long-term study of the illness. Jason Lim struggles with ordinary tasks due to the brain fog caused by long Covid. Reality Check The US has now given one dose of vaccine to 70% of all adults,externalâ a target originally set for 4 July by President Joe Biden. After being one of the top nations for its vaccine rollout
earlier in the year, the US is now behind neighbouring Canada in terms of doses
administered as a share of population. And itâs also behind the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies, such as Japan, but
the US vaccination rate has dropped off more significantly than in other
developed countries. In the middle of April, the US was giving out more than three
million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this
is a slight increase on mid-July levels. BBC Reality Check has looked into where
vaccinations are lagging in the US, and why,here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story. Guidance for universities and colleges in Scotland on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms.

Spain welcomed 10 times more tourists in June than in the same month last year at the height of the pandemic. Some 2.2 million tourists entered Spain in June this year, nearly a quarter of them from Germany,the country's official statistical agency, INE, said,external. But the total is still only a quarter of the visitors before the coronavirus crisis. Spain's economy contracted sharply by 10.8% in 2020, one of the worst results in the eurozone, the AFP news agency reports.But it is now forecast to grow again this year,external. Here's a recap of the changes Nicola Sturgeon has just announced for Scotland from 9 August:  Read further detail on the changes in our story here.  Ms Sturgeon urges the public to ""continue to be careful, cautious, and sensible even as legal
restrictions are lifted"". ""We all hope that the restrictions we lift next Monday will
never have to be reimposed, but no one can guarantee that,"" she says. In winter the virus âmay well pose challenges for us againâ. She urges people to get the vaccine, test regularly and stick to the rules that remain in place, such as on face coverings. Meet outdoors as much as possible, she says, and ventilate the space if you are meeting indoors. Even if it is no longer legally mandated these measures are ""still
sensible precautionsâ, she says. Secondary school pupils will need to keep wearing masks for at least the first six weeks of the new term Nicola Sturgeon now sets out changes to guidance for schools. She says blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine and instead there will be a more targeted approach, with fewer young people asked to self-isolate. However, most other mitigations will remain for the first six weeks of the new academic term, the first minister says. This includes one metre social distancing between staff and pupils and face coverings for staff and children aged 12 and over. Sturgeon says these measures will be kept under review. All secondary pupils and staff will also be asked to take a lateral flow test before
returning after the holidays and twice a week after that. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Fears for global security as Taliban battles rage,"Afghan forces are battling the Taliban in Lashkar Gah Residents of a besieged Afghan city have been urged to evacuate ahead of an army operation against the Taliban. General Sami Sadat, who is leading the battle against the Taliban in the southern province of Helmand, called on people to leave its capital Lashkar Gah as soon as possible. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day amid intense fighting, the UN says. The Taliban are reported to have captured most of the city. But the fighting is continuing and government forces have vowed not to let it fall into militant hands. In a message to residents of the city, Gen Sadat said the army would ""not leave a single Taliban alive"". ""I know it is very difficult for you to leave your houses - it is hard for us too - but if you are displaced for a few days please forgive us,"" he said. Gen Sadat earlier told the BBC that while government forces had lost ground, he believed the Taliban would be unable to sustain their assault. The Taliban assault in Helmand province is part of a major offensive across Afghanistan. The militants have made rapid advancesin recent months as US forces have withdrawn after 20 years of military operations in the country. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign, and any Taliban gains there would be a blow for the Afghan government. If Lashkar Gah fell, it would be the first provincial capital won by the Taliban since 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. Residents of Lashkar Gah say they are living in fear as the city faces heavy assault from the militants, who are being targeted with US and Afghan air strikes. ""Neither the Taliban will have mercy on us nor will the government stop the bombing. There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" one resident told the BBC. Another said: ""I do not know where to go, there are clashes in every corner of the city."" Who are the Taliban? How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) says civilians are ""bearing the brunt"" of the fighting, with the Taliban ground offensive and Afghan air strikes causing the most harm. It has called on both sides to do more to protect civilians, including an immediate end to fighting in urban areas. In addition to the fatalities, dozens of people have been injured and thousands displaced, according to Unama. Doctors in Lashkar Gah say they are overwhelmed and running low on supplies. ""There is fighting all around,"" one told the BBC. An Afghan interpreter living in the city said his life was under threat from the Taliban because he had worked for the British forces. ""My own house which I left yesterday has been captured by the Taliban and they are living there and they were asking for me,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen in the future but they are looking from house to house to find the people who worked for Nato."" Gen Sadat told the BBC the Taliban were being supported by fighters from other Islamist groups and warned that their gains posed a threat beyond Afghanistan. ""This will increase the hope for small extremist groups to mobilise in the cities of Europe and America, and will have a devastating effect on global security,"" he said. ""This is not a war of Afghanistan, this is a war between liberty and totalitarianism."" Lashkar Gah is one of three provincial capitals under attack. Attempts by the militants to captureKandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, have continued after rocket strikes hit its airport on Sunday. Seizing control of Kandahar would be a huge victory for the Taliban, giving them a grip on the south of the country. Unama says five civilians have been killed and 42 wounded over the past three days. In a third besieged city,Herat, in the west, government commandos are battling the insurgents after days of fierce fighting. Government forces have taken back some areas after a UN compound was attacked on Friday. Videos shared on social media appeared to show residents on the streets and rooftops of Herat shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") in support of the government's gains. As government forces struggled to contain Taliban advances, President Ashraf Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of US troops for the increase in fighting. ""The reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly,"" he told parliament on Monday. Mr Ghani said he had warned Washington that the withdrawal would have ""consequences"". Although nearly all its military forces have left, the US has continued its air offensive in support of government troops. President Biden's administration announced on Monday that because of the increase in violence, it wouldtake in thousands more Afghan refugees who worked with US forces.

Fears for global security as Taliban battles rageAfghan general warns of consequences if the Taliban win their fight against government forces.Asia,"Afghan forces are battling the Taliban in Lashkar Gah Residents of a besieged Afghan city have been urged to evacuate ahead of an army operation against the Taliban. General Sami Sadat, who is leading the battle against the Taliban in the southern province of Helmand, called on people to leave its capital Lashkar Gah as soon as possible. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day amid intense fighting, the UN says. The Taliban are reported to have captured most of the city. But the fighting is continuing and government forces have vowed not to let it fall into militant hands.

"Gangs on e-scooters targeting GPS farm equipmentTotal theft claims fall after the pandemic but technology stays a draw for criminals, says insurer.","Gangs are using e-scooters to sneak on to UK farms and steal high-value GPS technology, an insurer has said. NFU Mutual said the cost of replacing the stolen equipment that forms an ""essential part of modern farming"" nearly doubled in a year to Â£2.9m. ""Highly-organised criminals continued to plague farmyards,"" with quad bikes also being targeted, the firm said. But it says the overall number of theft claims in 2020 fell by 20% to Â£43.3m, amid the coronavirus lockdowns. Global positioning systems (GPS) equipment on tractors can cost up to Â£10,000 a piece. It helps farmers map their acreage and make the most efficient use of their land. The technology is ""in demand across the globe"" and has become the ""rural thieves' top target"", the insurer said. ""Without GPS... harvests can be delayed and farmers are left unable to work,"" said Rebecca Davidson, rural affairs specialist with NFU Mutual. Bodycams for farmers as they fight rural crime Crime makes farmers 'feel like sitting ducks' Det Con Chris Piggott, from the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, said: ""The pattern we are increasingly seeing is of gangs who patiently watch farms from a distance to discover where expensive tractor GPS kit is stored. ""They generally return at night to steal, and are now using silent electric scooters to get into farmyards undetected and make off at high speed."" He added: ""Thieves are also becoming even slicker stealing quad bikes - watching for hours to rush into farm yards and steal them when they are left unattended for a few minutes."" The total cost of the insurer's claims for the theft of GPS, quad bikes and other all-terrain vehicles amounted to more than Â£9m last year, a drop of only 2% on 2019. NFU Mutual'sannual rural crime report,externalsays the overall cost of theft in the UK countryside fell in 2020 because of the lockdown, the existence of more police rural crime teams, and increased farm security. Wales and Northern Ireland both saw the largest falls, down 39.4% and 36.9% respectively, while Scotland saw a 25% decrease. In regions of England the level of the falls in theft claims varied - ranging from a 9.7% dip in the North East to a 25.3% decrease in the Midlands. The only area to see a rise was the North West, where the cost of claims were up 3.3%. The thefts of livestock was down by about a quarter. But the value of sheep and cattle attacked by dogs rose in 2020 following a surge in pet ownership during the pandemic and visits to the countryside, NFU Mutual said. Other trends highlighted by NFU Mutual included fly-tipping in fields and country lanes, which was said to have reached ""epidemic proportions"". Meanwhile, cybercrime affecting farmers is said to be a growing danger, with phishing emails about farm payments and scam adverts for agricultural machinery. NFU Mutual, which insures about three-quarters of all UK farmers, says it is investing Â£430,000 in rural security schemes in 2021.

"Drug deaths at highest level since 1993In total, 4,561 deaths related to drug poisoning were registered in England and Wales last year.UK","The number of drug-related deaths recorded in England and Wales in 2020 was the highest since records began in 1993. In total, 4,561 deaths related to drug poisoning were registered - equivalent to a rate of 79.5 per million people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said about half of these would have occurred in 2019, because of delays in registering deaths. The majority will have occurred before the pandemic, it added. The latest figures, which are published annually,external, show stark differences between men and women, and among different regions. There were more than twice as many deaths among men as there were among women. The highest rate of deaths relating to drug misuse was in the North East of England, where 104.6 deaths were recorded per million people, and the lowest was in London, where that figure was 33.1. The DJ helping stop weird, wired cocaine weekends Review urges extra Â£552m for drug user treatments In terms of age, the highest rate was among people aged 45-49. The total death toll is 3.8% higher than the figure for 2019, when 4,393 deaths were recorded. The ONS suggested the increase could possibly be down to an ageing cohort of drug users suffering from the effects of long-term use, as well as new trends in taking certain drugs - including gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines - at the same time as heroin or morphine. Of the total deaths registered in 2020, 2,263 - around half - involved an opiate. And 777 of the deaths involved cocaine - a rise of about 10% on 2019, and more than quadruple the number recorded in 2010. Georgina Gorin, 35, started drinking heavily and taking drugs as a teenager. She didn't expect that years later she would lose her children and her home. She never thought she would be taking hard Class A drugs on the streets of Rochdale. And she couldn't have known that in the first Covid lockdown, bored and alone in an empty flat, her drinking addiction would spiral to another level. ""I knew that I was on the verge of death,"" she tells the BBC. ""I rang my mum up at midnight crying because I wanted to die."" She spent a month in a treatment centre and has been sober since last May. But it wasn't the first time she had sought help. She had attended sessions funded by the council on and off for years - and says they need more funding if they are to help those who need it most. ""Everything got cut. Even the one-to-ones went from an hour to half an hour, and then it went to once a month rather than every week. Things just weren't available when you needed them,"" she says. ""You go into the doctors and you say, 'I think I've got a problem', so they refer you - but the waiting list is months - you might be dead before then."" Now 15 months sober, Georgina volunteers with the charity Turning Point and is able to see her children again. ""It's just wonderful. Just for today I can say that I haven't got any problems,"" she laughs down the phone. ""It's just so nice to be able to be free and just know that today is a good day."" Last weekScotland, which records figures separately,reported that more than 1,300 people died of drug misuse last year - the highest figure for a seventh year running. The ONS figures come afteran independent review said spending cutshad left recovery services for drug addicts ""on their knees"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers would ""look closely"" at the recommendations from Dame Carol Black, who called for an extra Â£552m investment over five years in England. The government said it would set up a new cross-government unit on tackling drug misuse. Commenting on the ONS figures, Dr Emily Finch, vice-chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""Years of cuts have left addictions services ill-equipped to treat people and prevent these deaths from rising."" She added: ""The government needs to wake up to the fact that cuts to services, disconnecting NHS mental health services from addiction services and shifting the focus away from harm reduction to abstinence-based recovery is destroying lives and fuelling the increase in drug-related deaths."" Eytan Alexander, chief executive of the UK Addiction Treatment Group, said there was a ""parallel pandemic"" of drug, alcohol and mental health issues that had ""only worsened due to the virus"". Clare Taylor, national director of operations at Turning Point, said isolation, financial insecurity and fear during the pandemic ""has hit many of those who were already vulnerable including people with a history of drug or alcohol problems"". ""Every drug or alcohol related death is preventable, and our thoughts are with anyone who has lost someone this way,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""Any death due to drug misuse is a tragedy. To prevent people losing their lives to drug abuse we're launching a consultation today to improve access to naloxone. This will allow those working with addicts, including police, paramedics and prison officers, to administer the drug which helps reverse the effects of opioid overdose and save lives. ""We are already investing Â£148m to tackle the root causes of drug misuse including Â£80m for treatment and recovery -  the largest investment in the drug treatment system for 15 years.""

We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates. As ever, any major developments will be covered on our main pages,here. Today's posts were written by Alexandra Fouche, Emma Harrison, Becky Morton and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke and Emma Owen. China is currently seeing one of its biggest Covid outbreaks in months And here is a round-up of what's been going on around the world: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly so here's a recap of the main developments in the UK today: Adam FlemingChief political correspondent For five days the government mulled the idea of an ""amber watchlist"" to warn travellers that the country they intended to visit could imminently turn from amber to red on the traffic light system for international travel. That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday.

have today been arriving at one of its 550 vaccination centres to receive their jabs as a nationwide campaign begins. The country, which is facing a third wave
of the pandemic, has received a million doses of the single-jab Johnson
& Johnson vaccine from the US under the Covax scheme. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who got her injection last week, said Tanzania has placed another order for the vaccine
through the African Union as part of its plan to initially target more
than 60% of the population. The start of this  campaign comes at a
time when public opinion is divided over the safety of the vaccines. The president, who has shifted the country away from the Covid scepticism of her predecessor, has urged Tanzania to come out and get the jab. The country was one of the last on the continent to receive any vaccines.

The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK. Some 73% of the UKâs adult population is now fully vaccinated,according to the latest government figures.,external More than 38.5 million people have received two doses of a Covid vaccine
â up 126,307 from the previous day. Another 26,114 received a first dose of a vaccine, meaning 46.9
million people have had a first jab â 88.7% of the UK adult population. The UK has reported another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest
since late June. The last time case numbers were lower was on 29 June, when 20,479 were reported. There were also a further 138 deaths recorded within 28 days
of a positive test, which is the highest since 17 March.

He has been unable to return to work because of the persistent brain fog, which causes him to lose track in the middle of sentences and makes it hard to process large amounts of information. He is one of a number of patients who will be taking part in a long-term study of the illness. Jason Lim struggles with ordinary tasks due to the brain fog caused by long Covid. Reality Check The US has now given one dose of vaccine to 70% of all adults,externalâ a target originally set for 4 July by President Joe Biden. After being one of the top nations for its vaccine rollout
earlier in the year, the US is now behind neighbouring Canada in terms of doses
administered as a share of population. And itâs also behind the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies, such as Japan, but
the US vaccination rate has dropped off more significantly than in other
developed countries. In the middle of April, the US was giving out more than three
million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this
is a slight increase on mid-July levels. BBC Reality Check has looked into where
vaccinations are lagging in the US, and why,here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story. Guidance for universities and colleges in Scotland on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms. Students will be asked to take a PCR test before moving to student accommodation and then asked to test twice a week thereafter.

Spain welcomed 10 times more tourists in June than in the same month last year at the height of the pandemic. Some 2.2 million tourists entered Spain in June this year, nearly a quarter of them from Germany,the country's official statistical agency, INE, said,external. But the total is still only a quarter of the visitors before the coronavirus crisis. Spain's economy contracted sharply by 10.8% in 2020, one of the worst results in the eurozone, the AFP news agency reports.But it is now forecast to grow again this year,external. Here's a recap of the changes Nicola Sturgeon has just announced for Scotland from 9 August:  Read further detail on the changes in our story here.  Ms Sturgeon urges the public to ""continue to be careful, cautious, and sensible even as legal
restrictions are lifted"". ""We all hope that the restrictions we lift next Monday will
never have to be reimposed, but no one can guarantee that,"" she says. In winter the virus âmay well pose challenges for us againâ. She urges people to get the vaccine, test regularly and stick to the rules that remain in place, such as on face coverings. Meet outdoors as much as possible, she says, and ventilate the space if you are meeting indoors. Even if it is no longer legally mandated these measures are ""still
sensible precautionsâ, she says. Secondary school pupils will need to keep wearing masks for at least the first six weeks of the new term Nicola Sturgeon now sets out changes to guidance for schools. She says blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine and instead there will be a more targeted approach, with fewer young people asked to self-isolate. However, most other mitigations will remain for the first six weeks of the new academic term, the first minister says. This includes one metre social distancing between staff and pupils and face coverings for staff and children aged 12 and over. Sturgeon says these measures will be kept under review. All secondary pupils and staff will also be asked to take a lateral flow test before
returning after the holidays and twice a week after that. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"'Flexible' votes in shops and schools proposedCould voting with your weekly shop boost turnout at next year's council elections?Wales politicsCommentsMan charged with murder of girl at holiday parkA 15-year-old girl died following a ""domestic disturbance"" at a holiday park on Saturday.Wales","Currently your polling station is assigned according to where your live - but could this change? People could be allowed to vote in supermarkets or schools in some parts of Wales at next year's council elections. New ""flexible voting"" proposals could see polling take place over multiple days or a weekend before an election, in an effort to boost turnout. The Welsh government has asked if councils would like to pilot the ideas. But a body of electoral officials said there was not a ""huge"" amount of time to implement the proposals. The Welsh Conservatives said some might see the proposals as an effort to ""gerrymander"" the elections, while Plaid Cymru welcomed the plans. Turnout in Wales was 42% at the last council elections in 2017. Next year's elections will be the first for local government in Wales where 16 and 17-year-olds can take part. Long queues as polls close for Welsh elections At least 35,000 young Welsh voters not registered 'I always vote - this year I didn't' Officials are considering letting voters cast ballots in any polling station in their local authority area. It could mean people could vote in person somewhere more convenient to them, instead of the polling station allocated according to where they live. The Welsh government is looking at whether voting in places like supermarkets and leisure centres could be allowed, or in schools and colleges. Early voting - as seenin the US elections last November- could also form part of the pilots. An experiment was held with supermarket voting in Croydon in 1998 Polling station staff generally have paper lists of electors to check off when people arrive to vote, but the Welsh government says ""digital solutions"" would be required for some of the ideas. Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said the announcement had ""some really good ideas in it"". ""It is key that electors can only vote once, and they vote in the right polls,"" she said. ""But it's a very large administrative challenge, because while it might not seem too much of a radical idea, we do need to make some big changes to enable this"". Ms Lock also called for the Welsh government to make decisions as ""early as possible"", with the elections happening on 5 May. ""We want to embrace all of the possibilities that the pilots will bring us but nine months doesn't give a huge amount of time to ensure that that can be done. ""I think it will be a challenge. But I don't think that it's impossible."" This video can not be played ""I couldn't wait two-and-a-half hours to cast my vote"" The Welsh government's senior legal advisor, Counsel General Mick Antoniw, said the administration wanted to make it as easy as possible to vote. ""Democracy should be a part of all our lives and if more of us take part, it will lead to better policy making by elected representatives and policies which truly represent the views and experiences of all of us,"" he said. ""These voting pilots will help us to better understand how we can increase turnout. We believe making voting more flexible and easier will bring democracy closer to everyone."" But Welsh Conservative constitution spokesman Darren Millar said: ""The people of Wales already have the chance to vote early and from home via the use of a postal vote, we don't need major changes to a system that already serves our democracy well. ""Some may see this a desperate attempt by Labour ministers to gerrymander the voting system."" Plaid Cymru's spokesman for the constitution Rhys ab Owen said: ""Any attempts to boost voter turnout are greatly welcomed and long overdue."" ""This must go hand in hand with wider electoral reform including greater political education in schools and a fairer voting system in the form ofSTV,external. A healthy democracy relies on both an engaged electorate and accessible elections."" The 2021 Senedd election was the first in Wales where 16 and 17-year-olds could take part. But tens of thousands did not register in time to do so, with figures suggesting54% failed to register. The UK government experimented with voting in supermarkets back in the 1990s, when polling stations were opened at two shops for the 1998 council elections and London mayoralty referendum. Supermarket car parks also saw useas polling stations in England last May,external, according to the Local Government Chronicle.

Greggs to create 500 jobs as it opens more stores,"Bakery chain Greggs has said it expects to create 500 new retail jobs in the coming months as it continues to open new outlets. The new jobs come as part of the chain's plans to open about 100 net new stores by the end of the year. Greggs swung back to profit during the first half of the year as its sales rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. The stronger-than-expected sales mean it now expects full-year profits to be ""slightly ahead"" of previous forecasts. Greggs reported profits of Â£55.5m for six months to 3 July, compared with a Â£65.2m loss a year earlier.. The chain said the recovery in trade in recent months had been ""stronger than we had anticipated"", helped by the easing of Covid restrictions. The lifting of restrictions ""made a significant difference to footfall"", it said, with sales in the second quarter up 2.8% compared with the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. However, Greggs saw a mixed performance from its stores. It said its shops in public transport hubs and large city centres were among its weaker performing outlets, suggesting that many workers have yet to return to the office. In contrast, ""customers staying closer to home are supporting our heartland shops in suburban and High Street areas"". ""The strongest locations continue to be shops typically accessed by car,"" it added. Greggs is looking at even more ambitious growth plans as it said it had ""the opportunity to expand its UK estate to at least 3,000 shops"". Empty shop numbers rise as Covid continues to bite The experiences replacing closed High Street stores It had 2,115 locations at the start of July. ""Greggs once again showed its resilience in a challenging first half, emerging from the lockdown months in a strong position and rebuilding sales as social restrictions were progressively relaxed,"" said boss Roger Whiteside. The group has also targeted growth areas such as delivery and drive-thru sales. ""Greggs' results reflect its underlying strength as a business,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. ""The company is feeling the full effect of a 'return to normal' along with the benefits of its investment in digital and the adaptations made to its estate to accommodate new customer habits during lockdown."" The chain needs another vegan sausage roll success, reckons Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""Now that workplaces are opening and staff are returning to city centres, Greggs cannot afford to let up the pace,"" she said. ""It has already started playing up the passion that its customers have for its food, but if it hopes to get back to the heights of giving out bonuses to its staff then it needs restrictions permanently eased, pandemic contingency plans in place and, almost inevitably, another vegan sausage roll of a PR campaign."" Greggs launched a new vegan sausage, bean and cheese melt launched last week. ""That is likely to bring a little extra sauce to sales in the coming months,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown.

"Return to the office would help young, says Sunak","Young people will see their careers benefit by working in the office, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said. He told LinkedIn News he doubted he would have done as well if he had started his working life virtually. Mr Sunak worked in finance, including at banking giant Goldman Sachs. He said he still talked to his early mentors, saying: ""I doubt I would have had those strong relationships if I was doing my summer internship or my first bit of my career over Teams and Zoom."" ""That's why I think for young people in particular, being able to physically be in an office is valuable,"" he added.

Fears for global security as Taliban battles rageAn Afghan general warns of devastating consequences if the Taliban win their fight against government forces.AsiaRelated contentHow the Taliban retook half of AfghanistanVideoAfghan orphan's reunion with British soldier after 19 yearsI was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US,"Afghan forces are battling the Taliban in Lashkar Gah Residents of a besieged Afghan city have been urged to evacuate ahead of an army operation against the Taliban. General Sami Sadat, who is leading the battle against the Taliban in the southern province of Helmand, called on people to leave its capital Lashkar Gah as soon as possible. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day amid intense fighting, the UN says. The Taliban are reported to have captured most of the city. But the fighting is continuing and government forces have vowed not to let it fall into militant hands. In a message to residents of the city, Gen Sadat said the army would ""not leave a single Taliban alive"". ""I know it is very difficult for you to leave your houses - it is hard for us too - but if you are displaced for a few days please forgive us,"" he said. Gen Sadat earlier told the BBC that while government forces had lost ground, he believed the Taliban would be unable to sustain their assault. The Taliban assault in Helmand province is part of a major offensive across Afghanistan. The militants have made rapid advancesin recent months as US forces have withdrawn after 20 years of military operations in the country. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign, and any Taliban gains there would be a blow for the Afghan government. If Lashkar Gah fell, it would be the first provincial capital won by the Taliban since 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. Residents of Lashkar Gah say they are living in fear as the city faces heavy assault from the militants, who are being targeted with US and Afghan air strikes. ""Neither the Taliban will have mercy on us nor will the government stop the bombing. There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" one resident told the BBC. Another said: ""I do not know where to go, there are clashes in every corner of the city."" Who are the Taliban? How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) says civilians are ""bearing the brunt"" of the fighting, with the Taliban ground offensive and Afghan air strikes causing the most harm. It has called on both sides to do more to protect civilians, including an immediate end to fighting in urban areas. In addition to the fatalities, dozens of people have been injured and thousands displaced, according to Unama. Doctors in Lashkar Gah say they are overwhelmed and running low on supplies. ""There is fighting all around,"" one told the BBC. An Afghan interpreter living in the city said his life was under threat from the Taliban because he had worked for the British forces. ""My own house which I left yesterday has been captured by the Taliban and they are living there and they were asking for me,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen in the future but they are looking from house to house to find the people who worked for Nato."" Gen Sadat told the BBC the Taliban were being supported by fighters from other Islamist groups and warned that their gains posed a threat beyond Afghanistan. ""This will increase the hope for small extremist groups to mobilise in the cities of Europe and America, and will have a devastating effect on global security,"" he said. ""This is not a war of Afghanistan, this is a war between liberty and totalitarianism."" Lashkar Gah is one of three provincial capitals under attack. Attempts by the militants to captureKandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, have continued after rocket strikes hit its airport on Sunday. Seizing control of Kandahar would be a huge victory for the Taliban, giving them a grip on the south of the country. Unama says five civilians have been killed and 42 wounded over the past three days. In a third besieged city,Herat, in the west, government commandos are battling the insurgents after days of fierce fighting. Government forces have taken back some areas after a UN compound was attacked on Friday. Videos shared on social media appeared to show residents on the streets and rooftops of Herat shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") in support of the government's gains. As government forces struggled to contain Taliban advances, President Ashraf Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of US troops for the increase in fighting. ""The reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly,"" he told parliament on Monday. Mr Ghani said he had warned Washington that the withdrawal would have ""consequences"". Although nearly all its military forces have left, the US has continued its air offensive in support of government troops. President Biden's administration announced on Monday that because of the increase in violence, it wouldtake in thousands more Afghan refugees who worked with US forces. The US and UK have accused the Taliban of committing possible war crimes by ""massacring civilians"" in a town captured near the Pakistan border.

New Greggs stores set to create 500 jobs,"Bakery chain Greggs has said it expects to create 500 new retail jobs in the coming months as it continues to open new outlets. The new jobs come as part of the chain's plans to open about 100 net new stores by the end of the year. Greggs swung back to profit during the first half of the year as its sales rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. The stronger-than-expected sales mean it now expects full-year profits to be ""slightly ahead"" of previous forecasts. Greggs reported profits of Â£55.5m for six months to 3 July, compared with a Â£65.2m loss a year earlier.. The chain said the recovery in trade in recent months had been ""stronger than we had anticipated"", helped by the easing of Covid restrictions. The lifting of restrictions ""made a significant difference to footfall"", it said, with sales in the second quarter up 2.8% compared with the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. However, Greggs saw a mixed performance from its stores. It said its shops in public transport hubs and large city centres were among its weaker performing outlets, suggesting that many workers have yet to return to the office. In contrast, ""customers staying closer to home are supporting our heartland shops in suburban and High Street areas"". ""The strongest locations continue to be shops typically accessed by car,"" it added. Greggs is looking at even more ambitious growth plans as it said it had ""the opportunity to expand its UK estate to at least 3,000 shops"". Empty shop numbers rise as Covid continues to bite The experiences replacing closed High Street stores It had 2,115 locations at the start of July. ""Greggs once again showed its resilience in a challenging first half, emerging from the lockdown months in a strong position and rebuilding sales as social restrictions were progressively relaxed,"" said boss Roger Whiteside. The group has also targeted growth areas such as delivery and drive-thru sales. ""Greggs' results reflect its underlying strength as a business,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. ""The company is feeling the full effect of a 'return to normal' along with the benefits of its investment in digital and the adaptations made to its estate to accommodate new customer habits during lockdown."" The chain needs another vegan sausage roll success, reckons Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""Now that workplaces are opening and staff are returning to city centres, Greggs cannot afford to let up the pace,"" she said. ""It has already started playing up the passion that its customers have for its food, but if it hopes to get back to the heights of giving out bonuses to its staff then it needs restrictions permanently eased, pandemic contingency plans in place and, almost inevitably, another vegan sausage roll of a PR campaign."" Greggs launched a new vegan sausage, bean and cheese melt launched last week. ""That is likely to bring a little extra sauce to sales in the coming months,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown.

Taliban gains pose global threat - Afghan general,"Afghan forces are battling the Taliban in Lashkar Gah Residents of a besieged Afghan city have been urged to evacuate ahead of an army operation against the Taliban. General Sami Sadat, who is leading the battle against the Taliban in the southern province of Helmand, called on people to leave its capital Lashkar Gah as soon as possible. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day amid intense fighting, the UN says. The Taliban are reported to have captured most of the city. But the fighting is continuing and government forces have vowed not to let it fall into militant hands. In a message to residents of the city, Gen Sadat said the army would ""not leave a single Taliban alive"". ""I know it is very difficult for you to leave your houses - it is hard for us too - but if you are displaced for a few days please forgive us,"" he said. Gen Sadat earlier told the BBC that while government forces had lost ground, he believed the Taliban would be unable to sustain their assault. The Taliban assault in Helmand province is part of a major offensive across Afghanistan. The militants have made rapid advancesin recent months as US forces have withdrawn after 20 years of military operations in the country. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign, and any Taliban gains there would be a blow for the Afghan government. If Lashkar Gah fell, it would be the first provincial capital won by the Taliban since 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. Residents of Lashkar Gah say they are living in fear as the city faces heavy assault from the militants, who are being targeted with US and Afghan air strikes. ""Neither the Taliban will have mercy on us nor will the government stop the bombing. There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" one resident told the BBC. Another said: ""I do not know where to go, there are clashes in every corner of the city."" Who are the Taliban? How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) says civilians are ""bearing the brunt"" of the fighting, with the Taliban ground offensive and Afghan air strikes causing the most harm. It has called on both sides to do more to protect civilians, including an immediate end to fighting in urban areas. In addition to the fatalities, dozens of people have been injured and thousands displaced, according to Unama. Doctors in Lashkar Gah say they are overwhelmed and running low on supplies. ""There is fighting all around,"" one told the BBC. An Afghan interpreter living in the city said his life was under threat from the Taliban because he had worked for the British forces. ""My own house which I left yesterday has been captured by the Taliban and they are living there and they were asking for me,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen in the future but they are looking from house to house to find the people who worked for Nato."" Gen Sadat told the BBC the Taliban were being supported by fighters from other Islamist groups and warned that their gains posed a threat beyond Afghanistan. ""This will increase the hope for small extremist groups to mobilise in the cities of Europe and America, and will have a devastating effect on global security,"" he said. ""This is not a war of Afghanistan, this is a war between liberty and totalitarianism."" Lashkar Gah is one of three provincial capitals under attack. Attempts by the militants to captureKandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, have continued after rocket strikes hit its airport on Sunday. Seizing control of Kandahar would be a huge victory for the Taliban, giving them a grip on the south of the country. Unama says five civilians have been killed and 42 wounded over the past three days. In a third besieged city,Herat, in the west, government commandos are battling the insurgents after days of fierce fighting. Government forces have taken back some areas after a UN compound was attacked on Friday. Videos shared on social media appeared to show residents on the streets and rooftops of Herat shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") in support of the government's gains. As government forces struggled to contain Taliban advances, President Ashraf Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of US troops for the increase in fighting.

LiveLiveIndustry welcomes scrapping of amber watchlist idea2 minutes ago,"The UK reports another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest since late June Almost all of Scotland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions are to end from 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon confirms Social distancing will be dropped in most settings but a number of mitigation measures will remain in place It means more capacity in pubs and restaurants and larger crowds at sporting events and concerts Meanwhile, a proposal to create an ""amber watchlist"" of travel destinations has been abandoned by the UK government It would have warned people when a country was at risk of a sudden shift to the more-restricted red list Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the air travel industry body Airlines UK, says it is a ""victory for common sense"" Deaths in the UK mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate rose by 46% in the week to 23 July, the Office for National Statistics says Qantas says it will stand down 2,500 staff as a lockdown in Sydney impacts air travel across Australia Authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan will begin testing its entire population, after some coronavirus cases were found Edited by Emma Owen Goodbye and thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. We'll be back tomorrow morning with more updates. As ever, any major developments will be covered on our main pages,here. Today's posts were written by Alexandra Fouche, Emma Harrison, Becky Morton and Katie Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke and Emma Owen. China is currently seeing one of its biggest Covid outbreaks in months And here is a round-up of what's been going on around the world: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly so here's a recap of the main developments in the UK today: Adam FlemingChief political correspondent For five days the government mulled the idea of an ""amber watchlist"" to warn travellers that the country they intended to visit could imminently turn from amber to red on the traffic light system for international travel. That would mean an 11-night stay in a hotel and a Â£1,750 bill when they returned to the UK. The policy-making process played out in a very public way. The concept of the amber watchlist - which would have added a sixth category to the original three in the traffic light scheme - was proposed to the government's Covid Operations Committee last week by officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre. It was supported by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Then the idea leaked and the backlash began. There was criticism from the travel industry but also from anonymous government sources, quoted in the newspapers. These sources were alleged to include Shapps. ""Interesting that the transport secretary briefed against his own policy,"" a senior Whitehall source observed as they explained the prime minister's decision to ""kill"" the amber watchlist on Monday.

have today been arriving at one of its 550 vaccination centres to receive their jabs as a nationwide campaign begins. The country, which is facing a third wave
of the pandemic, has received a million doses of the single-jab Johnson
& Johnson vaccine from the US under the Covax scheme. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who got her injection last week, said Tanzania has placed another order for the vaccine
through the African Union as part of its plan to initially target more
than 60% of the population. The start of this  campaign comes at a
time when public opinion is divided over the safety of the vaccines. The president, who has shifted the country away from the Covid scepticism of her predecessor, has urged Tanzania to come out and get the jab. The country was one of the last on the continent to receive any vaccines. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is nowurging people not to travel unless necessary,,externalafter an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Nanjing has spread to other
cities. Cases of Covid-19 were first identified among workers at an
international airport in Nanjing on 20 July. Since then, official media have
confirmed cases have been detected in 15 provincial-level regions,
many of which are the Delta variant. There are 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. Cases linked to Nanjing have been identified in major
cities such as Chengdu and Beijing, and have led to local lockdowns. New caseshave now been detected in the city of Wuhan,the original Covid-19 epicentre,
for the first time since June 2020. There are also cases in Zhengzhou, a city that has experienced devastating
floods in recent weeks. China has not seen a widespread outbreak like this since
the beginning of the year, when an outbreak in the north-east city of
Shijiazhuang spread to multiple eastern provinces. The official Nanjing Daily has today confirmed a special quarantine base
with 2,000 roomswill now be built to treat patients in the city.,external Transport links in and out of Nanjing have largely been
suspended, and residents are currently undergoing a fourth round of Covid-19
tests. Nanjing has a population of 9.2 million people. Morocco is introducing new coronavirus restrictions, including a night curfew, as infection rates rise. The prime minister's office tweeted,externalthat the curfew would begin on Tuesday night and would last from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) until 05:00. The statement also said travel to and from Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir would be banned except for those with a vaccination passport or for medical emergencies. Morocco - along with other countries in north Africa - has seen an alarming rise in infections, mainly from the Delta variant, in the past few weeks. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon is desperate not to call it âfreedomâ day or to declare âvictoryâ over the virus but it is a big moment in the pandemic. From next Monday most Covid restrictions will end in Scotland - almost 17 months after the initial lockdown. That includes lifting (except in schools) the one metre social distancing rule that limits capacity in restaurants and on ferries and prevents the operation of nightclubs. This is possible, weâre told, because the rate of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to decline and the vaccination rate is rising. The big difference with England is the measures that will remain in force. Mask wearing will continue to be a requirement on public transport and in shops and for at least the next six weeks in Scottish schools. The Conservatives say ongoing restrictions will âhold Scotland backâ but the first minister insists continued caution will ultimately help economic recovery. From 9 August, most rules on social distancing and limits to the size of gatherings will be lifted in Scotland. However, face coverings will continue to be mandatory in most public indoor settings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this would be kept under review, but was likely to continue ""for some time to come"". The law does not require people keep a certain distance from each other in most public places. But advice remains to keep a safe distance from those in other households - especially indoors - and to avoid crowded places. In schools - for up to six weeks next term - staff will still be required to keep at least 1m from each other and from children. Headhereto find out the social distancing rules in the rest of the UK. Some 73% of the UKâs adult population is now fully vaccinated,according to the latest government figures.,external More than 38.5 million people have received two doses of a Covid vaccine
â up 126,307 from the previous day. Another 26,114 received a first dose of a vaccine, meaning 46.9
million people have had a first jab â 88.7% of the UK adult population. The UK has reported another 21,691 daily Covid cases â the fewest
since late June. The last time case numbers were lower was on 29 June, when 20,479 were reported. There were also a further 138 deaths recorded within 28 days
of a positive test, which is the highest since 17 March.

He has been unable to return to work because of the persistent brain fog, which causes him to lose track in the middle of sentences and makes it hard to process large amounts of information. He is one of a number of patients who will be taking part in a long-term study of the illness. Jason Lim struggles with ordinary tasks due to the brain fog caused by long Covid. Reality Check The US has now given one dose of vaccine to 70% of all adults,externalâ a target originally set for 4 July by President Joe Biden. After being one of the top nations for its vaccine rollout
earlier in the year, the US is now behind neighbouring Canada in terms of doses
administered as a share of population. And itâs also behind the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies, such as Japan, but
the US vaccination rate has dropped off more significantly than in other
developed countries. In the middle of April, the US was giving out more than three
million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this
is a slight increase on mid-July levels. BBC Reality Check has looked into where
vaccinations are lagging in the US, and why,here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Two weeks after lifting restrictions in England, the predicted spike of 100,000 new cases a day has not materialised. That bodes well for Scotland to follow suit. Scotland was the first part of the UK to see a big surge in cases at the start of July but since then, the data has been positive and even the more cautious scientists say it looks good to proceed. Some experts believe one thing that has helped is that behaviour has not significantly changed. We are not in contact with as many people, and many have continued to keep a distance. With vaccines doing such an amazing job, could small efforts like this be enough to keep the virus at bay? What is around the corner is a bit tricky to predict. We will see a return to schools and universities in the next few weeks, coupled with the end of the holiday season and cooler weather on the horizon. Thatâs why things like the wearing of face coverings and an encouragement to work from home will continue for now. The hope is the worst is behind us, but Covid has taken us by surprise before - it still could now. A Covid-19 infection spike in Lincoln has been pinpointed to a nightclub in the city, health bosses have said. New cases increased by 83% to 649 in the week to 29 July, giving the area England's highest infection rate of 654 per 100,000 people. The Wharf and University district, a popular destination for bars, clubs and restaurants, recorded a rate of 1,140. Natalie Liddle, from Public Health Lincolnshire, said the majority of cases were in people aged under 30. ""We are currently managing a cluster of outbreaks in and around Lincoln - and we've seen a particular increase in cases linked to the night-time economy,"" she said. ""We are particularly dealing with one large outbreak at the moment, [and] that has impacted a large number of people."" She declined to name the venue involved. Read the full story. Guidance for universities and colleges in Scotland on operating beyond level zero has now been published, Nicola Sturgeon confirms. Students will be asked to take a PCR test before moving to student accommodation and then asked to test twice a week thereafter. The first minister is now taking questions from MSPs -you can follow the latest on our Scotland live page. Spain welcomed 10 times more tourists in June than in the same month last year at the height of the pandemic. Some 2.2 million tourists entered Spain in June this year, nearly a quarter of them from Germany,the country's official statistical agency, INE, said,external. But the total is still only a quarter of the visitors before the coronavirus crisis. Spain's economy contracted sharply by 10.8% in 2020, one of the worst results in the eurozone, the AFP news agency reports.But it is now forecast to grow again this year,external. Here's a recap of the changes Nicola Sturgeon has just announced for Scotland from 9 August:  Read further detail on the changes in our story here.  Ms Sturgeon urges the public to ""continue to be careful, cautious, and sensible even as legal
restrictions are lifted"". ""We all hope that the restrictions we lift next Monday will
never have to be reimposed, but no one can guarantee that,"" she says. In winter the virus âmay well pose challenges for us againâ. She urges people to get the vaccine, test regularly and stick to the rules that remain in place, such as on face coverings. Meet outdoors as much as possible, she says, and ventilate the space if you are meeting indoors. Even if it is no longer legally mandated these measures are ""still
sensible precautionsâ, she says. Secondary school pupils will need to keep wearing masks for at least the first six weeks of the new term Nicola Sturgeon now sets out changes to guidance for schools. She says blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine and instead there will be a more targeted approach, with fewer young people asked to self-isolate. However, most other mitigations will remain for the first six weeks of the new academic term, the first minister says. This includes one metre social distancing between staff and pupils and face coverings for staff and children aged 12 and over. Sturgeon says these measures will be kept under review. All secondary pupils and staff will also be asked to take a lateral flow test before
returning after the holidays and twice a week after that. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Boeing set for rerun of space capsule test,"The Starliner stands ready atop its United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket Boeing says it is checking the propulsion system valves on its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, after Tuesday's planned launch was postponed. The CST-100 Starliner will launch from Florida at some point to showcase how it can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It will be the second test flight, and conducted with no people aboard. The previous demonstration in 2019 encountered software problems that very nearly caused the loss of the capsule. The Starliner will ride to orbit on an Atlas-5 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Controllers had been targeting Tuesday for the launch but scrubbed the countdown with two-and-a-half hours left on the clock, to allow for investigation of technical issues related to the capsule's propulsion system. Now Boeing says a rescheduled launch on Wednesday will not happen either,external, because it needs more time to discover the reason for ""unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system"". Boeing's Starliner spacecraft: A guide Astronauts begin historic mission on private craft Astronaut capsule lands after incomplete mission Augustine panel supports commercial space,external Fortunately, the 2019 test Starliner still managed to land safely It's just over 10 years since Boeing first presented its design for the CST-100 Starlinerat the Farnborough Air Showin the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the soon-to-retire space shuttles. The US space agency (Nasa) gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and the SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now two crewed operational flights into this privatised era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And that's because Boeing's first unpiloted ""Orbital Flight Test"" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station. Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, andthe capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to attempt an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). The only ""individual"" aboard will be ""Rosie the Rocketeer"" Chris Ferguson, a former Nasa astronaut and Boeing's director of Starliner mission operations, said the company had run full-mission duration simulations of the new software on the capsule. The new code, he added, had implemented every correction recommended by the review. ""We fixed every one, we addressed every one. We want this next flight to be as clean as it could possibly be,"" he told reporters. ""We have thoroughly dug into, tested and verified hundreds of times the software code, to ensure that it performs exactly the way we intend on OFT-2."" The SpaceX Dragon capsule is already flying crews to the ISS The re-run will follow the same profile: an uncrewed mission to the ISS. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed ""Rosie the Rocketeer"", will once again strap in for the ride. Rosie and ""her"" capsule will stay attached to the station for five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give the agency the two new crew-transportation systemsit sought when the shuttles were retired,externalto museums exactly 10 years ago. ""This is a huge component to returning this launch capability from the United States and having redundancy between SpaceX and Boeing, so that we're not reliant on just one company to get astronauts to the International Space Station,"" said Nicole Mann, a Nasa astronaut who has been selected to fly on the first crewed Starliner mission. And this capability would also open up space to wider participation, she believed: ""You're going to see more folks in low-Earth orbit who are not Nasa astronauts. That's great. I think for the younger generation, they're going to see scientists, engineers and maybe journalists in space, and they're going to be able to capture the amazement of space and share the experience.""
