The mystery death haunting Norway for 46 years,"It's a mystery that has intrigued Norway for nearly 50 years. In November 1970, the badly burnt body of a woman was found in a remote spot in Norway's Isdalen valley. Someone had cut the labels off her clothes, and scraped distinctive marks off her belongings - as if to stop her from being identified. And as police started investigating her death, they uncovered a trail of coded messages, disguises, and fake identities - but never cracked the case. Forty-six years later, Norwegian police andNRK journalists,externalhave decided to reopen the investigation. This is the story of the Isdal Woman - and the perplexing trail of clues she left behind. WARNING: This article contains one graphic image Clue one: The body in 'Death Valley' Isdalen Valley is a short drive from the west-coast city of Bergen On the morning of 29 November 1970, a man and his two young daughters see a body in Isdalen Valley. The corpse is sprawled across some rocks - with its arms extended in a ""boxer"" position, typical of bodies that have been burnt. Isdalen is known to some locals as ""Death Valley"" - it was a site where people committed suicide in medieval times, and, in the 1960s, some hikers had fallen to their deaths while trekking in the fog. But the woman does not appear to be a normal hiker. ""It was out of the way - it was an unusual place to walk,"" Carl Halvor Aas, a police lawyer who was one of the first officers to be called to the scene, recounts to the BBC. He remembers ""a strong smell of burnt flesh"". ""The body was burned all over the front,"" including ""the face and most of her hair"", he says - but strangely it was not burnt on the back. ""It looked like she had thrown herself back"" from a fire, he says, adding that she was so badly burnt they could not imagine what she originally looked like. This is believed to be the spot where the Isdal Woman was found The scene is cold by the time Carl arrived, so he cannot tell how long the body has been there for. And how did the woman end up on fire? Police find a number of objects at the scene, including jewellery, a watch, a broken umbrella and some bottles. But it is the positioning of the objects that leaves the strongest impression on Tormod BÃ¸nes, one of the forensic investigators. The woman is not wearing the watch or her jewellery - instead, they have been placed beside her. ""The placement and location of the objects surrounding the body was strange - it looked like there had been some kind of ceremony,"" he says. Police also find the remains of a pair of rubber boots and nylon stockings. ""She had been wearing a lot of clothes - of synthetic materials - and all the clothes had been heavily burned,"" says Tormod. Adding to the mystery is the fact that the production labels have been cut off her clothes and rubbed off the bottles at the scene. Police find nothing at the scene to indicate who the woman was. The remains of an item of clothing and an umbrella found at the scene Police found items of clothing, drinking bottles, the remains of nylon stockings and pieces of jewellery at the scene Police issue an appeal for eyewitnesses. They say the woman was about 164cm (5ft 4.5 inches) tall, with ""long brownish-black hair"", a small round face, brown eyes, and small ears. She appeared to be aged between 25 and 40 years, and wore her hair ""in a ponytail tied with a blue and white print ribbon"" at the time of death. Without a name, the woman becomes known as the Isdal Woman. An artist's impression of the Isdal Woman, distributed by police The story is big news in Bergen - a peaceful town with a low crime rate. A few days later, police find a clue. They find two suitcases at Bergen railway station's left luggage department. One of the suitcases contains prescription-free glasses - and a fingerprint on one of the pairs matches the woman's. The suitcases also contain: Clothes Several wigs German and Norwegian money - and Belgian, British and Swiss coins A comb and a hairbrush Cosmetics Some teaspoons A tube of eczema cream Initially, police ""were very optimistic because they thought the suitcases would help them identify the body,"" says Tormod. But soon, they realise that ""all the labels that could have identified the woman, her clothes or belongings, had been removed"". Even the prescription sticker on the eczema cream, which would have shown the name of the doctor and the patient, has been scraped off. Police try hard to trace the woman's belongings. They even contact several major department stores abroad, including Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to see if the stores recognise any of packaging on the woman's make up. None of the department stores can find a match. There is also a mysterious coded note in the case - which police will not crack until a while later (see clue five). There is one important piece of evidence in the suitcase - a plastic bag from Oscar RÃ¸rtvedt's Footwear Store - a shoe shop in Stavanger. The owner's son, Rolf RÃ¸rtvedt, remembers selling a pair of rubber boots to ""a very well dressed, nice-looking woman with dark hair"". The boots he sold her appear to match the boots found on the body in the Isdalen valley. Police believe that the umbrella found near the body was also bought from the store. The boots sold at Oscar RÃ¸rtvedt's Footwear Store were similar to the pair found at the Isdalen Valley Rolf says the woman had made an impression on him because she ""took a long time"" choosing her boots - much longer than the average customer. She spoke English, with an accent, and had ""a calm and quiet expression"", he tells the BBC. He also recalls a strong smell emanating from the woman - which, later, he thinks may have been garlic. Using his description, police are able to trace the woman to St Svithun hotel nearby - where she checked in as Fenella Lorch. The problem? Fenella Lorch wasn't her real name. It emerges that the woman had stayed in several hotels in Norway - using different aliases. And since most hotels required guests to show a passport and fill in a check-in form, this means she would have had several fake passports. On this form, the woman claimed she had arrived from London Police find the woman had stayed in the following hotels, under these names: Genevieve Lancier, from Louvain, stayed in Viking Hotel, Oslo from 21-24 March 1970 Claudia Tielt, from Brussels, stayed in Hotel Bristol, Bergen from 24-25 March Claudia Tielt, from Brussels, stayed in Hotel Skandia, Bergen from 25 March to 1 April Claudia Nielsen, from Ghent, stayed in KNA-Hotellet, Stavanger from 29 -30 October Alexia Zarne-Merchez, from Ljubljana, stayed in Neptun Hotel, Bergen from 30 October to 5 November Vera Jarle, from Antwerp, stayed in Hotel Bristol, Trondheim, from 6-8 November Fenella Lorch, stayed in St Svithun Hotel, Stavanger from 9 to 18 November Ms Leenhouwfr, stayed in Hotel Rosenkrantz, Bergen from 18 - 19 November Elisabeth Leenhouwfr, from Ostend, stayed in Hotel Hordaheimen, Bergen from 19-23 November Police matched the different forms together by conducting handwriting analysis This headline reads: ""The woman in Isdalen had at least six different aliases"" The woman left a strong impression on Alvhild Rangnes, who was a 21-year-old waitress at Hotel Neptun at the time. ""My first impression of her was one of elegance and self-assuredness,"" she tells the BBC. ""She looked so fashionable - I wished to be able to mimic her style. In fact, I remember her winking at meâ¦ from my perspective it felt as though she thought I had been staring a bit too much at her."" ""On one occasion while I was serving her, she was in the dining hall, sitting right next to - but not interacting with -  two German navy personnel, one of which was an officer."" The woman's final stay was in the Hotel Hordaheimen Police question several hotel staff who met the Isdal Woman - including Alvhild. They learn that, in addition to speaking English, the woman also used some German phrases. They also learn that the woman often requested a change of room - on one occasion, she asked to change rooms three times. By now, there are several rumours that the woman was a spy. There weren't too many foreign tourists in Bergen then - and the fact the woman seemed wealthy, and well-travelled, sparked a lot of speculation. ""This was during the Cold War, and there were definitely a lot of spies in Norway, including Russian spies,"" says Gunnar Staalesen, a Bergen-based crime author who was a university student at the time. There were also Israeli agents operating in Norway - as shown three years later, when Mossad agents killed a man in Lillehammer they had mistaken for a terrorist, he adds. This headline reads: ""Rumours say the woman was a secret agent"" Norwegian intelligence services are investigating too - but will not admit it until decades later. According to NRK, security services were interested in reports that the woman had been seen observing the military test out new rockets in western Norway - but there weren't any clear conclusions from their investigation reports. Police eventually crack some of the coded note - but it doesn't provide any evidence that she's a spy. Instead, it appears to be a record of the places the woman visited. For example, O22 O28 P are dates (22-28 October) she was in Paris, O29PS is the day she travelled from Paris to Stavanger, O29S matches the date she arrived in Stavanger (29 October), and O30BN5 matches her stay in Bergen from 30 October to 5 November. Police send a description of the woman, and sketches of what she may have looked like, to several police forces abroad. But none of them say they can identify the woman. Meanwhile, investigators complete an examination of the woman's body. They find an unexplained bruise on the right side of her neck, that could have been the result of a blow or a fall. There are no signs that the woman had been ill. The autopsy also finds that the woman had never been pregnant or had a child. One of the forensic cards summarising the autopsy findings. The woman's name, position, address, date of birth and death are all listed as ""unknown"". Her death is likely to have been a painful one. ""There were smoke particles in her lungsâ¦ which shows that the woman was alive while she was burning,"" Tormod says. He found a trace of petrol in the ground below the woman's body, which means ""we can state with certainty that petrol had been used"" to set her alight. She had a high concentration of carbon monoxide in her blood. Experts also establish that there were about 50-70 sleeping pills, from a foreign brand called Fenemal, in her stomach - although they had not been fully absorbed into her bloodstream before she died. Police distributed the woman's fingerprints via Interpol The autopsy concludes the woman died from a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning, and ingesting a large number of sleeping pills. The cause of death is announced to be a probable suicide - a view supported by Bergen's chief of police. But many people find this hard to believe. ""We talked about it in the police, but as far as I remember very few thought it was suicide,"" Carl Halvor Aas says. Both the remote spot where her body was found - and the method of suicide, by fire, strike him as strange. ""I do not believe it was suicide"" - Carl Halvor Aas Without any further leads, the case is closed, and the woman is buried in February 1971. Police think the woman may be Catholic, and organise a Catholic funeral for her. According to a police report of the funeral, the coffin was decorated with lilacs and tulips, and the priest conducted a simple ceremony for ""the unknown woman, who was put to the grave in a foreign country without any family present"". The funeral was attended by police officers Police still hope to find the woman's family - she is buried in a zinc coffin that won't decompose - and keep an album of photos from the funeral for her relatives. Harald Osland was one of the investigators reluctant to let the case go. ""My father could never put this case away,"" his son, Tore, says. ""He never could accept that they had to close down the case."" The unmarked grave where the Isdal Woman's body is buried. The site is marked with a small wreath and candle His father kept several of the police documents, and Tore eventually wrote a book about the Isdal case. Over the years, the case has also inspired several crime writers and illustrators. ""What intrigues people is that it is an unsolved mystery - it is almost like following a crime novel,"" says Gunnar Staalesen. This video can not be played Norwegian crime writers explain the appeal of the Isdal Woman case Then, in 2016, the possibility of solving the case rears its head again. The Isdal Woman had distinctive teeth - 14 of them were filled - and she had several gold crowns. This was especially unusual for someone in her age range - and is not the type of dental work seen in Norway. Gisle Bang, a professor of dentistry, keeps the woman's jaw, in the hope that other experts will recognise the dental work. After his death, everyone assumes the jaw has been destroyed. Forensic doctor Inge Morild, who inherited the Isdal Woman files, says he was told the jaw had been ""thrown away because it was smelling"". But after investigative journalists at NRK make queries about the Isdal Woman, Prof Morild finds the jaw - deep in a cellar in Haukeland University Hospital's forensic archives. The find gives Norwegian police the opportunity to re-open the case, and use the latest forensic techniques to try and identify the woman. Prof Gisle Bang had sent reports to international dental experts The Norwegian Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) and University of Bergen start conducting isotope analysis on her teeth - looking at the chemical ""signature"" left by the elements that made up her teeth as they were being formed. The tests involve: Oxygen isotope analysis, which can reveal the type of water the woman drank as she grew up - and which areas the water came from. Strontium isotope analysis, which can reflect the types of food the woman ate, and the type of soil in the area where she grew up. It's the first time Norwegian police have conducted isotope analysis on teeth - but they hope the findings will help them pinpoint the region where the woman lived. DNA analysis is now one of the key tools police use in forensic analysis and identification cases. It didn't exist back in 1970. But it turns out several tissue samples from the woman's organs, including from her lungs, heart, adrenal gland and ovaries, have been stored at Haukeland University Hospital. Prof Morild says it ""has been a custom in most of Norway"" to keep tissue samples from post mortem examinations. The samples are ""useful for repeat examinations, and as a source of DNA"". Tissue samples from the organs are preserved in paraffin blocks Prof Inge Morild looks through tissue samples belonging to the Isdal Woman NRK and local police agree to send the samples off for DNA analysis. Nils Jarle GjÃ¸vÃ¥g, head of forensics at West Police District, says it's important to pursue the woman's identity because ""somewhere in the world, there may be some relatives wondering where she went"". ""We try to identify every unknown body, so that relatives can have an answer."" While they wait for DNA results, NRK publish a documentary into the investigation - and receive more than 150 tip offs from people interested in the case. ""In Norway, this case is a big enigma for peopleâ¦ there's a lot of people who want some sort of closure in the case,"" says journalist StÃ¥le Hansen. NRK's investigative team (from left to right): Marit Higraff, Eirin Aardal, Ãyvind Bye Skille and StÃ¥le Hansen After months of work, scientists have an extended DNA profile of the woman. The latest results, published on Friday, show the woman was of European descent - making the theory that the woman was an agent from Israel much less likely. Norwegian police are set to issue an Interpol black notice - which seeks information on unidentified bodies - with the new information. European police forces will be asked to check their DNA databases to see if they find a match. ""If someone in her close family is in a DNA registry somewhere, we will get a hit,"" says StÃ¥le Hansen. ""That would be really exciting."" The Isdal Woman case has been unsolved for the last 46 years. But now, modern science has reopened the possibility of this elusive Nordic mystery being solved.

"Is my baby too big, or just big?","When Tom and Elizabeth Flight were told their seven-month-old baby Arlo was in the 90th percentile for height, the 97th percentile for weight and the 99th for head circumference, they began to worry. How big can a baby get and still be considered normal, asks Jordan Dunbar. ""I'm worried he's one of the biggest babies in America,"" says his father Tom, a 6' 3"" (191cm) Brit who moved to Texas to marry Elizabeth. At birth, Arlo weighed seven-and-a-half pounds, but he grew rapidly over the next six months on a diet of breast milk alone. For the last month he has been getting formula milk as well from time to time, and he's now more than three times his birth weight - 24lb (11kg). And 30in (76cm) tall. The percentile figures come from a growth chart produced by America's Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Every five years the CDC measures hundreds of thousands of babies, children and young adults up to the age of 20, and the resulting charts allow doctors to assess what percentage of children of a given age group are taller or heavier than the patient in front of them. ""If you line up 100 babies of Arlo's age, from the shortest to the longest. Arlo would be 97,"" says Dr Joe Hagan from the American Academy of Pediatrics, explaining what it means to be in the 97th percentile. ""If you count head circumference he'd be 99."" So only one in 100 American babies aged seven months has a bigger head circumference than Arlo. Does this matter? Hagan is completely relaxed about it. Head circumference helps doctors to judge whether a baby's brain is developing normally, he says, but the key thing is that the head is in proportion with the rest of the body, and Arlo's is. ""I would expect at Arlo's weight and height that his head circumference would be in the 99th percentile,"" says Hagan. The charts produced by the CDC in the US are based on the measurements of real-life Americans. But over time, American children have been getting bigger, and an increasing number of American children are overweight. By contrast the World Health Organization (WHO) has attempted to chart ""optimal growth"" for a child. To do this, it measured growing children in six countries: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and the US. But not just any children. They had to be breast-fed from birth, and vaccinated early in life. Babies whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy were not counted. Dr Mercedes De Onis, who helped to gather the data, says the WHO's work shows babies develop at a similar rate all over the world, ""provided they are given proper care"". The WHO charts ""describe healthy growth in optimal conditions and are therefore growth standards rather than growth references"", says US paediatrician Joe Hagan. He points out that in the US the CDC is now recommending that the WHO charts should be taken as the standard for children in the US between zero and two years old. What about Arlo's weight? Is that a problem? Once again, Hagan draws attention to Arlo's height. The key thing to look at is his body mass index, or BMI - his weight in relation to his height. ""So here's a guy who's tall, he's long. And longer children weigh more,"" says Hagan. ""Arlo probably has a BMI that is in the mid-80s to low 90s which would be considered overweight."" Overweight, but not obese. What's more, Hagan expects that as Arlo makes the transition from milk to solids, and starts moving more, he will even out a little. So is there any cause for concern? ""No, not like this. Because I'm looking at Arlo's dad who's tall and Arlo's mom, who's probably tall, and I'm thinking: 'Gee, this is OK growth for Arlo.'"" Arlo is one of the biggest babies of his age in the US, and as American babies are bigger than the world average, it's also true to say he is one of the biggest in the world. But it seems that's fine. More or Lessis broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service Download the More or Lesspodcast More storiesfrom More or Less ""I spend a lot of my time in my day-to-day work as a paediatrician telling parents you really don't need to worry about this and about that,"" Hagan says. Parents often compare the size of their child to others, he says, and very often it's his task to reassure them that even if their child is bigger or smaller, there is a ""wide range of normal"".

UK's Lucie Jones 'in Eurovision to win it',"This video can not be played UK Eurovision artist Lucie Jones shares her predictions for this year The bookies say the UK can't possibly win Eurovision this year. But singer Lucie Jones still believes there's a chance of an upset. ""Never tell me the odds!"" says Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back after C-3PO tells him his chances of successfully navigating an asteroid field are 3,720 to 1. It's a sentiment Lucie Jones would no doubt agree with, having been confronted daily with people telling her how unlikely she is to win Eurovision this year. ""People tell me the odds every day but I don't pay them any attention,"" insists the Cardiff-born singer, who'll be representing the UK on Saturday with Never Give Up on You. 8 songs to look out for at Eurovision How to host the perfect Eurovision party Nine looks that rocked Eurovision ""You can't believe the odds; anything can happen with these shows. I was favourite to win The X Factor [in 2009] and I got kicked out in favour of Jedward!"" Yet the experience was a beneficial one, eventually leading to her being asked to sing at Eurovision just like the bequiffed Irish twins were in 2011 and 2012. From Albania and Cyprus to Romania and Sweden, this year's crop of hopefuls all seem to have at least one TV talent show under their belts. Lucie Jones will perform Never Give Up on You Do programmes like Pop Idol, The Voice and The X Factor act as a breeding ground for future Eurovision stars? Pretty much, believes Jones. ""There are so many of these shows now that everyone who wants to be a singer sees them as a platform,"" the 26-year-old tells the BBC. ""People try and use them as a springboard to go on to the next thing, which is exactly what happened to me."" But back to those odds. At the time of writing, the shortest odds you could find for a Lucie triumph were 20/1. Italy, by contrast, were 11/10 favourite with most bookmakers, followed by Portugal at 7/4. All evidence points to another year of Eurovision disappointment for the UK, who haven't won the competition now for 20 years. Yet the odds for a top five finish - no small achievement considering the UK's recent record - are considerably shorter. Ask anyone at the massive Eurovision venue in Kiev and they have Lucie pegged as a plucky runner-up to this year's heavy hitters. As far as Jones is concerned, though, she's in it to win it. ""You have to be,"" she declares. ""You have to come to these things hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. ""I'm here to do my best and give it absolutely everything, and as long as the UK is proud of what we've done here I'll be happy."" All in all, taking part in Eurovision this year has been ""the most insane rollercoaster experience"" and one she will look back on ""with utter joy and pride"". It's also one that has given her plenty of memorable moments - among thema smooch with the dancing gorilla,externalwho appears alongside Italy's Francesco Gabbani. ""That was on my bucket list,"" laughs Jones, who now considers many of her fellow competitors ""really good friends"". ""We're like-minded people having an amazing time and loving what we're doing,"" she continues. ""There's just some amazing personalities to be around.""

Dying man and son hope to forge Lego legacy,"Damien MacRae and his son, Aiden, have made their toys sun-smart As he endured radiotherapy, Damien MacRae found playing Lego with his seven-year-old son, Aiden, was one way to block out the pain. The pair built spaceships, pirate galleons and fortresses in their Sydney home following the discovery of melanoma on Mr MacRae's ear three years ago. But in the piles of interlocking plastic bricks, Aiden could not find pieces to create an Australian beach. His father soon realised none existed. So the two decided to conceive their own, in what would become a very personal mission. Cancer has since spread to Mr MacRae's lungs and brain. Last month in a Facebook message, he told friends that his brain tumours had multiplied. ""Unfortunately, my doctors say that I have 6-10 weeks left to live. Six months would be a miracle,"" he wrote in the post on 14 April. ""Obviously this has made me focus on spending as much time as I can with family and friends."" The pair spent hours fine-tuning their beach-themed Lego set Mr MacRae asked for help in realising his ""one dying wish"": to get Lego to consider making Surf Lego Rescue, the idea invented on Aiden's bedroom floor. First they would need 10,000 votes on a Lego concepts website. ""I think everyone gets why this project has become so important to me and Aiden,"" Mr MacRae told his friends. The total was reached within days, meaning the project will be considered. Mr MacRae said he had never seen his son more excited. ""To see him dancing and smiling because of this, I've never been prouder,"" he told the BBC. ""It's the happiest I've seen him in a long time."" The father and son had spent hours talking about their ideas, taking inspiration from Australia's iconicSurf Life Saving,externalvolunteer group. They ordered custom-made toys from a company in London. ""The Lego universe doesn't have much that reflects Australian culture,"" Mr MacRae said. ""There is a Sydney Opera House toy set but not much else."" Their collection captures a sense of fun at the beach, but it also highlights the dangers of sun exposure. The lifeguard characters are named after celebrities who had skin cancer scares, such as Nicole Kidman andHugh Jackman. All wear sunscreen and hats. One of the leading causes of melanoma is a history of sunburn, especially in childhood The colours of the toys pay tribute to Australia's volunteer lifeguards The set also includes surfers, a lifeboat, a jet ski, a quad bike, seagulls, a jellyfish and a shark-patrolling drone. ""I'm not a Lego designer at all,"" Mr MacRae laughed. ""I'm a 42-year-old intellectual property lawyer."" The Danish company will decide soon if it will produce the set. If it does, it is likely to take at least 10 months before sale. ""What a fantastic project, depicting an action-packed day at the beach, full of thoughtful and playable details,"" a Lego spokeswoman said. Australia'sFinancial Review,externalnewspaper reported that Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, whose family owns Lego, had been personally moved by the campaign. Aiden's favourite figure has been given his name Since 2010, 19 projects from the Lego Ideas platform have been made - such asWomen of Nasa. ""They've been really generous with their kind words and indicated they will take my illness into consideration when they're doing the review,"" Mr MacRae said. But Mr MacRae knows that time is running out. ""Getting to 10,000 votes was my goal,"" he said. ""And the possibility that I could leave a legacy for Aiden."" ""To know that he can take ideas that he's come up with, on the bedroom floor, and take it out to the world."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Who does crowdfunding for a complete stranger?,"This video can not be played Shane Yerrell: The crowdfunding superhero who raises money for strangers The meteoric rise of crowdfunding has revolutionised how easy it is to help out those in need. Often fundraising is done by friends or family, but an increasing number of people are setting up pages for complete strangers whose stories tug at their heartstrings. So how do you go about changing the life of someone you've never met? Shane Yerrell is a man on a mission. The victim of a knife attack a decade ago, he decided to turn his hand to helping others, and has raised more than Â£20,000 for a number of causes since 2011. He has climbed a mountain, shaved his head, walked from London to Brighton - and he has set up crowdfunding pages for people who he does not know, and might never meet. ""If I won the lottery, I'd be the first millionaire to become skint,"" said Mr Yerrell, 33, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, who works with adults who have learning disabilities. ""When I read stories in the news, I get a bit more affected by them than most people do. I get really annoyed to the point where I want to make a stand and help them there and then. ""You don't have to know someone to want to help them."" Shane Yerrell decided to help Liam Bradshaw after hearing about the car crash he was involved in One of the people Mr Yerrell has crowdfunded for is 21-year-old Liam Bradshaw, from Enfield, who was involved in a catastrophic car crash in which his three friends died in 2012. ""I was left with 17 fractures to the face, broken collarbones, a nose job and a titanium forehead. I was in hospital for eight and a half months,"" Mr Bradshaw recalls. When Mr Yerrell heard in the news about what had happened, he approached Mr Bradshaw's family and asked if he could help to raise money for his recovery, through a fundraising page and by climbing Mount Toubkal in Morocco. ""Shane came along towards the end of my hospital life. The guy has the kindest heart - he went out of his way to help a stranger so that stranger could live his life again,"" Mr Bradshaw said. ""I'm so glad it happened, because if I hadn't had the accident, I wouldn't have met someone with such a good heart,"" he added. ""From what Shane did for me, I've then come out of hospital to go and coach disabled children for Tottenham Hotspur. ""We've gone beyond friends now - he's more like family."" Liam Bradshaw said he had been inspired by the actions of a stranger - Shane Yerrell - who had raised money for him after his accident Giving back Bridey Watson set up a crowdfunding page to help a complete stranger after money was raised to help her through her illness Bridey Watson, 35, from Bristol, was on the receiving end of crowdfunding a few years ago, after contracting babesiosis, a malaria-like parasitic disease developed from a tick bite. ""I was bed and wheelchair-bound, having seizures every day,"" she recalls. ""When the doctors finally worked out what was wrong, my friends and family set up a crowdfunding page for me to go to Germany and the US for treatment, where tick-borne diseases are better understood and treated. ""The crowdfunding other people did for me enabled me to regain my health and rebuild my life."" Ms Watson is still recovering from the effects of babesiosis, but was inspired to help someone else in need following her own experience. She said she was horrified by an assault on 17-year-old asylum seeker Kurdish-Iranian Reker Ahmed, who was chased and subjected to a""brutal attack""in Croydon at the end of March. ""He's finally thinking he's reached a place of sanctuary, only to be attacked - I could picture the terribleness of what he'd been through,"" she said. ""From my own experience, I knew the messages people left were as important as the physical health money can bring. And that's what I wanted to do for the guy who was attacked."" Ms Waton's page to help an attacked asylum seeker smashed its target The psychology behind setting up a crowdfunding page for a stranger can be split into three categories, says philanthropic psychologist Jen Shang. ""Typically, people help strangers to make themselves feel good, to make others feel good, or both,"" she said. ""Some people don't want to get up close and personal with the people they help - they want to keep it all at arm's length and have a simple, easy and warm way of helping. ""Others prefer to have direct contact with the people they're helping, and crowdfunding sites offer a channel where that sort of connection is possible."" Ms Shang, who works as research director at the University of Plymouth's Centre for Sustainable Philanthropy, said although the percentage of people donating money to charity or other causes ""has not changed in the UK or the US for decades,"" new methods of giving were constantly being invented, with crowdfunding ""the new kid on the block"". ""For people like Mr Yerrell, crowdfunding might be the most 'sustainable' way of giving - the way that sustains the knowledge and feeling you're caring about others. ""Psychologists say as long as you're a human, you want to care about others."" Top tips for crowdfunding for strangers JustGiving, the UK's first online fundraising platform, says more than 191,000 pages are created each year GoFundMe, another of the largest crowdfunding sites, was created in 2010 and has so far raised more than $3bn (Â£2.34bn) worldwide. If you want to set up a crowdfunding page for someone you have never met, the most important piece of advice is to ask the person in question if they approve of what you want to do. JustGiving and GoFundMe say refunds will be made if the person involved does not want to accept the donations. ""These cases are very rare but if they happen, we would work with the campaign organiser and the intended beneficiary to come to a solution - for example donating the money to a charity or refunding donors,"" said John Coventry, head of UK communications at GoFundMe. ""Ultimately, people are kind. They see something in the news that moves them and they want to help - that's why GoFundMe exists: as a tool that helps people to help others. Explain how the funds will reach the recipient, says the director of PR for JustGiving, Rhys Goode. ""If this changes in any way, we would advise page owners to update their page accordingly."" The Parker family - Harry, Glen, Danielle and Mia - have experienced the kindness of strangers For the Parker family, who live in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a stranger's help could not have come at a better time. They were trying to raise Â£75,000 for specialised surgery to help seven-year-old Harry, who has cerebral palsy, to be able to walk. Mr Yerrell was introduced to them by a friend, but had not met the family before that, and ended up helping to hit the fundraising target. ""It's unbelievable - the amount of people he's helped. We weren't the first and I know we won't be the last,"" Harry's dad Glen said. ""As soon as I met him, I knew he was genuine. It's a life changer for Harry and us as a family. People like him don't come along every day."" Harry's mum Danielle said Mr Yerrell - whose work has been recognised with a British Citizen Award and a Pride of Essex Award - had become ""a big part"" of the family's life. ""Not only has he helped us, he's a genuinely nice person. Sometimes you need someone like him in your life to make you think everything will be alright, especially when you're going through a tough time."" Crowdfunding coups - and controversies Call for fundraising pages to be regulated amid fraud concerns,external Crowdfunding provides boost for biotechnology industry Private cancer therapy 'crowdfunding rise' When crowdfunding projects go wrong How to spot a fake crowdfunding page Mr Yerrell has founded a community interest company, Through the Fight, with the aim of gaining charity status in the coming year. He will also be taking some time for himself, he said, because ""you don't want to make people sick of it"". ""I want to have time to do NVQ at work,"" he said. ""But if something was to happen to someone I knew, I'd be there first person to try to help. ""I put everything into my fundraising. It's not just setting up the pages - you have to contact the person of their family, put your own money into it, promote it. ""I'm not well off, but that money could go down the pub or on silly things. I will always want to help and make a difference, but you need a bit of reality too.""

Chinese lawyer 'wore torture device',"A picture of Mr Li from 2012 and one taken after his release It's a form of restraint that would be more in keeping with the practices of a medieval dungeon than a modern, civilised state. But the device - leg and hand shackles linked by a short chain - is a well-documented part of the toolkit that the Chinese police use to break the will of their detainees. And it is one that they allegedly forced one of this country's most prominent human rights lawyers to wear, for a full month. Li Heping was finally releasedfrom detention on Tuesday and his wife Wang Qiaoling has now had time to learn about the treatment he endured over his almost two-year-long incarceration. ""In May 2016 in the Tianjin Number One Detention Centre, he was put in handcuffs and shackles with an iron chain linking the two together,"" she tells me. ""It meant that he could not stand up straight, he could only stoop, even during sleeping. He wore that instrument of torture 24/7 for one month."" She adds: ""They wanted him to confess."" In one sense, Mr Li was lucky. A 2015investigation by Human Rights Watch,externalinto the use of torture by the Chinese police revealed the case of a man who was forced to wear this type of device for eight years. In 2014 an Amnesty International report documented the supply and manufacture of torture equipment by Chinese companies, including the combined hand and leg cuffs. Torture devices like the one allegedly used on Li Heping are readily available online ""The use of these devices causes unnecessary discomfort and can easily result in injuries,"" William Nee, China Researcher at Amnesty International, tells me. ""Such devices place unwarranted restrictions on the movement of detainees and serve no legitimate law enforcement purpose that cannot be achieved by the use of handcuffs alone."" Li Heping is one of a group of human rights lawyers who were detained in July 2015, in a crackdown since referred to by critics as China's ""war on law."" China's 'war on law' crackdown Of course, threats, intimidation and violence have always been part of the risks for any lawyer daring to take on the might of the Communist Party in its own courts. But President Xi Jinping has made it clear that he sees the ideal of constitutional rights, guaranteed by independent courts, as a threat to national security. So his so-called ""war on law"" sends a clear message. President Xi Jinping sees the constitutional rights guaranteed by independent courts as a threat to national security For those like Mr Li, representing the victims of China's illegal land grabs, religious persecution or political repression, the threat is not just from corrupt local officials or powerful businessmen, but from the state itself. The before and after photos offer a visual clue to his time in detention. One taken in 2012 shows an assured, cheery lawyer. The one taken on his release shows him noticeably thinner and looking older than his years. Wang Qiaoling tells me she barely recognised him. And she tells me about the other forms of ill-treatment that her husband has described to her since his release. ""He was forced to take medicine. They stuffed the pills into his mouth as he refused to take them voluntarily,"" she says. ""The police told him that they were for high blood pressure, but my husband doesn't suffer from that. ""After taking the pills he felt pain in his muscles and his vision was blurred."" ""He was beaten. He endured gruelling questioning while being denied sleep for days on end,"" she goes on. ""And he was forced to stand to attention for 15 hours a day, without moving."" This video can not be played Wang Qiaoling has not heard from her husband Li Heping since he was taken away two months ago Amnesty International's William Nee tells me that each of these methods of ill-treatment could be considered torture by themselves. ""Cumulatively, they would demonstrate a clear intent by the authorities to inflict physical and mental torture with the goal of getting Li Heping to confess,"" he says. ""Since China is a party to the Convention against Torture, these serious allegations should prompt the Chinese authorities to immediately launch a prompt, effective and impartial investigation to assess whether this torture took place."" Despite the prolonged and extreme nature of the alleged torture, Ms Wang tells me her husband never did confess. ""He was worried that he might be tortured to death in the detention centre and he wouldn't make it to meet his family again, so he reached an agreement with the authorities that the trial would be held in secret. ""He would be given a suspended sentence but he never admitted guilt or confessed that he had subverted state power."" At that secret trial, the details of which were released by China's state-controlled media afterwards, the court ruled that Mr Li had ""repeatedly used the internet and foreign media interviews to discredit and attack state power and the legal system"". As a result of his conviction, he is now unable to practise law and has also signed an agreement that he will not carry out any further media interviews. But his wife, despite constant intimidation, refuses to be similarly constrained. Plain-clothes policemen still surround the family home and she was followed to our agreed interview location. And while her account is impossible to independently verify, it tallies with that of other lawyers caught up in the crackdown, including Xie Yang, whose court case was heard this week. He had previously allegedsimilar abuses during his interrogations,external- including shackling, beatings and being made to remain in the same position for hours on end - although the court claims he retracted these allegations during his trial. We called the Tianjin Number One detention centre to ask about the allegations that Li Heping was tortured there. ""We don't do any interviews,"" came the reply. ""If you want to do an interview, please go through the legal and proper channels.""

What is the ransomware causing chaos globally?,"Experts are warning that there could be further ransomware cases this week after the global cyber-attack. So, what has happened and how can organisations and individuals protect themselves from such attacks? Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is ""unprecedented"", according to EU police body Europol. It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend. There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life. In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took. The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments  - $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up. WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk. However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain. You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages. Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre websitecontains advice,externalon how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't. The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. The ransomware has been identified as WannaCry Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised. It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus. In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency. When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction. It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small. Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly. It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The ""kill switch""  that stopped it spreading -accidentally discovered by a security researcher- may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly. Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace. However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace.

Trump/Comey: What's it all about?,"Toppled from a great height - now ex-FBI director James Comey The bigger they are, the harder they fall - the saying goes. At well over 2m tall and serving as head of the FBI as the US president sparred openly with the agency, James Comey was, until Tuesday, a significant figure in all senses of the word. His downfall has caused a seismic reaction in Washington that is continuing to reverberate, and it appears the dust will not settle for some time. If you've been tuned out of the news in the last few days, or are simply feeling lost amid the maelstrom of headlines, conflicting explanations, leaks and speculation (and who could blame you), we're here to set you straight. Put your feet up, and let's go back to the basics of this complex story. James Comey was fired on Tuesday by President Trump, and the first, official explanation for the decision given by the White House was that it was due to his botched handling of the conclusion of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. That explanation would almost immediately be contradicted by news reports and later the president himself. But let's put that aside for one moment. To understand why James Comey is a household name in the first place (his predecessor Robert Mueller headed the FBI for 12 years - but you may not know his name) it's important to recall that he made two key interventions during the presidential campaign. In July 2016, he publicly stated that Mrs Clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling sensitive material on her private email server, and that she should not be prosecuted. Then, 11 days before November's election, when Mr Comey dropped a bombshell, saying he had reopened the inquiry because new Clinton-related emails had been found. The Clinton camp were furious but Donald Trump said the decision ""took guts"". Mr Trump's letter dismissing Mr Comey was released by the White House on Tuesday Two days before the election Mr Comey said the emails had been reviewed, and nothing had actually changed - Mrs Clinton should still not face criminal charges. Mr Trump changed his tune, and the FBI director was later blamed by Democrats for Mrs Clinton's election loss. This is the piece of the James Comey story that explains why his firing has led to such a furore. As you're probably aware,the US intelligence community believesthat the Russian government hacked Democratic Party and Clinton campaign emails in order to help Mr Trump win the election. President Trump has continuously pushed back against that finding, and has been angered by an FBI investigation into the alleged interference that is also specifically examining possible links (and cooperation) between figures in his campaign and the Russian government. In March, Mr Comey said publicly the FBI would ""follow the facts wherever they lead"". It is for this reason that there has been so much shock and outrage to Mr Comey's sacking. For many commentators, it was a blatant attempt to hurt the investigation - and Democrats are now calling for a special counsel to be appointed to lead the inquiry to protect its independence. Comey fired: The shifting explanations The firing of James Comey was always going to be controversial but President Trump had at least one strong argument to deploy: many Democrats had called for the FBI director to step down after the Clinton email saga - so why should they kick up such a fuss now that it had happened? But from the outset, President Trump made it clear that there were other things on his mind when he took the decision to fire Mr Comey aside from his handling of the Clinton email investigation. In his initial letter saying he was acting on recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he explicitly noted that Mr Comey had informed him ""on three separate occasions"" that he was not personally under investigation in relation to the Russia inquiry. This video can not be played How the White House's story on Comey collapsed From there, things began to unravel. In his first in-person explanation Donald Trump said he fired Comey because he was ""not doing a good job"". He spoke while sitting next to Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's former national security adviser, which made for a bizarre optic given that some comparisons were already being made to the Watergate scandal. Later on Wednesday, Mr Trump also met the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador to Washington in another bit of awkward timing. Nick Bryant: It's not Watergate Photos of the closed-door meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russia's US Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were released by the Russian government Then on Thursday, in an NBC interview, the US president said he had actually alone decided to fire Mr Comey - who he called a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"". He also said that he was thinking about the ""Russia thing"" when he made the decision. Anthony Zurcher: How the White House Comey story collapsed These comments of course contradicted his team's earlier explanations that the recommendation fromMr Rosenstein in particular- painted as a man of integrity and independence - had prompted the firing, rather than any politically-motivated reasoning. On Friday, the president admitted on Twitter there had been inaccurate and conflicting statements, but then angrily suggested that all White House press briefings should be cancelled for ""accuracy"". In his NBC interview the US president also described a January dinner with James Comey at which he was told he was not under investigation. He said Mr Comey had requested the dinner because he wanted to keep his FBI job. The New York Times is also reporting that the president asked Mr Comey for a pledge of loyalty - and he said no. The White House denies the story. Katty Kay: Is Trump's thin skin to blame? It's unlikely that Mr Comey will not eventually respond to Mr Trump's assertions, and the stage is set for further dramatic confrontation as the president has suggested he might have recorded their conversations. He tweeted on Friday: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" In front of the TV cameras hours later, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer wouldn't comment on whether the president is recording conversations. If we've re-learnt one definite lesson this week, it's that it's not easy to be a spokesperson for the 45th president. Trump interview takeaways The shifting explanations Trump's Comey clarification.

Nicola Adams v Maryan Salazar,"Kal Yafai retains WBA super-flyweight title in Birmingham Briton beat Japan's Suguru Maranaka on points Nicola Adams beats Maryan Salazar in second pro fight Adams stops Mexican in third round to delight of her home fans in Leeds Josh Warrington beats Kiko Martinez (WBC international featherweight) Michael Emons, Kal Sajad and Shamoon Hafez So that concludes a very hectic night of British boxing. We hadÂNicola Adams stopping Maryan Salazarin the third round of Adams' Leeds homecoming and then wins forKal Yafai and Josh Warrington. Yafai's points victory means he retains his WBA Super-Flyweight World Championship, while Warrington moves closer to a world title shot of his own in the featherweight category. It has been frantic, but it has been fun. Thanks for joining us and bye for now. Josh Warrington beats Kiko Martinez with a majority decision Josh Warrington's promoter Frank Warren tells BT Sport: ""I am astonished John Keane gave it a draw. ""Josh needed those rounds under his belt and we have got to look to get him a world title fight. We should look to do that in the next six months and I am going to work hard to deliver that."" Some quotes fromJosh Warrington,who has won in his first fight in 10 months. He tells BT Sport: ""I felt all right, I felt good. It probably looked I was going through the motions. At times I felt I had him wobbled I never felt tired, at times I just switched off and it was good to get the rounds under my belt. ""I can't thank these fans enough, I owe them so much and that is why I want to get a world title. I always felt in control. ""I think I am ready to go (for a world title). I wanted to stand and trade a bit and I did, but he never troubled me and we go on. ""I kept him busy with my jab, I could have teed him up a bit better, I was trying a few things in there and it feels great to be back."" So Josh Warrington can go on to bigger and better things, but it was a tough, tough test that he has just about got through it. It is tense around the First Direct Arena as the first judge calls it a 114-114 draw, but Josh Warrington's unbeaten run is intact, and he still has the WBC International Featherweight Championship as two judges give it to him by 116-112, 116-112 margins. He wins by a majority decision. Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez So, again, we go to the judges' scorecards. Has Josh Warrington done enough? Round 12: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez The final round... Martinez keeps coming at Warrington and lands a powerful right to the body, followed by the head. The Leeds man is stunned for a second and his Spanish opponent comes back at him but unable to finish the job. Warrington takes a step back to try and regain his composure but he fails to land anything of note in the 12th. The crowd comes to life with 30 seconds to go, but it is another solid Martinez body blow which sneaks through. All over and the two greet each other with a big hug. Round 11: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez The duo go toe-to-toe at the beginning of the 11th as blood drips down Martinez's eye after the cut he suffered by an accidental clash of heads. They are really going for it now as Martinez swings a left hook with Warrington looking tired and weary with little left in the tank. He may need to take the last round to ensure victory here. Kal Yafai beats Suguru Muranaka to retain his WBA Super-Flyweight World Championship Some quotes from Kal Yafai's promoterEddie Hearn.He tells Sky Sports: ""I thought it was a great performance, one more defence then he can chase the unification bouts.""Â Round 10: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez Nicola Adams, looking fresh after her fight, sits ringside to cheer on her fellow Leeds boxer. The short and stocky Martinez again lands with a blow to the body, but Warrington moves quickly on his feet to respond with punches of his own. The referee chats to both men for a couple of hits below the belt, but they touch gloves and return to their stools at the end of the round. Kal Yafai beats Suguru Muranaka to retain his WBA Super-Flyweight Championship Some quotes from Great Britain'sKal Yafai,who has defended his WBA Super-Flyweight Championship with a convincing points win over Japan's tough Suguru Muranaka. Yafai tells Sky Sports: ""I had to box my way through, that kid, boy, his head has everything. ""My hand was in a bad way after two rounds, but I got through it.Â My hands are in agony. ""There is a lot to work on, I'm still a work in progress. I need to work on taking my time but I will watch it back and there will be some positives to take. ""He has a tough head. At the end, he said 'you are strong' but he took everything I had."" It is a unanimous points win for Great Britain's Kal Yafai, and it is a big win. The judges give it to Yafai byÂ 118-108, 119-107 and 119-107 margins Round nine: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez Is that cut going to force Martinez to go to all-out attacking mode? It a deep one and the Spaniard has to set the tempo. But it leaves him exposed and Warrington gets through the defences with a superb right flush on the nose which rocks back Martinez's head. The Lee Carsley lookalike's face is a mess now. Kal Yafai v Suguru Muranaka (WBA Super-Flyweight Championship) He has taken some punishment, but Japan's Suguru Muranaka gets to hear the final bell. Which way will this one go? Round 12: Kal Yafai v Suguru Muranaka Luke Campbell, the Olympic Games bantamweight gold medallist in 2012, has his say... Round eight: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez Warrington needs to be careful. He goes on the attack but a big missed right allows Martinez to catch his man with a clean left hook. ButMartinez is cutwith claret seeping down his right cheek following what looked like a clash of heads. ""Make him look silly now,"" says trainer Sean O'Hagan in the corner. Four more rounds to come. Round 11: Kal Yafai v Suguru Muranaka Can Suguru Muranaka get to hear the final bell? He deserves to. This is the first time he has fought outside of Japan, but he will have gained a lot of friends and admirers for his tenacity, bravery and sheer doggedness. Still, this is Kal Yafai's fight to lose. One round to go. Round seven: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez Body shots is the way to go for Martinez, catching Warrington in the ribcage. But the Leeds fighter holds himself together to club the Spaniard one, two, three times to the right of the head. Both boxers have taken some shots, but seem to be soaking them up well. Round 10: Kal Yafai v Suguru Muranaka This has been a lot tougher for the Birmingham man than many in the Barclaycard Arena in Yafai's home city thought it would be. The Japanese fighter is getting the plaudits for being so tough, but Yafai is keeping hold of his title - unless something special happens in the last nine minutes. Unless something special happens. I remember writing something similar at this stage of Anthony Joshua versus Wladimir Klitschko with the Ukrainian on top and we all know what happened there. Round 6: Josh Warrington v Kiko Martinez ""Marching on together,"" sing the Leeds crowd. Their man dances around the ring to try and evade the right hand hammer of Martinez. The Spaniard is comfortable in taking the shots from Warrington, before striking back by working the body of the Englishman. Warrington then unleashes some heavy artillery late in the round, which Martinez feels for the first time. ""You are giving him a masterclass in boxing,"" says father and trainer Sean O' HaganÂ in the corner. Â© 2025 BBC.

Players Championship - Poulter two off the lead,"Americans JB Holmes & Kyle Stanley lead on -9 after third round at Sawgrass South African Louis Oosthuizen third on -8 South Korea's Si Woo Kim fourth on -7 -6 Ian Poulter, Emiliano Grillo -5 Sergio Garcia, Patrick Cantley, Alex Noren Selected: -3 Scott; -2 Singh; -1 Day, McIlroy Level Rose; +1 Casey, Hatton, Fleetwood, McDowell; +2 D Johnson Alex Bysouth and Mike Henson So JB Holmes and Kyle Stanley head into Sunday's final round with a share of the lead, but there's plenty to play for on day four at Sawgrass. Will one of the leading Americans hold on? Can Louis Oosthuizen close the gap? Or will we see England's Ian Poulter making a beeline for top spot? Perhaps 21-year-old Si Woo Kim will deliver on his undoubted promise? Masters champion Sergio Garcia is lurking, as is Argentina's Emiliano Grillo. It's up for grabs in the Players Championship, so make sure you join us tomorrow to find out who'll come out on top in Florida. Catch you then... Holmes -9 (18) Co-leader JB Holmes explains his round and why he was given a drop at 15. ""The wind was blowing so hard earlier pars were good,"" he told Sky Sports. ""You have to make those par putts, because that was a pretty good score today. ""The speed was just perfect today. I putted well, my putting stroke has felt good all week. ""On 15, my ball was in a hole, it looked like there was a drain down there so I got a relief and got a drop from that. ""I had good vibes going in, I've been able to get around and score. Some holes don't set up perfectly for me, but it's fun to play."" Stanley -9 (18) Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But it's slightly too heavy from the South African, and runs on to the edge of the green on the opposite side to where he started. Kyle Stanley actually ended up on the edge of the sand, he chips on and looks good for par. Oosthuizen goes first, and sinks a fine par from eight foot to remain on eight under. That was confident stuff, straight down the throat of the hole. Can his American counterpart follow suit? Stanley bides his time, and gently rolls that one home in equally as composed fashion.Â He holds on to a share of the lead. Iain CarterBBC golf correspondent at Sawgrass I've
just spoken to Ian Poulter who is brimming with pride after his bogey free 71.
I jokingly suggested 17 pars and one birdie was a bit boring - he laughed at
the notion with justification.Â It was a wonderfully composed and patient round
and the prospect of fighting it out on the leaderboard prompted a two word
response. ""Love it,"" he said. Stanley -9, Oosthuizen -8 (17) Sawgrass falls momentarily silent as Kyle Stanley stands over his ball on the fairway and then clips a three-wood towards the green. The tranquility of a Florida evening is broken as a cheer starts to rise from the fans behind the flag, but that slips into groans as it skips on into the longer fringes around the smooth stuff. No such vocal recognition for Louis Oosthuizen, although his ball takes a similar trajectory as the South African also fails to make the green. Holmes -9, Singh +1 (18) JB Holmes had pulled his tee shot slightly right, but found the green with his second. He first putt looks a little heavy, that slides right past the hole from the top of the green and nestles five feet or so away from the cup. No problem for Holmes, he makes par to stay at nine under par. Playing partner Vijay Singh had a shocker on the 17th, triple-bogeying after finding the water twice, and he finishes on one over. Stanley -9, Oosthuizen -8 (17) Kyle Stanley makes the fairway at the 18th. No hint of a smile from the American though, just a stone cold stare as he watches it skip on for a comfortable lie. Louis Oosthuizen follows him, slightly further left but two good tee shots. Stanley -9, Oosthuizen -8 (17) Confident putting from Louis Oosthuizen on the sometimes troublesome 17th. He sends it down in par to remain on eight under, but it's his playing partner Kyle Stanley who's making moves. Lovely tee shot from the American to stick it within six feet of the pin and he's down in two to make birdie and take a share of the lead. Poulter -6 (18) Ian Poulter has been speaking after his bogey-free third round. ""I wish I had taken a couple of opportunities at the end, a couple that could have gone in and it was a round of golf that could have been lower,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Beforehand I would have taken 71 for sure, it's good golf. I'm happy to be here. Let's hope tomorrow I can take advantage of that. ""It is a big deal to be able to concentrate on just playing golf, working out where you want to play and, when you're on the course, be aggressive towards your targets.""

He's on the green and then down in two to birdie and go nine under par for the tournament. Oosthuizen -8 (16) Unlucky, Louis Oosthuizen.Â With playing partner Kyle Stanley chopping around at the opposite side of the green, the South African almost sinks an eagle opportunity from some 30 feet. It clips the cup, thinks about dropping and then falls inches away from the pin. A tap-in birdie, but Oosthuizen knows it could've been more. It's enough for a share of second place. Stanley -8 (15) Well, they say you need a little luck to be win trophies and Kyle Stanley might just have got it there. He gets his approach shot completely wrong at the 16th and it bounces up towards a grandstand, rebounds and bobbles all the way back down towards the flag before settling in some longer grass behind the green. It's a difficult lie, mind. He'll have to play between a couple of palm trees and anything overhit will run dangerously close to the water... in the end, it doesn't quite creep on to green. -2 (16) Vijay Singh has steadied the ship a little since his round fell apart with a double and triple bogey on the front nine. He was in the mix as the weekend began, but sits on two under through 16. And there's that commentator's curse again. He's in the water at the 17th... Poulter -6 (18) Wonderfully consistent golf from Ian Poulter, who takes par on the 18th to finish on one under for the day and six under for the tournament so far. He's put himself in contention heading into the final day. Holmes -8 (15) What's JB Holmes going to do from here? He saunters round his ball after sending a tee shot into the rough, before returning to his caddy for a quick consultation. ""Hold still everybody,"" goes the call from a steward, before the American strikes. But he's pulled that 40 yards short of the green, and it catches the bottom of a tree and finds a shallow lying bunker. Oosthuizen -7, Stanley -8 (14) Louis Oosthuizen is pacing around his ball on the 15th green. He's got an uphill birdie chance from 15 feet or so, but it never quite catches the line. It settles right, and should be another par for the South African. Kyle Stanley's approach left him much closer to the pin, but with a tricky putt coming up the slope from a different angle. He slaps his thigh as it sails a foot past. Over on 17, Patrick Cantlay almost rushes through his work on the green and drops a shot. Cabrera Bello -3 (15) Rafa Cabrera Bello gives thanks to the longer grass around the fringes of the water hazard that lies besides the green on the 16th. That looked set for the splash, but it holds up. He's had a third round littered with bogeys, and one double, that puts him on three under heading into the final few holes. -8Holmes (15), Stanley (14) -7Oosthuizen (14), Kim (18) -6Poulter (17), Grillo (18), Cantley (16), Noren (16) -5Garcia (18) -4Perez (18), Molinari (18) Full leaderboard,external Â© 2025 BBC.

The ransomware causing chaos globally,"Experts are warning that there could be further ransomware cases this week after the global cyber-attack. So, what has happened and how can organisations and individuals protect themselves from such attacks? Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is ""unprecedented"", according to EU police body Europol. It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend. There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life. In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took. The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments  - $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up. WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk. However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain. You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages. Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre websitecontains advice,externalon how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't. The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. The ransomware has been identified as WannaCry Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised. It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus. In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency. When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction. It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small. Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly. It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The ""kill switch""  that stopped it spreading -accidentally discovered by a security researcher- may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly. Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace. However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace.

The rise of the tweenage vlogger,"Nikki Lilly found a new hobby as a YouTuber when a medical condition caused her to give up swimming and dance Nikki Christou, 12, known in the vlogging world as Nikki Lilly, makes YouTube videos about baking, make-up and a rare medical condition known as arterial venous malformation (AVM), something she was diagnosed with when she was six. Her condition has resulted in a severe facial disfigurement and the constant risk of life-threatening nosebleeds. She doesn't get many ""haters"" on her channel but admits that when she began vlogging, the cruel comments did upset her. ""It definitely got to me at first, and I may have shed a few tears - but, as I've grown as a vlogger, I've learnt that the comments from the haters are basically all the same. This video can not be played WATCH: Justin Escalona's vlogging tips ""They may say things like, 'You are ugly,' but really they don't like themselves and they have nothing better to do."" Nikki currently has more than 200,000 subscribers to her channel and hopes to break the million mark at some point. Making videos started as a hobby, a natural follow-on from the role-playing games she already loved. When she began posting them to YouTube in 2013, she became part of a new generation of tweenagers - children from eight to 13 - who run their own channels. She advises any newbies to ""make sure they always show what they have made to their parents"". At first, Nikki's parents, worried by the reaction she might receive, insisted that the comments section was turned off. But her mother says that once they saw how much it meant to Nikki and how much she craved feedback, they changed their minds. Many young girls are blogging about beauty and most of them are ""pretty and thin"", according to one academic Shauna Pomerantz, associate professor at the department of child and youth studies at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, says Nikki is a great role model for young girls. ""She is the champion of the not-perfect girl, and she is absolutely inspirational to watch,"" she told the BBC. ""I can see why people love her - she is a hero to anyone who feels like an outsider."" Across the pond, 13-year-old American dancer and singer JoJo Siwa vlogs about much the same thing as Nikki Lilly, although, with more than three million followers, she is better established. There are, says Prof Pomerantz, thousands of similar girls on YouTube and they are ""mostly white, upper-class, pretty and thin"". Prof Pomerantz's own nine-year-old daughter is a mega-fan of JoJo's, and while her daughter doesn't know why she likes her so much, her mother thinks there are two main reasons. ""Firstly, this is a world where no adults are visible and it is fantastic for children to see a world where kids are in charge."" Zoe Sugg - who now writes books as well as vlogging - has become the godmother of the beauty vlog, with 11 million subscribers The second reason is likely to be the normalcy of the videos. ""This stuff is really very mundane,"" Prof Pomerantz says. ""Any adult watching would be bored within seconds. ""These vloggers invite their fans on closet tours, show them how to do a high ponytail, show them their underwear."" And this means children can relate to these ""stars"" in ways a previous generation could not, says Prof Pomerantz. Gone are the days when celebrities were one step removed, in the pages of a glossy magazine or on the set of a TV programme - now children are quite literally invited to look around their bedrooms. Nikki Lilly is a huge fan of Zoella, who, at the grand old age of 27, is a veteran of the beauty vlog. She says she loves her because ""she is like a chatty girl next door"". But Zoella, like other celebrity vloggers, has another secret to her success, a willingness to share her vulnerability with her fans - in her case, crippling anxiety. Are young people becoming too image conscious because of social media? Much has been written about how the YouTube generation are growing up with no privacy - willing to share on social media every detail of their lives, but Prof Pomerantz is not overly concerned. ""While their mothers may have kept a diary under lock and key, now there is a different way of sharing secrets and young people are happy to tell the world,"" she says. ""In some ways, this is a form of empowerment. ""Young people are more likely to be open and honest."" Journalist Zoe Williams worries, though, that YouTube could be spawning a generation of egotists. Writing about Zoella in the Guardian,externalnewspaper, she says: ""Her delight in the inconsequential is perversely infectious; there is something rather relaxing about the company of a person who will say out loud anything that pops into their head."" But, she adds: ""The depth of her fascination with herself is also rather alienating."" There is no shortage of children desperate to mimic their YouTube heroes and start their own vlogs - but, for the vast majority, stardom is unlikely to follow. Amanda Lenhart, a senior research scientist at the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, says for those who do not get many followers, it is simply a valuable life lesson. Justin Escalona uploads a new vlog every day ""It is not pleasant, but is it any different from wanting to be a professional football player and finding you are not good enough? It is part of growing up,"" she says. Justin Escalona, 20, who started a YouTube channel with his friends when he was 11, has some advice for children wanting to do the same. ""I think having an outlet for young kids to express their creativity is a positive thing,"" he says. ""Just don't put stupid or inappropriate stuff online and don't worry about getting views."" Now a film student, his vlogs have morphed into slick, cinematic affairs, but he advises children against feeling the need to always be ""camera-ready"". ""Just be genuine,"" he says. ""If you're faking the best version of yourself, it will show over time. ""If you're sharing your genuine high points, along with maybe your not-so-high points, people will respect and like you for being real."" Top vlogging tips from Wales' stars.

SportAberdeen 1-3 Celtic12 May 2017 (21:37:56),"Champions Celtic scored three times in a blistering opening 11 minutes to overcome Aberdeen at Pittodrie and move to within two games of completing an unbeaten Scottish Premiership season. Dedryck Boyata headed Celtic in front in three minutes, with Stuart Armstrong doubling the lead five minutes later. Leigh Griffiths fired in a third, before Jonny Hayes gave the Dons hope with a curling shot within 60 seconds. But the hosts could not to stop Celtic taking their points tally to 100. This video can not be played Aberdeen 1-3 Celtic: Derek McInnes and Brendan Rodgers post-match interviews Derek McInnes' side may look back ruefully at referee Steven McLean's decision not to award them a penalty when Craig Gordon collided with Graeme Shinnie. But they will likely also reflect on their slow start to a fantastic contest, with Celtic apparently out of sight within 11 minutes. Patrick Roberts signalled an early warning when he escaped and tested Joe Lewis, but that was not heeded and Griffiths' deep corner was headed in by an unchallenged Boyata. Wonderful Griffiths skill created the second, the striker escaping on the right and feeding Callum McGregor. His shot was blocked by Shay Logan, but Armstrong was on hand to slam in a composed finish. It quickly got even worse for Aberdeen. Griffiths turned, fired powerfully from distance and found the net, although Lewis should have done better than help the ball into his top-right corner. Dedryck Boyata opens the scoring after just three minutes It was a devastating start from the champions and the game looked finished. Aberdeen boss McInnes must have feared his side were on course for a damaging hammering in the run up to their meeting with Celtic in the Scottish Cup final. But the Dons showed remarkable strength and ability to claw their way back in. Hayes was the inspiration for a revival when he turned and fired a wonderful left foot shot over Gordon and into the net. Jayden Stockley should have netted a second moments later but his header slid marginally wide. Aberdeen pressed on with confidence and Niall McGinn could only hit straight at Gordon from a great position. It could have been 3-3, or 5-3, with both sides looking likely to score again. Shinnie claimed for a penalty when he nicked the ball before Gordon took him out but referee McLean said no, much to Aberdeen's fury. It looked a spot-kick and could have made such a difference. It was mainly Aberdeen pushing forward in the second period. Kenny McLean should have hit the target when he broke into the box but fired off-target, as did McGinn shortly after. Leigh Griffiths took his goals tally to 16 for the season With the home side unable to turn pressure into goals, Nir Bitton's introduction for Celtic seemed to take the sting out of the game in the latter stages. Both teams have much to ponder before coming together again at Hampden Park; positives and negatives. Aberdeen looked all over the place defensively in the early stages, but responded strongly and caused Celtic problems. From that, they will take great belief. Celtic manager Rodgers will be disappointed at how things panned out after that clinical opening period. His side failed to control long periods of the contest and had to absorb a lot of pressure, which they did, but more than was comfortable. However, the champions did demonstrate that when they fire, they are pretty much unstoppable.
