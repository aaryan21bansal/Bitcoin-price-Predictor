Cancer survival in the UK 'lagging behind',"Cancer survival in the UK is on the up, but is still lagging behind other high-income countries, analysis suggests. Five-year survival rates for rectal and colon cancer improved the most since 1995, and pancreatic cancer the least. Advances in treatment and surgery are thought to be behind the UK's progress. But the UK still performed worse than Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway,the study in Lancet Oncology,externalfound. Cancer Research UK said the UK could do better and called for more ""investment in the NHS and the systems and innovations that support it"". The research looked at data on nearly four million patients with seven types of cancer - oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung and ovary - from seven high-income countries. The cancer patients were all diagnosed between 1995 and 2014. The estimated survival rates of people diagnosed with cancer increased in all seven countries over the period studied, from 1995-2014. But some countries did better than others. Australia was found to have higher survival rates than other countries, while the UK on the whole had lower survival rates. In fact, despite improvements, the UK is the worst for key cancers including lung, colon, rectum, stomach and pancreas. The 20 years of failure on cancer Cancer waiting times 'at worst level ever' The worst places for cancer care waits revealed Survival rates for stomach cancer In the UK, rectal cancer survival went up from 48% to 62% over 20 years. For colon cancer, there was good progress too - from 47% surviving for five years in 1995-99 to 59% in 2010-14. In comparison, Ireland made similar improvements, and Denmark even greater ones. Australia's survival increased to 71% for both rectal and colon cancer. Pancreatic cancer had the lowest five-year survival of all - ranging from 7.9% in the UK (lowest) to 14.6% in Australia (highest). Cancer survival rates in UK compared to other countries For lung cancer, Canada had the highest five-year survival (21.7%) while the UK had the lowest (14.7%). All countries had similar improvements in survival from stomach cancer, while Norway saw the highest five-year survival for ovarian cancer (46%). The improvements were better for the under-75s than the over-75s. The researchers say steady improvements by all countries in the study are probably due to major healthcare reforms and advances in technology, which have led to earlier diagnosis, more effective treatments and better managing of patients. Bowel (rectal and colon) had one of the largest increases in five-year survival. John Butler, consultant surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London and Cancer Research UK's clinical adviser, said this was due to better surgical techniques, greater use of radiotherapy and more older patients being treated. He added that improvements in the UK were the result of a combination of many different factors. Cancer treatments are improving across high-income countries, the study found ""Over the last 20 years we've seen improvements in cancer planning, development of national cancer strategies and the rollout of new diagnostic and treatment services. ""For lung, ovarian, and oesophageal cancer in particular, survival has increased largely because the quality of surgery has radically improved, and more surgery is taking place than before. ""More people are being looked after by specialist teams, rather than surgeons who aren't experts in that area."" Mr Butler said investing in early diagnosis and cancer care would play a big part in closing the survival gap on other countries. The UK government said other data showed that one-year survival rates in England, for all types of cancer, were at a record high. One-year survival has increased from 62% in 2001 to 72.8% in 2016. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high, but we are determined to go further and save even more lives. ""Through our NHS Long Term Plan, we will detect more cancers at an earlier stage, saving an estimated 55,000 lives a year. ""Alongside this, the record Â£33.9 billion extra a year we're investing in our NHS will help support the health service in recruiting the staff it needs for the future."" An NHS England spokeswoman said the report was out of date and pointed to improved survival rates. She said this was ""thanks to improvements in NHS cancer services, including the introduction of revolutionary treatments like proton beam therapy and immunotherapy"". The latest NHS data for cancer waiting times in shows hospitals are continuing to miss their target to see patients quickly. The NHS in England is meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral by a GP. But currently nearly one in four patients wait longer, according to figures released on Thursday. The other parts of the UK are also struggling to hit their targets.

Hospitals need way out of 'toxic' NHS mortgages,"The NHS needs to be given a legal right to buy out ""toxic"" deals hospitals have agreed for new buildings, experts say. More than 100 schemes were signed off over the past 20 years in England under PFI contracts where private firms paid for new hospitals and centres. In return, NHS trusts have to make annual repayments like a mortgage. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said some of the fees were extortionate - and with Â£55bn still owed, action was needed. Chris Thomas, a health fellow at the think tank, said the worst deals were the equivalent of taking out a mortgage from a ""loan shark charging high rates of interest that could not be renegotiated"". He said while the government had banned the use of PFI in 2018, the NHS was ""still left with the toxic legacy of some bad deals with little way out."" Only two trusts are known to have escaped from them. ""The contracts are still driving billions away from patients and into private bank accounts, blocking transformation and threatening even basic safety standards in our hospitals,"" added Mr Thomas. The IPPR said not all the deals were bad, but its research had found some trusts were paying a sixth of their income in fees, with high charges for maintenance and services as well as high rates of interest pushing up costs. By 2050, Â£80bn is expected to have been paid in fees for Â£13bn worth of buildings. The IPPR wants a legal right to be created to allow the NHS to buy out the contracts at a fair price - similar to the way leaseholders can buy the freeholds for their homes. One of the trusts that left its PFI - Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust - managed to save over Â£3m a year in repayments, reducing its financial liability by a third. PFI has been used in other parts of the UK for NHS schemes, but not on the scale seen in England. One of the key problems - even if trusts can get out of the contracts - is financing the buy-out. Northumbria borrowed money from the local council, but the lower value of that contract and the size of that council made it possible in a way that is not everywhere. The IPPR said the money to buy out contracts could come from the NHS capital budget - the government has recently announced an increase in this budget, although the think tank said significantly that more would still be needed. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, said the option to buy out contracts would be welcome - although there were some examples of good-value contracts. But she said she was not sure the funds would be available to allow this, despite the fact some deals were ""badly designed"". The Department of Health and Social Care said there were no plans to introduce a right-to-buy scheme, but the extra money being invested in the NHS over the coming years would ensure ""world-class care"" could be delivered.

"Ban children from gambling in games, MPs say","In-game spending should be regulated by gambling laws and so-called loot boxes banned entirely for children, MPs say. The industry's UK trade body responded it would ""review these recommendations with utmost seriousness"". But the committee of MPs had accused some of those who had given evidence of a ""lack of honesty and transparency"". Free video games often encourage players to buy virtual loot boxes, which contain an unspecified amount of items to improve further game-play. Some games have associated online marketplaces where players can trade or sell these items. Have your say: Should loot boxes be banned? 'My son spent Â£3,160 in one game' EA games: Loot boxes aren't gambling, they're just like a Kinder Egg Loot boxes should be banned, says US senator The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee's inquiry into addictive and immersive technologies heard stories of young adults who had built up debts of thousands of pounds through spending in games. Jagex, the company behind online game RuneScape, admitted players could spend up to Â£1,000 a week or Â£5,000 a month. But the MPs found the industry was reluctant to accept responsibility for intervening when a player was over-spending or even to put a figure on how much was too much. And some had been ""wilfully obtuse"" in answering questions about game-play, which MPs needed to know in order to better understand how players engaged with games. Without naming names, they said they had sometimes found it difficult to get full and clear answers from the gaming industry representatives who had appeared before them, in particular when it came to answering questions about what data they collected, how it was used and the psychology underpinning how games were designed. ""Social media platforms and online games makers are locked in a relentless battle to capture ever more of people's attention, time and money,"" Mr Collins said. ""Their business models are built on this but it's time for them to be more responsible in dealing with the harms these technologies can cause for some users."" In response Dr Jo Twist, the chief executive of UK Interactive Entertainment, said: """"The video games industry has always, and will continue to, put the welfare of players at the heart of what we do. ""The industry does not dispute that, for a minority, finding balance is a problem. ""This is why we are vocal in supporting efforts to increase digital literacy and work with schools and carers on education programmes."" But Mr Collins said the games industry should contribute financially towards independent research into the long-term effects of gaming. ""Gaming disorder based on excessive and addictive game-play has been recognised by the World Health Organization,"" he said. ""It's time for game companies to use the huge quantities of data they gather about their players to do more to proactively identify vulnerable gamers."" The MPs also called for both social media platforms and game-makers to establish effective age-verification tools. Currently both rely on a honesty system and, as a result, there are large numbers of under-age users on social media and playing games. Loot boxes offer a variety of rewards that can improve game-play Loot boxes should not be sold to children and should instead be earned as rewards for game-play, the MPs said. ""Loot boxes are particularly lucrative for games companies but come at a high cost, particularly for problem gamblers, while exposing children to potential harm,"" Mr Collins said. ""Buying a loot box is playing a game of chance and it is high time the gambling laws caught up. ""We challenge the government to explain why loot boxes should be exempt from the Gambling Act."" There is growing international disquiet about loot boxes, with a US senator calling for them to be banned and the government of Belgium ruling they were in violation of gambling laws. China has restricted the number of loot boxes players can open each day. Sweden is also investigating them.

Children's hospital delayed until autumn next year,"An artist's impression of how the new hospital would look The new children's hospital in Edinburgh won't be fully operational for at least another year, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has revealed. The Sick Kids facility was due to open in July, butlast-minute inspections found safety concernsover its ventilation systems. Now a new report has found at least Â£16m worth of work is needed. NHS Lothian is payingabout Â£1.4m in monthly repaymentsto the private consortium which built the facility. An independent review of the governance arrangements for the new hospital found that the main issue with ventilation in critical care stemmed from an error in a document produced by NHS Lothian at the tender stage in 2012. It found that this was human error relating to confusion over interpretation of building standards and guidance, and that opportunities to spot and rectify the error were missed. Ms Freeman said it was ""unacceptable"" that the hospital could not be delivered on time and revealed a troubleshooter would be brought in to help manage the project. She added: ""The safest possible care of their children is my overriding priority and I am sorry for any impact the current situation has had on them. ""I am of course bitterly disappointed that a mistake made in 2012 was not picked up earlier. ""This is a publicly funded project of strategic importance, which has not been delivered by NHS Lothian in compliance with the standards and guidance. ""The delay we now face will be borne by NHS Lothian staff, by patients and their families and the additional cost will be to the public purse."" The new hospital has faced a number of delays and disagreements between the contractors and NHS Lothian The Scottish government revealed that at least Â£16m was needed to rectify the problems, such as ventilation, at the new building. The ventilation issue affects the critical care unit, as previously revealed, but also the oncology and haematology departments. Some remedial and precautionary action is recommended for water systems, though no widespread contamination was found. In addition, ""active monitoring"" of the building's drainage and plumbing has been recommended but the prospect of problems in this area was graded as ""low risk"". Asked about the cost of keeping the existing Sick Kids hospital open until the new facility is ready, Ms Freeman said this would be between Â£6m and Â£7m. The existing site has been sold to a student housing developer which had expected to have taken possession of the site by now. Two reviews into the Sick Kids delay were ordered by Ms Freeman, one by accountancy giant KPMG and another by the National Services Scotland (NSS) division of the NHS. The findings include: One of the original tender documents issued by NHS Lothian to bidders stated single bed cubicles and four-bed rooms in the critical care ward required a ventilation system with four air changes per hour. However, the relevant guidance states 12 changes per hour are needed for this type of hospital ward. At the time of the project's financial close in 2015, the KPMG report states ""designs for the hospital had not been fully developed"". This included issues relating to the design of the ventilation systems. Independent contractors testing the ventilation in the hospital's critical care wards first flagged the air change problem to NHS Lothian on 24 June. The next day consortium IHSL said the issues could be resolved. However, by 1 July it had been established that the ventilation system was not capable of ten air changes per hour.  The delay to opening was announced on 4 July. The new hospital has a helipad on its roof but NSS found no testing has been carried out to assess what impact the downdraft from helicopters would have given that air intakes and windows are sited in the courtyard below. NHS Lothian said it has shared modelling of the impact with NSS and will now undertake test flights on the helipad. Ms Freeman said that ""due to the scale of the challenge"" a senior programme director will take over responsibility from NHS Lothian to deliver the project. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""The taxpayer will have to fork out more than Â£30m between now and next autumn to compensate for these catastrophic failings. ""Staff and families alike will also be sceptical about whether this hospital will be open by next autumn. ""They've been promised - year after year - that new timescales will be adhered to, and they've been repeatedly let down."" Staff were ready to leave the old Sick Kids hospital in July The new Sick Children's Hospital cost about Â£150m to build, but its full price tag over the next 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, will be Â£432m. Under the terms of the contract, repayments - which would average about Â£1.4m a month - began in February when NHS Lothian took possession of the site from private consortium IHSL. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said: ""Someone signed off this new hospital when it was clearly not safe or in a fit state for use by our children. That raises the question for who is responsible and liable for this mess.""

Trump plans ban on sale of flavoured e-cigarettes,"This video can not be played 'I felt helpless to stop my son's addiction': Kristen wants vaping companies held accountable US President Donald Trump has announced that his administration will ban flavoured e-cigarettes, after a spate of vaping-related deaths. Mr Trump told reporters vaping was a ""new problem"", especially for children. US Health Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would finalise a plan to take all non-tobacco flavours off the market. There have been six deaths and 450 reported cases of lung illness tied to vaping across 33 states. Many of the 450 reported cases are young people, with an average age of 19. Michigan this month became the first US state to ban flavoured e-cigarettes. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? Joining Mr Trump at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Azar said it would take the FDA several weeks to distribute the new guidance on e-cigarettes. This video can not be played President Donald Trump: 'People are dying with vaping' He also said the agency would take enforcement action if it determined children were being intentionally attracted to e-cigarettes. US First Lady Melania Trump this week tweeted that she was ""deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump told reporters his administration would implement strong rules to protect ""innocent children"", including his 13-year-old son Barron. ""We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected,"" he said. ""That's how the first lady got involved. She's got a son, together, that is a beautiful young man and she feels very, very strongly about it. ""She's seen it. We're both reading it, a lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely."" He added that he hoped the announcement would make parents become ""tougher"". ""People are going to watch what we're saying and parents are going be a lot tougher with respect to their children,"" said the president. ""A lot of people think vaping is wonderful, it's great. It's really not wonderful."" Juul 'ignored law' in US e-cigarette adverts In a press release shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, the health secretary said officials ""will not stand idly by"" as a generation becomes addicted to nicotine. Acting FDA Commissioner Dr Ned Sharpless said ""if we see a migration to tobacco-flavored products by kids, we will take additional steps to address youth use of these products"". E-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul have been blamed for fuelling childhood addiction through flavoured products such as mango, cream or cinnamon roll. Juul, which dominates the market, last year stopped selling most of its flavoured devices in order to defuse mounting criticism. Health officials are still investigating whether a particular toxin or substance is causing the vaping-related illnesses, or whether it's the result of heavy usage. The first death occurred in Illinois in late August. Since then, five more have died and hundreds have been sickened across 33 states. The cause of the vaping illness has not yet been pinpointed by health officials. THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, was present in some, but not all of the devices used by those who fell ill, say authorities. The FDA has said many of the products were found to contain significant amounts of vitamin E acetate, an oil used to thicken the vaping liquid. Several patients have been found with lipoid pneumonia, which occurs when someone inhales fats or oils. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US?

Oxford top of global university rankings,"Oxford University has been ranked first in an international league table for the fourth year in a row. The annualTimes Higher Education world rankings,externalput Cambridge in third place and Imperial College London in tenth. But there is a warning from the compilers of the rankings that other UK universities are ""struggling to hold their own"" against global rivals. They warn Germany is ""poised to overtake"" the UK in having the most top universities in Europe. The rankings show Oxford once again named as the best university in the world, ahead of a US university - the California Institute of Technology - in second place. US universities continue to dominate the rankings, taking seven of the top 10 places and 60 out of the top 200. The Technical University of Munich: German universities have been among the biggest risers in the rankings Asian university systems are catching up - with China and Japan continuing to perform strongly in the rankings. Baghdad University makes global ranking What's the best university when you're looking for a job? Universities challenged over league table claims in adverts Iran's universities are among the ""biggest climbers"" in this year's league table. The full list is of 1,300 universities in 92 countries, with the rankings taking into account teaching quality, the volume and reputation of research, citations of research, income from industry and international links. An analysis accompanying the rankings says that the UK's so-called ""golden triangle"" - Oxford, Cambridge and London universities - continues to be very successful. But it warns that this is ""masking"" a relative decline for other UK universities, while German universities are rapidly improving in the league table. Since 2016, the number of UK universities in the top 200 has fallen from 34 to 28, while the number of German universities has risen by three to 23. The analysis from the Times Higher Education says this could reflect higher levels of investment being put into Germany's university system. Cambridge University, part of the ""golden triangle"", was ranked in third place It also warns that UK universities could fall further behind Germany in funding if they lose access to EU research partnerships after Brexit. ""If the UK starts to withdraw from the international stage, its position in the upper echelons of the rankings will suffer,"" says Phil Baty of the Times Higher Education rankings. The vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, said: ""Oxford's success is in large part due to our research collaborations with other excellent universities around the world and we remain determined both to deepen and to expand these partnerships, whatever Brexit brings.""

School bans skirts to 'protect girls' modesty',"The new uniform will be rolled out to all years from September 2020 A school criticised for banning skirts on modesty grounds has defended its policy. Stowmarket High School in Suffolk introduced a new uniform policy amid concerns over glass-sided stairwells. A school newsletter informed parents that, ""with modesty in mind"", skirts were no longer considered appropriate. Headteacher Dave Lee-Allan said the reference to modesty was an ""error"" but claimed the new uniform was ""more affordable and smarter"". Headteacher Dave Lee-Allan said the reference to ""modesty"" had been a mistake According to theEast Anglian Daily Times,external, some parents accused the school of ""cracking down on girls's behaviour and trying to enforce a ""gender-neutral"" dress code. The policy states all year groups must wear the new uniform when the new building opens next September. The ban on skirts has been discussed on Facebook with some parents critical of the move and others supporting it. Mr Lee-Allan said he thought the glass-sided stairwells could have been another reason for moving away from skirts, but the contractors had assured him this would not be an issue. He said mentioning modesty in the newsletter was ""my error, hands up"". ""For years a number of schools in the region have had this particular uniform policy. We have consulted and a group of parents came in and we looked at different options and then asked students and then published our proposals. ""But we can not make all the people happy."" The new uniform includes a blazer, white shirt, clip-on tie, black shoes and black belt The new uniform also includes a black blazer with the school's logo on it, a white shirt, a clip-on tie, black shoes, a black belt and black or white shirts.

Release of Parliament suspension documents blocked,"A rise in public disorder, higher food prices and reduced medical supplies are real risks of leaving the EU with no deal, a UK government document says. Ministers have publisheddetails of their Yellowhammer contingency plan,external, after MPs voted to force its release. It outlines a series of ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" for the impact of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the paper confirmed the PM ""is prepared to punish those who can least afford it"". Michael Gove, one of Boris Johnson's senior cabinet colleagues who has been given responsibility for no-deal planning, said ""revised assumptions"" will be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"". However, ministers have blocked the release of communications between No 10 aides about Parliament's suspension. Mr Gove said,externalMPs' request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street were ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Publishing the information, he added, would ""contravene the law"" and ""offend against basic principles of fairness"". Dominic Cummings was one of those named in the request to release communications The government sought to resist the publication of the Operation Yellowhammer document, but lost a vote on the issue in the Commons on Monday, prior to the suspension of Parliament, so it was compelled it to do so. The six-page document, dated 2 August andleaked to the Sunday Times last month, warns of disruption at Dover and other channel crossings for at least three months, an increased risk of public disorder, and some shortages of fresh food. On food, the document says certain types of fresh food supply ""will decrease"" and ""critical dependencies for the food chain"" such as key ingredients ""may be in shorter supply"". It says these factors would not lead to overall food shortages ""but will reduce the availability and choice of products and will increase price, which could impact vulnerable groups"". The document also says low-income groups ""will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel"". The flow of cross-Channel goods could face ""significant disruption lasting up to six months"". ""Unmitigated, this will have an impact on the supply of medicines and medical supplies,"" it says. ""The reliance of medicines and medical products' supply chains on the short straits crossing make them particularly vulnerable to severe extended delays."" Among its other key points are: Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK Lorries could have to wait more than two days to cross the Channel Some businesses will cease trading There will be a growth in the black market Some providers of adult social care could fail The document also warns of potential clashes if foreign fishing vessels enter British territorial waters on the day after the UK's departure and says economic difficulties could be ""exacerbated"" by flooding or a flu pandemic this winter. The BBC's Chris Mason said some of the scenarios outlined were ""stark"", but ministers were insisting the paper was not a prediction about what will happen. The document, which, until now, was categorised as ""official, sensitive"", is not an official cabinet paper. It dates from 10 days after Mr Johnson became prime minister. Retailers said the document confirmed what they have been saying will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""Fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise,"" Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium said. And the British Medical Association described the Yellowhammer file as ""alarming"" and that it confirmed its warnings about no-deal, including the threat of medical supply shortages. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said: ""These documents confirm the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, which Labour has worked so hard to block. ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence."" Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful How does prorogation happen? What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? MPs voted on Monday to order the release of all internal correspondence and communications, including e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages, between nine No 10 advisers relating to Parliament's suspension. But the government has said it will not comply with the MPs' request, citing potential legal breaches of data protection and employment rights. This is not an ""old"" Yellowhammer assessment, as was claimed by the government in August. It is from the latest internal no-deal planning, from August, from well within the time of Boris Johnson's administration. The government hopes that its recent efforts will change some of the most concerning aspects of what is titled a ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" document, but they are yet to be able to make those changes. Everything hinges on the core assumption made about disruption to freight traffic across the Channel - that over half would be stuck for up to two and a half days. Those assumptions on trade flow have improved recently, but are still poor, and enough to have several highly concerning consequences, from fresh food supply, to stability in Northern Ireland, to social care providers and supplies of medicines for people and animals. I have also been assured that a widely circulated version of this document, from the same day, had the phrase ""base scenario"". It is somewhat confusing that there can be a base case of a worst case planning assumption. In any event, these are the real, plausible short-term shocks from a no-deal Brexit. The section on Northern Ireland is particularly concerning. In many respects it is incredible to have such a list of the plausible consequences of what is government policy. It is not difficult to see why the government resisted its release. It is unlikely to improve the mood of an already sceptical Commons. But it is really the first tangible, quotable, warts and all assessment of what Whitehall fears could be around the corner. Mr Gove said the legal advice received by Mr Johnson before requesting the prorogation of Parliament was in the public domain after being disclosed as part of the ongoing court cases, but there was no justification for the ""far broader"" information being sought. ""To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of Parliament under this procedure. ""These individuals have no right of reply, and the procedure used fails to afford them any of the protections that would properly be in place. ""It offends against basic principles of fairness and the Civil Service duty of care towards its employees,"" he said. He said it was ministers, not civil servants or special advisers, who were ultimately accountable to Parliament for decisions taken. The request, therefore was ""inappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals"". Correction 2nd October 2019: An earlier version of this story suggested the Yellowhammer document had referred to the potential risk of rioting; it has been amended to more closely reflect the paper's exact wording, which referred to protests and ""a rise in public disorder and community tensions"".

Sinn FÃ©in 'could get more' from Â£1.5m donor's will,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in 'could get more' from Â£1.5m donor's will. Photo credit: Sunday World. Friends of a man who left Â£1.5m to Sinn FÃ©in have said the party could get even more money from his will. Englishman Billy Hampton, 82, left the money to hit back at the British establishment, according to his friends. It is understood to bethe largest ever known donation to a Northern Ireland political party. The money was bequeathed by the former market trader, who died in Pembrokeshire, Wales. ""He got it into his head that the establishment was out to get him,"" said Dave Morton, 71, a friend of Mr Hampton's, from Suffolk. ""It probably was all in his head, but he left the money to Sinn FÃ©in to basically say 'up you' to the British establishment."" Sinn FÃ©in vice president Michelle O'Neillhas said there is ""nothing to see here"" after the party was given the donation. The party said it has complied with all Electoral Commission rules and regulations. Dave Morton said Mr Hampton left the money to say ""up you"" to the British establishment Billy Hampton's late father, Ted, had extensive business interests in the village of Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire that included property, a transport company and industrial estates, according to Mr Morton. After his father's death in the mid-1980s, Billy inherited some of the money. But according to his friends, Mr Hampton blamed the establishment for his inability to access the full inheritance to which he believed he was entitled. ""He was having problems getting his inheritance, possibly because he had been in a mental hospital, or it could have been for legal reasons we don't know about,"" Mr Morton added. ""In his mind he had been let down by everyone in this country, apart from one or two people who tried to help him."" Friends of Mr Hampton believe Sinn FÃ©in could end up inheriting more than the Â£1.5m they have already received from his will. ""From what we could make out in his letters we received, Billy seemed to have the impression that he should have got Â£7m,"" said Mr Morton. ""He [Billy] was not stupid. He was well-educated and if he thought that, I would not be surprised if he was not close."" Mr Morton said Mr Hampton opted to leave the money to Sinn FÃ©in ""to get the last laugh at the establishment"". Mr Hampton's late father had extensive business interests in the village of Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire ""He is probably laughing in his grave right now. He'll think this is hilarious."" In a letter written from France in 2000, Mr Hampton said: ""Having had mental problems, everyone thinks I am barking mad, a silly Billy goat, and don't believe a word I say or write.  Sorry, it was England that kicked me into the hands of Sinn FÃ©in."" In his early life Mr Hampton worked as a market trader in Rainham, Kent, fixing second hand drills at his stall called ""Bill the Drill"".  Years ago he developed psychiatric problems. After a time in hospital, he adopted a nomadic life, and spent some time in west Cork. He passed way in Wales in 2018, having written his will in 1997. As well as the Sinn FÃ©in donation, Mr Hampton left Â£8,000 to be divided among four other people, including Â£1,000 to the veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner. Mr Skinner said he does not recognise Mr Hampton's name, and unlike Sinn FÃ©in, he has said he will not be accepting the money. Mr Hampton also left Â£1,000 to Dennis Skinner, but the Labour MP has not accepted it According the Probate Registry of Wales, the will was worth Â£2.5m, suggesting another Â£1m worth of assets still have to be dispersed. The balance could end up going to Sinn FÃ©in because it remains the executors and the trustees of Mr Hampton's will. In one letter written in France in 2000,  Billy Hampton wrote: ""I am much less paranoid than normal, and do not suffer from a persecution complex at all here in France."" And in the same letter, written three years after he wrote his will, he said: ""Sinn Fein will not speak to me now for security reasons."" So far, Sinn FÃ©in has declined to comment on this or say what it thinks it may have meant.

"House collapses in middle of nightThe gable end of the house fell away, leaving rooms exposed and debris across the street.Coventry & Warwickshire","This video can not be played House collapses in Rugby in middle of night A house collapsed overnight, leaving rooms exposed and debris and possessions strewn across a street. The gable end of the property in Claremont Road, Rugby, Warwickshire fell down at about 02:00 BST. The family who lives there were away at the time and were placed in a hotel after the collapse, but have now been found council accommodation. One man, who lives opposite the property, said it was ""lucky"" no one was in the house at the time. Martin Flowers was leaving his home at about 16:00 BST on Tuesday when he said he saw an initial collapse at the house which sent ""dust up and down"" the street. When he returned at 19:00, he said, the road was closed. ""Now half the house is down,"" he said. ""You can see the furniture and everything in their bedroom."" Martin Flowers said he can see the damage from his front door Lisa Anslow, who lives nearby added: ""It wasn't too obvious from the front exterior of the property, obviously there were police and the area was cordoned off so I knew something had happened and I'd noticed pictures on Facebook. ""You can now see into the actual property from the inside which is quite devastating for the family that live there."" Martin Pitcher, from Life Investments Estate Agency which manages the property, said it had arranged for the family to stay in a hotel and, because they are unable to get into their home, steps are being taken to help them. ""They are not able to access the site, so we are making sure they have all the basic amenities they need to try and take away some of the pain,"" he said. The family has been moved to temporary accommodation Mr Pitcher said construction work had been taking place on the site next to the house, but the cause of the collapse is not yet known.

School bans skirts to 'protect girls' modesty'Stowmarket High School in Suffolk has told new Year 7 pupils they will have to wear trousers.Suffolk,"The new uniform will be rolled out to all years from September 2020 A school criticised for banning skirts on modesty grounds has defended its policy. Stowmarket High School in Suffolk introduced a new uniform policy amid concerns over glass-sided stairwells.

Mr Lee-Allan said he thought the glass-sided stairwells could have been another reason for moving away from skirts, but the contractors had assured him this would not be an issue. He said mentioning modesty in the newsletter was ""my error, hands up"". ""For years a number of schools in the region have had this particular uniform policy.

Lost laws: what's been dropped?,"Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament means 12 high-profile government bills have been lost, including a law protecting victims of domestic abuse and key pieces of post-Brexit legislation. When Parliament is prorogued all existing bills making their way through the Commons and Lords are dropped, unless the government chooses to carry them over to the next session. Only three pieces of legislation were carried over, meaning laws setting up post-Brexit arrangements for immigration, fishing, trade and agriculture as well as bills reforming divorce law, introducing tougher sentencing for animal cruelty and protecting public toilets all fell. The bills can be re-introduced after Parliament returns on 14 October if the government chooses to do so but all progress made is lost and MPs and peers must start their scrutiny from scratch. Parliament is shut until 14 October There are five Brexit-related bills that have dropped off, some of which were seen as important preparation for Brexit day, particularly in a no-deal scenario. They cover trade, immigration, agriculture, financial services and fisheries. Trade Bill Having entered Parliament in 2017, the Trade Bill would have given the UK the powers to implement new trade deals and set up a Trades Remedies Authority. It had been through months of debate and re-writes in both Houses but stalled at the final hurdle after the House of Lords had approved changes that the government could have been defeated on in the Commons. Because this bill was near the end of its parliamentary journey, it couldn't have been carried over, meaning the government either had to pass it or lose it. Fisheries Bill New fishing rules will need to be established after Brexit Shadow fisheries minister Luke Pollard said the Fisheries Bill was a ""day one necessity"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit and that there is no chance of passing the necessary legislation due to prorogation. He called the loss of progress ""a betrayal of coastal communities"". Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers - who was responsible for the Agriculture and Fisheries bills - told a House of Commons committee on Monday that she was ""enthusiastic about reintroducing them soon"".

Maddy Thimont Jack, senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said ""workarounds"" would mean the Brexit bills would not be needed immediately in a no-deal scenario but that these would only ""plug the gaps"" and the legislation would be needed ""pretty soon"". The National Farmers' Union called the fall of the Agriculture Bill as ""totally unreasonable"", adding that there is now ""no guarantee at all that the legislation will be in place to enable the government to begin its planned transition to a new farm support system in 2021"". With a general election on the horizon, Parliament will be closed again. The Brexit bills will either need to be passed quickly - limiting scrutiny - or face another delay. ""Totally unreasonable"" - NFU has criticised the fall of the Agriculture Bill Animal cruelty Another bill lost would have increased the maximum penalty for animal cruelty from six months imprisonment to five years in England and Wales. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland already have laws to this effect. Battersea Dogs & Cats Home said they are ""very disappointed"" the bill has fallen and urge the government to lay it as soon as the Commons returns. Divorce law A planned reform to divorce law in England and Wales would allowed couples who have drifted apart to start immediate divorce proceedings. Currently, unless allegations of fault are made couples must wait two or five years to officially separate. Former Justice Secretary David Gauke said it would end the ""blame game"" and encourage amicable separations that were less disruptive to families. Allow Twitter content?

Domestic Abuse Bill A bill with cross-party support would have introduced a definition of domestic abuse to help victims and the public understand what type of behaviour it constitutes, helping more come forward. Before it was dropped, multiple charities wrote to the PM urging him to keep the Domestic Abuse Bill as part of his agenda. It was at the start of its parliamentary journey, so not much progress has been lost. But Women's Aid has now demanded a ""clear, public commitment"" that the legislation will be brought back after prorogation. Campaigns and public affairs manager Lucy Hadley said: ""Survivors and domestic abuse experts have put years of work into creating this bill - it must be re-introduced in the next Queen's Speech."" Sir James Munby, the former president of the Family Division, expressed his ""dismay and frustration"", saying: ""This is a vitally important bill tackling what everyone agrees is a very great social evil."" He called for the bill to be reintroduced in Parliament as soon as the next session starts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Census Ahead of the 2021 census, a bill that would add to it two voluntary questions on sexual orientation and gender identity in England and Wales has also collapsed.

Dutch doctor cleared in landmark euthanasia case,"Euthanasia was legalised in the Netherlands in 2002 (stock photo) A doctor accused of failing to verify consent before performing euthanasia on a dementia patient has been cleared of any wrongdoing by a Dutch court. The 74-year-old patient, who died in 2016, had expressed a wish to be euthanised but also indicated that she wanted to determine the right time. Judges said the doctor acted lawfully as not carrying out the process would have undermined the patient's wish. It is the first such case since the country legalised euthanasia in 2002. Delivering the verdict at a court in The Hague on Wednesday, judge Mariette Renckens said that ""all requirements of the euthanasia legislation"" had been met. ""Therefore the suspect is acquitted of all charges,"" the judge said. Wanting to die before dementia - at 'five to midnight' What is assisted suicide and euthanasia? Man at centre of end-of-life debate in France dies Prosecutors argued that the doctor, who has not been named and has since retired, ""acted with the best intentions"" but broke Dutch euthanasia law by failing to ensure the consent of the woman, who may have changed her mind. They argued that a more intensive discussion could have taken place before the decision to end her life. The doctor allegedly sedated the woman, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, then she asked her family to hold her down as she administered a lethal drug. She maintained that she had acted cautiously. The trial was considered an important test case, as people are living longer and are therefore more likely to develop conditions that affect their ability to think and remember. By Anna Holligan, BBC Hague correspondent Should someone who makes a choice when they are of sound mind be held to that choice when they are not? Yes, was the judge's answer to the key question at the heart of this emotive test case. There was a small round of applause as the verdict was read out in front of a crowded courtroom. Euthanasia is supposed to empower the patient, offering them the chance to decide when they want to die. Even in a country where it's been legal for almost two decades, the practice remains controversial. In this case, the judges ruled that by the time the patient died it would have been impossible to establish what she wanted, such was the severity of her dementia that she no longer understood what the word ""euthanasia"" even meant. This trial forced doctors and lawyers to confront a practical and moral dilemma; at what point do you stop checking if someone wants to live or die, and should they still have the power to decide if they're not fully in control of their mental capacities? After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years before she died, the patient wrote a statement saying that she wanted to be euthanised before entering a care home - but that she wanted to decide when the time was right. Before she was taken into care, a doctor decided that assisted suicide should be administered based on her prior statement. This was confirmed by two separate doctors independently and a date was set. When the day came to end the woman's life, a sedative was put in her coffee and she lost consciousness. But the woman then woke up and had to be held down by her daughter and husband while the process was finished. At the centre of the case was the question of the woman's ability to consent to ending her life despite her previous statement. ""A crucial question to this case is how long a doctor should continue consulting a patient with dementia, if the patient in an earlier stage already requested euthanasia,"" prosecution service spokeswoman Sanna van der Harg said. ""We do not doubt the doctor's honest intentions,"" she said. ""A more intensive discussion with the patient"" could have taken place before the decision to end her life, she added. However, the daughter of the deceased woman thanked the doctor. ""The doctor freed my mother from the mental prison which she ended up in,"" she said in a statement.

Trump plans bans on sale of flavoured e-cigarettes,"This video can not be played 'I felt helpless to stop my son's addiction': Kristen wants vaping companies held accountable US President Donald Trump has announced that his administration will ban flavoured e-cigarettes, after a spate of vaping-related deaths. Mr Trump told reporters vaping was a ""new problem"", especially for children. US Health Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would finalise a plan to take all non-tobacco flavours off the market. There have been six deaths and 450 reported cases of lung illness tied to vaping across 33 states. Many of the 450 reported cases are young people, with an average age of 19. Michigan this month became the first US state to ban flavoured e-cigarettes. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? Joining Mr Trump at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Azar said it would take the FDA several weeks to distribute the new guidance on e-cigarettes. This video can not be played President Donald Trump: 'People are dying with vaping' He also said the agency would take enforcement action if it determined children were being intentionally attracted to e-cigarettes. US First Lady Melania Trump this week tweeted that she was ""deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump told reporters his administration would implement strong rules to protect ""innocent children"", including his 13-year-old son Barron. ""We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected,"" he said. ""That's how the first lady got involved. She's got a son, together, that is a beautiful young man and she feels very, very strongly about it. ""She's seen it. We're both reading it, a lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely."" He added that he hoped the announcement would make parents become ""tougher"". ""People are going to watch what we're saying and parents are going be a lot tougher with respect to their children,"" said the president. ""A lot of people think vaping is wonderful, it's great. It's really not wonderful."" Juul 'ignored law' in US e-cigarette adverts In a press release shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, the health secretary said officials ""will not stand idly by"" as a generation becomes addicted to nicotine. Acting FDA Commissioner Dr Ned Sharpless said ""if we see a migration to tobacco-flavored products by kids, we will take additional steps to address youth use of these products"". E-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul have been blamed for fuelling childhood addiction through flavoured products such as mango, cream or cinnamon roll. Juul, which dominates the market, last year stopped selling most of its flavoured devices in order to defuse mounting criticism. Health officials are still investigating whether a particular toxin or substance is causing the vaping-related illnesses, or whether it's the result of heavy usage. The first death occurred in Illinois in late August. Since then, five more have died and hundreds have been sickened across 33 states. The cause of the vaping illness has not yet been pinpointed by health officials. THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, was present in some, but not all of the devices used by those who fell ill, say authorities. The FDA has said many of the products were found to contain significant amounts of vitamin E acetate, an oil used to thicken the vaping liquid. Several patients have been found with lipoid pneumonia, which occurs when someone inhales fats or oils. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US?

"Breaking|Breaking newsChildren's hospital delayed until autumn next yearRepairs costing Â£16m are needed at the brand new Sick Kids in Edinburgh before it can be opened to patients.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","An artist's impression of how the new hospital would look The new children's hospital in Edinburgh won't be fully operational for at least another year, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has revealed. The Sick Kids facility was due to open in July, butlast-minute inspections found safety concernsover its ventilation systems. Now a new report has found at least Â£16m worth of work is needed. NHS Lothian is payingabout Â£1.4m in monthly repaymentsto the private consortium which built the facility. An independent review of the governance arrangements for the new hospital found that the main issue with ventilation in critical care stemmed from an error in a document produced by NHS Lothian at the tender stage in 2012. It found that this was human error relating to confusion over interpretation of building standards and guidance, and that opportunities to spot and rectify the error were missed. Ms Freeman said it was ""unacceptable"" that the hospital could not be delivered on time and revealed a troubleshooter would be brought in to help manage the project. She added: ""The safest possible care of their children is my overriding priority and I am sorry for any impact the current situation has had on them. ""I am of course bitterly disappointed that a mistake made in 2012 was not picked up earlier. ""This is a publicly funded project of strategic importance, which has not been delivered by NHS Lothian in compliance with the standards and guidance. ""The delay we now face will be borne by NHS Lothian staff, by patients and their families and the additional cost will be to the public purse."" The new hospital has faced a number of delays and disagreements between the contractors and NHS Lothian The Scottish government revealed that at least Â£16m was needed to rectify the problems, such as ventilation, at the new building. The ventilation issue affects the critical care unit, as previously revealed, but also the oncology and haematology departments. Some remedial and precautionary action is recommended for water systems, though no widespread contamination was found. In addition, ""active monitoring"" of the building's drainage and plumbing has been recommended but the prospect of problems in this area was graded as ""low risk"". Asked about the cost of keeping the existing Sick Kids hospital open until the new facility is ready, Ms Freeman said this would be between Â£6m and Â£7m. The existing site has been sold to a student housing developer which had expected to have taken possession of the site by now. Two reviews into the Sick Kids delay were ordered by Ms Freeman, one by accountancy giant KPMG and another by the National Services Scotland (NSS) division of the NHS. The findings include: One of the original tender documents issued by NHS Lothian to bidders stated single bed cubicles and four-bed rooms in the critical care ward required a ventilation system with four air changes per hour. However, the relevant guidance states 12 changes per hour are needed for this type of hospital ward. At the time of the project's financial close in 2015, the KPMG report states ""designs for the hospital had not been fully developed"". This included issues relating to the design of the ventilation systems. Independent contractors testing the ventilation in the hospital's critical care wards first flagged the air change problem to NHS Lothian on 24 June. The next day consortium IHSL said the issues could be resolved. However, by 1 July it had been established that the ventilation system was not capable of ten air changes per hour.  The delay to opening was announced on 4 July. The new hospital has a helipad on its roof but NSS found no testing has been carried out to assess what impact the downdraft from helicopters would have given that air intakes and windows are sited in the courtyard below. NHS Lothian said it has shared modelling of the impact with NSS and will now undertake test flights on the helipad. Ms Freeman said that ""due to the scale of the challenge"" a senior programme director will take over responsibility from NHS Lothian to deliver the project. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""The taxpayer will have to fork out more than Â£30m between now and next autumn to compensate for these catastrophic failings. ""Staff and families alike will also be sceptical about whether this hospital will be open by next autumn. ""They've been promised - year after year - that new timescales will be adhered to, and they've been repeatedly let down."" Staff were ready to leave the old Sick Kids hospital in July The new Sick Children's Hospital cost about Â£150m to build, but its full price tag over the next 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, will be Â£432m. Under the terms of the contract, repayments - which would average about Â£1.4m a month - began in February when NHS Lothian took possession of the site from private consortium IHSL. Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said: ""Someone signed off this new hospital when it was clearly not safe or in a fit state for use by our children. That raises the question for who is responsible and liable for this mess.""

"Labour must unequivocally back Remain, says deputy","This video can not be played Watson: Labour should 'unequivocally back Remain' Labour should ""unequivocally back Remain"" in a fresh Brexit referendum and only then pursue power in a general election, its deputy has said. Tom Watson said there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit deal"" and the 2016 Leave vote had been ""invalidated"". Jeremy Corbyn said he did ""not accept or agree with"" his deputy's view. ""Our priority is to get a general election in order to give the people a chance to elect a government that cares for them,"" he said. The Labour leader wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a ""credible"" Leave proposal. However, he has said he would only choose a side once the shape of any revised Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government became clear. The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Mr Watson was directly elected as deputy leader by party members, not appointed by Mr Corbyn, and so has a right to roam on policy other shadow cabinet ministers might not get away with it. Watson: What's Corbyn's thinking on Brexit? Labour manifesto to offer vote on Leave and Remain In a speech in London, Mr Watson said while an autumn general election seemed inevitable ""that does not make it desirable"". ""Elections should never be single issue campaigns,"" he argued, suggesting vital issues such as the future of the NHS, economic inequality and crime would be ""drowned out"" by the prime minister's ""do or die"" Brexit message. ""The only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,"" he said. ""A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos."" In the event of another general election in the coming months, Mr Watson said Labour must be ""crystal clear"" about where it stands on Brexit if it wants to get a hearing for the rest of its domestic policy agenda. ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for Remain. That is what the overwhelming majority of Labour Party members, MPs and trade unions believe."" Mr Watson will said that, though ""very difficult"", he and many others ""respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time"". But, he added: ""There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again."" The Liberal Democrats, who pushed Labour into third place in May's European elections with a strident anti-Brexit message, are pushing for Brexit to be stopped in its tracks by revoking Article 50 - the legal process for the UK's departure. While stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson said it was not too late for Labour to ""win back"" Remain voters. Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Where do the parties stand? Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' ""My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,"" he added. ""They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it."" Former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith said Mr Watson was speaking for ""the majority of Labour members and Labour voters"", and that the party ""should be clearing the Brexit issue off the table before we get to an election"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn committed to a referendum with a ""credible Leave option"" on Tuesday But another Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of Theresa May's original withdrawal agreement - said the ""numbers simply don't exist"" in Parliament to approve a further referendum. He told Today: ""The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every weekâ¦ [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible."" Just 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn hammered out a deal with the Labour-supporting unions, his deputy, Tom Watson, shattered any fragile unity. Mr Watson and many Labour activists want a clearer commitment to campaign on a Remain platform - especially during a snap election. So, apart from his own scepticism towards an EU that he believes needs reform, what is the thinking behind Jeremy Corbyn's position? Well, it comes down to four things - psephology, party unity, politics and personal authority. Read more from Iain. Unite's Len McCluskey dismissed Mr Watson's intervention, accusing him of ""undermining"" the leadership and suggesting his views ""don't really matter"". The two men, who used to be close friends, fell out spectacularly in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum during an uprising by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership. The union leader suggested Mr Watson was ""languishing on the fringes"" of the party, adding: ""It's sad. Now and again Tom pops up from where he has been hiding and comes up with somethingâ¦ which is normally to try and undermine his leader."" The Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Labour has voted twice against Boris Johnson's plans for a poll on 15 October. The party's leadership has insisted it is eager for an election after the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been ruled out.

"Retailers shut 2,870 stores in first half of 2019","About 16 shops are closing every day as retailers restructure their businesses and more shopping moves online. A net 1,234 stores shut on Britain's top 500 high streets in the first half of the year, according to research by PwC and the Local Data Company. That is up from 1,123 in the same period last year and the highest since the survey began in 2010. Fashion retailers saw the biggest declines in the period, followed by restaurants, estate agents and pubs. However, there were more openings of takeaways and sport and health clubs. Five ways the High Street is changing Green secures rescue for Topshop empire Debenhams creditors back turnaround plan Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: ""The decline in store numbers in the first half of 2019 shows that there's been no let-up in the changing ways that people shop and the cost pressures affecting High Street operators."" She said retailers had to invest more in making stores ""relevant to today's consumers"", but added that ""new and different types of operators"" needed encouragement to fill vacant space. According to PwC, 1,634 stores opened in the six months to the end of June - a 4% increase on the same period last year - while 2,868 stores shut. The data looks at retail chains with more than five outlets. This video can not be played Can Â£5 burgers help boost one town's city centre? High Street retailers continue to face growing competition from online operators such as Amazon, making it harder to pay their rents and other overheads, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates. It has led to big names such asToys R Us going into administration, while others such as Topshop-owner Arcadia,Debenhamsand New Look have announced large-scale closures. According to PwC, fashion retail continued to be the hardest hit sector in the six months to June, with 10 stores a week closing, mainly as a result of high profile administrations and restructurings Meanwhile, there were net declines of 103 restaurants, 100 estate agents and 96 pubs. Greater London saw the largest number of net closures of any region, although when taking into account its higher number of shops, its closure rate was in line with the national average. The East Midlands, North East, South East and Yorkshire and the Humber were the only regions to see fewer closures than last year.

Homophobic abuse charges fall despite reports soarSome victims say they have reported hate crimes to the police but not seen anyone charged as a result.UK,"In London, which holds an annual Pride parade, the number of people charged or summonsed for homophobic hate crimes has fallen by around a third Fewer people are being prosecuted for homophobic hate crimes despite rising numbers of potential victims coming forward, figures suggest. Recorded reports of homophobic abuse in the UK increased from 5,807 in 2014-15, to 13,530 in 2018-19. But during the same period, the number of prosecutions fell from 1,157 to 1,058 - from 20% of all reports to 8%. The National Police Chiefs' Council said those cases often involved a lack of witnesses and evidence. It comes as police forces continue to call on victims to come forward. The figures have been revealed after BBC Radio 5 Live Investigations sent a Freedom of Information request to 46 police forces across the UK and received full responses from 38 forces. Data from Police Scotland was only partial and was not included in the analysis. A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"". This video can not be played Lily Cherry has shared experiences with the BBC's LGBT Correspondent Ben Hunte ""A guy walked up to me and my friends and said 'What is this, the fat ugly homosexual squad?'"", said 17-year-old Lily Cherry, from Woodseats in Sheffield. ""We reported it to the police and they said they'd check CCTV, but nothing came of it. ""I think that the police and authorities should do more to protect people who are in the minority and they should take it more seriously and in depth. ""I think it's getting to the point where this abuse is so regular and so often reported that it can just be dismissed too easily."" South Yorkshire Police said it investigated this case but ""due to the lack of CCTV and other investigative opportunities, no suspect(s) have been identified and therefore a charge in this matter is not likely."" ""We take all reports of hate crime incredibly seriously and would welcome a further conversation with the victim in this matter to inform our learning,"" it added. Two of the most dramatic rises in reports of homophobic hate crime were experienced by Yorkshire's biggest forces - West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire Police. West Yorkshire Police has seen reports increase from 172 to 961 over the past five years, while South Yorkshire police has seen reports rise from 73 to 375. Angela Williams, of West Yorkshire Police, said rising reports were in part down to ""improvements in the way we record crime and the fact that many victims have the confidence to come forward"". The proportion of crimes that resulted in a charge or summons, however, fell over the same time, from 19% to 4% in West Yorkshire and from 10% to 3% in South Yorkshire. Analysis by Ben Hunte, LGBT Correspondent These new figures will disappoint the LGBT community but they will not be a great surprise to many. With Pride parades regularly taking place in many UK cities, on the surface it seems like society is much more accepting of LGBT people living their lives. In reality, however, every single day LGBT people across the UK are contacting the police about verbal and physical abuse they experience just because of their sexuality. A number of abuse victims have told me the process of trying to convict their abusers has put them off. They have gone as far as dropping their cases in fear of having to recount traumatic experiences, or being inadvertently outed to their friends, family or employers. Trips to police stations, as well as calls and visits from police officers to discuss their LGBT abuse experiences can be daunting if that person is not actually open about their LGBT status. They say that all too often it is difficult to prove that an assault was motivated by hostility towards the victim's sexuality or gender identity, so attackers currently get off with lighter sentences. Two of Britain's largest police forces - London's Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police - have also seen an increase in the number of reported crimes. The Met saw reports rise from 1,561 in 2014-2015 to 2,315 in 2018-19, while the number of cases that led to charges or summons fell from 246 to 165. Greater Manchester Police saw reports rise from 423 to 1,159, with the number of charges falling from 82 to 50. A Met Police spokesman said: ""Many of these non-violent offences present less evidential opportunities and victims often feel that there is a barrier between bringing the matter to court and prefer to make police aware of each offence."" Police said there was little evidence for many homophobic hate crimes and victims may choose not to bring a case to court A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said: ""Unfortunately, with many cases, there are often no witnesses to these crimes and scarce evidence - this may lead to police being unable to identify a suspect."" The Home Office said it was recruiting 20,000 additional police officers and investing a further Â£85m in the Crown Prosecution Service over the next two years to ""ensure it can deal with the cases brought by the police"". Baroness Williams, minister for countering extremism, said: ""Victims should not have to put up with this venomous abuse and we will do all we can to support them. ""I would urge anyone who is affected by or has witnessed homophobic abuse to contact the police. Partners across the criminal justice system and government are working hard to empower victims to report incidents and ensure perpetrators are punished.""

Strike-hit BA says services getting back to normal,"British Airways says about 90% of services will run as normal on Wednesday as the airline recovers from a two-day strike by pilots. However, BA said its full schedule would not be in place for ""some time"" as 150 aircraft and 700 pilots started the day ""in the wrong place"". BA cancelled almost all its flights on Monday and Tuesday in a dispute over pay and conditions. Another strike by pilots is planned for later this month. BA said on Wednesday: ""The nature of our highly complex, global operation means that it will take some time to get back to a completely normal flight schedule however, we plan to fly more than 90% of our flights today."" About half of the airline's 300 aircraft are out of position. And in addition to pilots being in the wrong place, BA said there was severe disruption to rosters for its 4,000 cabin crew. The airline is offering affected customers refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or an alternative airline. Balpa said that the strikes had been a ""powerful demonstration of the strength of feeling of BA pilots"". Tens of thousands of flights had to be cancelled, costing BA an estimated Â£40m a day. Can strike-hit BA rebuild its reputation? BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? It called on the airline to come ""back to the negotiating table with some meaningful proposals"" to try to avert the next scheduled strike, on 27 September. Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Surely any reasonable employer would listen to such a clear message, stop threatening and bullying, and start working towards finding a solution."" Pilots had previously rejected an 11.5% pay increase over three years proposed by BA in July.

British-Australian women 'held in Iran',"A guard at Evin prison in Tehran, Iran Two British-Australian women and an Australian man have been detained in Iran amid growing tensions between London and Tehran. One of the women was arrested with her boyfriend 10 weeks ago on unknown charges and another woman was jailed for 10 years, according tothe Times,external. Iran has held several dual nationals in recent years, including the British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Her husband said: ""This hostage diplomacy cannot go on."" Relations between the UK and Iran have been strained in recent months by a row over theseizure of oil tankers in the Gulf. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab met the Iranian ambassador, aftersummoning himto discuss Iran's behaviour over a seized tanker's oil. Mr Raab said it was clear the tanker had transferred its cargo to Syria after its release, in breach of EU sanctions. During the meeting, Mr Raab ""raised serious concerns about the number of dual national citizens detained by Iran and their conditions of detention"", the Foreign Office said. The two British-Australian women are believed to be the first British passport holders without dual Iranian nationality to be held in the country in recent years. Australia's government said it was assisting the detainees' families. The cases are not thought to be linked. The BBC understands the two British-Australian women are in Tehran's Evin jail, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, a mother of one from London, has been held on spying charges since 2016. She denies the allegations. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) What is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case about? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals One of the women being detained is reportedly a blogger who was travelling through Asia with her Australian boyfriend. A source told the BBC that she has been told she is being held as part of a plan for a potential prisoner swap with Australia. The second woman is said to be an academic who studied at the University of Cambridge and was lecturing at an Australian university. While the charges against the second woman remain unclear, 10-year terms are routinely given in Iran for spying charges, the Times said. One of the women is thought to be in the same ward for female political prisoners as Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said: ""Our hearts reach out to the families involved. It is tough being at the wrong end of Iran's hostage-taking. ""I hope Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab use their upcoming meetings at the UN to make clear to Iran that enough is enough. ""This hostage diplomacy cannot go on."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since April 2016 The Foreign Office (FCO) said the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) was leading on the cases. The DFAT told the BBC it would not comment further after confirming it was providing consular assistance. Tulip Siddiq, who is Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, responded to the news,tweeting:,external""Iran once again ups the stakes. ""This is a wake up call for our prime minister, government and ministers that they must act urgently to bring our innocent citizens home."" Former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Iran does work on a basis of putting the pressure on these countries that it believes are hostile to it. ""And hostage-taking appears to be part of the practice."" He said the policy of detaining people ""means that it makes it very difficult for those who want a different relationship with Iran to get on the front foot with those who regard it as unremittingly hostile."" The Australian government said its travel advice for some parts of Iran was that it was not safe to travel. It warns ""there is a risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained, or arrested"". The FCO website also warns of the risks from travelling in Iran. ""The security forces may be suspicious of people with British connections,"" it states. Iran's judiciary said last month it had sentenced a British-Iranian dual nationalto 10 years for allegedly spying for Israel. Anousheh Ashouri was detained over allegations he was working for the Mossad intelligence agency. He was also given an additional two-year jail term for illicitly acquiring money and fined $36,600 (Â£29,850). Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened in recent months. In July, the UK became involved when British Royal Marines helped detain an Iranian tanker in waters off the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. The Adrian Darya One - previously called Grace One - was released after Iran gave written assurances that it was not bound for Syria. But Mr Raab said it was clear the ship had transferred its cargo in Syria after being released. In a statement, the foreign office said Iran's actions represented an ""unacceptable violation of international norms"" and that the UK would raise the issue at the UN General Assembly later this month. But an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman would only say the ship had delivered its cargo after docking ""on the Mediterranean coast"".

Homophobic abuse charges fall despite reports rise,"In London, which holds an annual Pride parade, the number of people charged or summonsed for homophobic hate crimes has fallen by around a third Fewer people are being prosecuted for homophobic hate crimes despite rising numbers of potential victims coming forward, figures suggest. Recorded reports of homophobic abuse in the UK increased from 5,807 in 2014-15, to 13,530 in 2018-19. But during the same period, the number of prosecutions fell from 1,157 to 1,058 - from 20% of all reports to 8%. The National Police Chiefs' Council said those cases often involved a lack of witnesses and evidence. It comes as police forces continue to call on victims to come forward. The figures have been revealed after BBC Radio 5 Live Investigations sent a Freedom of Information request to 46 police forces across the UK and received full responses from 38 forces. Data from Police Scotland was only partial and was not included in the analysis. A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"". This video can not be played Lily Cherry has shared experiences with the BBC's LGBT Correspondent Ben Hunte ""A guy walked up to me and my friends and said 'What is this, the fat ugly homosexual squad?'"", said 17-year-old Lily Cherry, from Woodseats in Sheffield. ""We reported it to the police and they said they'd check CCTV, but nothing came of it. ""I think that the police and authorities should do more to protect people who are in the minority and they should take it more seriously and in depth. ""I think it's getting to the point where this abuse is so regular and so often reported that it can just be dismissed too easily."" South Yorkshire Police said it investigated this case but ""due to the lack of CCTV and other investigative opportunities, no suspect(s) have been identified and therefore a charge in this matter is not likely."" ""We take all reports of hate crime incredibly seriously and would welcome a further conversation with the victim in this matter to inform our learning,"" it added. Two of the most dramatic rises in reports of homophobic hate crime were experienced by Yorkshire's biggest forces - West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire Police. West Yorkshire Police has seen reports increase from 172 to 961 over the past five years, while South Yorkshire police has seen reports rise from 73 to 375. Angela Williams, of West Yorkshire Police, said rising reports were in part down to ""improvements in the way we record crime and the fact that many victims have the confidence to come forward"". The proportion of crimes that resulted in a charge or summons, however, fell over the same time, from 19% to 4% in West Yorkshire and from 10% to 3% in South Yorkshire. Analysis by Ben Hunte, LGBT Correspondent These new figures will disappoint the LGBT community but they will not be a great surprise to many. With Pride parades regularly taking place in many UK cities, on the surface it seems like society is much more accepting of LGBT people living their lives. In reality, however, every single day LGBT people across the UK are contacting the police about verbal and physical abuse they experience just because of their sexuality. A number of abuse victims have told me the process of trying to convict their abusers has put them off. They have gone as far as dropping their cases in fear of having to recount traumatic experiences, or being inadvertently outed to their friends, family or employers. Trips to police stations, as well as calls and visits from police officers to discuss their LGBT abuse experiences can be daunting if that person is not actually open about their LGBT status. They say that all too often it is difficult to prove that an assault was motivated by hostility towards the victim's sexuality or gender identity, so attackers currently get off with lighter sentences. Two of Britain's largest police forces - London's Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police - have also seen an increase in the number of reported crimes. The Met saw reports rise from 1,561 in 2014-2015 to 2,315 in 2018-19, while the number of cases that led to charges or summons fell from 246 to 165. Greater Manchester Police saw reports rise from 423 to 1,159, with the number of charges falling from 82 to 50. A Met Police spokesman said: ""Many of these non-violent offences present less evidential opportunities and victims often feel that there is a barrier between bringing the matter to court and prefer to make police aware of each offence."" Police said there was little evidence for many homophobic hate crimes and victims may choose not to bring a case to court A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said: ""Unfortunately, with many cases, there are often no witnesses to these crimes and scarce evidence - this may lead to police being unable to identify a suspect."" The Home Office said it was recruiting 20,000 additional police officers and investing a further Â£85m in the Crown Prosecution Service over the next two years to ""ensure it can deal with the cases brought by the police"". Baroness Williams, minister for countering extremism, said: ""Victims should not have to put up with this venomous abuse and we will do all we can to support them. ""I would urge anyone who is affected by or has witnessed homophobic abuse to contact the police. Partners across the criminal justice system and government are working hard to empower victims to report incidents and ensure perpetrators are punished.""

University 'still a good investment',"Going to university in England is still a good investment for young people, says an annual international report, which rejected claims there were too many graduates. The study from the OECD economics think tank says despite facing among the highest tuition fees in the world, the increased earning power of graduates would still ""greatly exceed the cost"". ""Educated people throughout history have always argued there are too many other educated people,"" said the OECD's education director Andreas Schleicher. But he argued that universities needed to face much more scrutiny over the quality of courses and qualifications. Mr Schleicher said that at school level, the UK education systems were leading the world in measuring how pupils progressed - but at university level, there was much less information about how students were learning. He rejected arguments that too many people were going to university - but said if universities expanded further there needed to be more clarity about standards and what they were offering students in terms of future employment. Teachers' starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 University applications hit record numbers Review calls for tuition fees to be cut to Â£7,250 The report showed a narrowing gap in the higher earnings of graduates across the UK. In 2013, graduates had average earnings that were 54% higher than non-graduates, which had reduced to a 42% advantage in 2017. Below these averages, there were significant differences - such as higher earnings for those who studied maths and sciences and lower earnings for graduates of arts and humanities. Despite this likely outcome in earnings, the OECD report said universities in the UK had increased places for arts and humanities at a greater rate than in-demand subjects such as engineering. Mr Schleicher said the debate about too many people staying in education had always been there - and there was no real evidence of any reduction in demand for graduates and highly skilled people. ""If we had this discussion a hundred years ago, there would have been people saying there were too many people going to high school,"" he said, at the launch of the report in London. There were no signs of modern economies needing fewer well-qualified people, he said. The report showed the strong international growth in higher education - with 44% of people aged 25 to 34 across the OECD now having degrees, compared with 35% a decade ago. But that ""doesn't mean everyone has to go to university"", said the OECD education director. High quality vocational education was also needed - and Mr Schleicher said there was a ""disturbing picture"" in which those who already had the worst skills were the least likely to be able to get extra training. The annual report also highlighted the ways in which teachers' pay in England was unlike other countries. It showed that relative to graduate earnings, head teachers in England were better paid than in any other country in the developed world. But classroom teachers, by the same measure, had below-average pay. The levels of starting salaries for teachers in England were also below average by these international comparisons. In the recent round of spending announcements, the Department for Education said that it would increase starting pay for teachers in England to Â£30,000. Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Record numbers in England apply for degree LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

Australia beats UK for students,"Students arriving in Melbourne - ranked this year as one of the world's best student cities Australia is overtaking the UK as the world's second biggest destination for international students, says research from University College London. Researchers at UCL's Centre for Global Higher Education say the UK is being pushed into third place behind the United States and Australia. Australia has been rapidly expanding its international student numbers. The British Council says it shows the UK needs to ""look again"" at its policies towards overseas students. An analysis this year found that overseas students added Â£20bn to the UK's economy - and universities in the UK have warned that immigration rules after Brexit will need to be more welcoming for students. The UCL study has tracked the latest movements in international students and report author Professor Simon Marginson says Australia is moving ahead of the UK. He warns that Canada is also catching up in taking a growing slice of the lucrative overseas student market. Overseas students starting in Melbourne this year were invited to a welcome party and dance Three years ago the UK was recruiting around 130,000 more overseas students than Australia, says Prof Marginson, who is also co-chair of the Higher Education Commission's current inquiry into international students. But he says successive years of Australia having increases of 12% to 14% in overseas students have seen it catch up and overtake the UK, which has been growing much more slowly. Official student figures for 2018 from the UN's education agency, Unesco, will not be published until after the end of this year. But the UCL researchers are ""certain"" that Australia is on the verge of moving ahead of the UK in overseas students and this ""may have already happened"". ""UK higher education is still highly valued internationally, but the government has held down the growth of international student numbers for five years, by limiting new student numbers and post-study work visas,"" says Prof Marginson. ""Meanwhile, competitor nations are strongly promoting their international education."" Overseas students add Â£20bn to the economy Door kept open to EU students after Brexit London ranked best city for students Trump's biggest fans? Canadian universities Australia has been marketing itself as an English-speaking country with high-performing universities, with an attractive climate and a welcoming culture for overseas students. This year's Best Student Cities rankings put Melbourne and Sydney in the top 10 - although London was the highest ranked of all. Australia has succeeded in attracting students from outside Europe, particularly from China. The research from UCL warns that the UK's future intake of international students will depend on keeping its appeal for European students. Last week, the government set out post-Brexit plans that would keep open the door to visa-free travel for European Union students coming to UK universities. But there was no detail on whether EU students would have to pay full international fees. Universities in the UK have been campaigning for overseas students to be taken out of net migration figures. A spokeswoman for the British Council said that international students are ""an immense source of long-term influence and soft power for the UK"". She said the UK was competing with countries with ""welcoming visa policies"" and ""comprehensive international education strategies"". With the approach of Brexit, she said ""it has never been more important to reinforce and open up international channels for the UK"".

Newspaper details Khashoggi 'death recordings',"The newspaper says Jamal Khashoggi (pictured on sign) told his killers not to cover his mouth A Turkish newspaper has published new details of a recording which reportedly captured the final moments of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The prominent government critic was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul last October. The pro-government Sabah newspaper says the transcript is from a recording taken inside,externaland later obtained by Turkish intelligence. It includes information such as the journalist's alleged last words. Khashoggi wrote a column for the Washington Post newspaper and was based in the US before his disappearance. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 to obtain papers he needed to marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The journalist who vanished into a consulate Khashoggi, MH17 and the problem of impunity His mysterious death piled scrutiny on Saudi Arabia, which released conflicting information regarding his disappearance in the aftermath. Saudi authorities have since blamed a ""rogue"" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. The Sabah has consistently made international headlines by carrying details - including some that have been disputed - about the journalist's mysterious death. The newspaper published two new reports this week into Khashoggi's death at the hands of a group they label a ""hit squad"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Their latest report details information from the alleged recording. It includes details such as a forensic expert, part of a team sent from Saudi Arabia, allegedly referring to the journalist as an ""animal to be sacrificed"" prior to his arrival. The Sabah report says Khashoggi, once inside the consulate, became suspicious and was told he had to return to Riyadh because of an Interpol order. The journalist allegedly refused to comply with the group's requests, which included texting his son, and was then drugged, according to the newspaper. He reportedly then told his killers, in his last words, to not keep his mouth closed because of his asthma, but then lost consciousness. Khashoggi was suffocated with a bag put over his head, the Sabah reports, with the sounds of a scuffle allegedly picked up by the recording. The newspaper also alleges the tape captured his alleged dismemberment at the hands of the forensic expert. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Reports of the existence of audio recordings from Khashoggi's death have been around since last year. Turkish officials have publicly confirmed their existenceand say they have shared them with international governments but is unclear how the newspaper apparently obtained them. Almost a year on from his death, Khashoggi's body has not been recovered, despite international pressure. Earlier this year, a UN expert on extrajudicial killings called for an independent and impartial investigation into his death. Special rapporteur Agnes Callamard described the journalist's death as a ""deliberate, premeditated execution"" and alleges ""the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible"" and should be investigated. The Saudi government rejected her report and has consistently denied those responsible for the death were acting on official orders.

BA warns of continuing disruption after strikes,"British Airways says about 90% of services will run as normal on Wednesday as the airline recovers from a two-day strike by pilots. However, BA said its full schedule would not be in place for ""some time"" as 150 aircraft and 700 pilots started the day ""in the wrong place"". BA cancelled almost all its flights on Monday and Tuesday in a dispute over pay and conditions. Another strike by pilots is planned for later this month. BA said on Wednesday: ""The nature of our highly complex, global operation means that it will take some time to get back to a completely normal flight schedule however, we plan to fly more than 90% of our flights today."" About half of the airline's 300 aircraft are out of position. And in addition to pilots being in the wrong place, BA said there was severe disruption to rosters for its 4,000 cabin crew. The airline is offering affected customers refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or an alternative airline. Balpa said that the strikes had been a ""powerful demonstration of the strength of feeling of BA pilots"". Tens of thousands of flights had to be cancelled, costing BA an estimated Â£40m a day. Can strike-hit BA rebuild its reputation? BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? It called on the airline to come ""back to the negotiating table with some meaningful proposals"" to try to avert the next scheduled strike, on 27 September. Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Surely any reasonable employer would listen to such a clear message, stop threatening and bullying, and start working towards finding a solution."" Pilots had previously rejected an 11.5% pay increase over three years proposed by BA in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. But it says that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA has said its pilots are already paid ""world-class"" salaries, and has described the pay offer as ""fair and generous"". After three years of the proposed pay deal, some captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 per year, including allowances, it said. Can strike-hit BA rebuild its reputation?

University 'still good value for future earnings',"Going to university in England is still a good investment for young people, says an annual international report, which rejected claims there were too many graduates. The study from the OECD economics think tank says despite facing among the highest tuition fees in the world, the increased earning power of graduates would still ""greatly exceed the cost"". ""Educated people throughout history have always argued there are too many other educated people,"" said the OECD's education director Andreas Schleicher. But he argued that universities needed to face much more scrutiny over the quality of courses and qualifications. Mr Schleicher said that at school level, the UK education systems were leading the world in measuring how pupils progressed - but at university level, there was much less information about how students were learning. He rejected arguments that too many people were going to university - but said if universities expanded further there needed to be more clarity about standards and what they were offering students in terms of future employment. Teachers' starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 University applications hit record numbers Review calls for tuition fees to be cut to Â£7,250 The report showed a narrowing gap in the higher earnings of graduates across the UK. In 2013, graduates had average earnings that were 54% higher than non-graduates, which had reduced to a 42% advantage in 2017. Below these averages, there were significant differences - such as higher earnings for those who studied maths and sciences and lower earnings for graduates of arts and humanities. Despite this likely outcome in earnings, the OECD report said universities in the UK had increased places for arts and humanities at a greater rate than in-demand subjects such as engineering. Mr Schleicher said the debate about too many people staying in education had always been there - and there was no real evidence of any reduction in demand for graduates and highly skilled people. ""If we had this discussion a hundred years ago, there would have been people saying there were too many people going to high school,"" he said, at the launch of the report in London. There were no signs of modern economies needing fewer well-qualified people, he said. The report showed the strong international growth in higher education - with 44% of people aged 25 to 34 across the OECD now having degrees, compared with 35% a decade ago. But that ""doesn't mean everyone has to go to university"", said the OECD education director. High quality vocational education was also needed - and Mr Schleicher said there was a ""disturbing picture"" in which those who already had the worst skills were the least likely to be able to get extra training. The annual report also highlighted the ways in which teachers' pay in England was unlike other countries. It showed that relative to graduate earnings, head teachers in England were better paid than in any other country in the developed world. But classroom teachers, by the same measure, had below-average pay. The levels of starting salaries for teachers in England were also below average by these international comparisons. In the recent round of spending announcements, the Department for Education said that it would increase starting pay for teachers in England to Â£30,000. Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Record numbers in England apply for degree LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

"There is a way to get a Brexit deal, PM insists","This video can not be played PM: Government doing what the people want Boris Johnson has said ""there is a way"" of getting a new Brexit deal, as he defended the decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. The PM said ""loads of people"" wanted an agreement, but he was prepared to leave without one if ""absolutely necessary"". Parliament will not resume sitting until 14 October, three days before a crucial Brexit summit of EU leaders. The PM, who has met the leadership of Northern Ireland's DUP, said claims this was undemocratic were ""nonsense"". Amid unprecedented scenes in the Commons early on Tuesday, some MPs protested against the suspension with signs saying ""silenced"" while shouting: ""Shame on you."" Where do the parties now stand on Brexit? PM rejects NI-only backstop solution, says DUP Could no deal still happen on 31 October? But Mr Johnson rejected claims this was an affront to democracy, saying the opposition parties were given the chance of an election before the Brexit deadline on 31 October but had spurned it. This video can not be played Some MPs voiced their objection to the suspension in the Commons Opposition MPs said a law blocking a no-deal Brexit must be implemented before there could be any election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised a further referendum on Brexitwith a ""credible Leave option"" versus Remain if he wins the next general election - but the party is unlikely to commit to either option in its manifesto. The prime minister held an hour of talks with Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds in Downing Street. Mrs Foster, whose party has propped up the Conservative government since the 2017 election, issued a statement later indicating it would not support any revised version of Theresa May's Brexit agreement which separated Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. She said renewed talk of a so-called Northern Ireland-only backstop, which would see it remain in the customs union and be bound by EU rules for goods and animal products while the rest of the UK was not, would be ""unacceptable"". Brexitcast: Flying Flamingos & Executive Fiats What election options does the PM have left? Why are MPs being sent home? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""A sensible deal, between the United Kingdom and European Union which respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, is the best way forward for everyone,"" she said. ""History teaches us that any deal relating to Northern Ireland which cannot command cross community support is doomed to failure. That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed. ""During today's meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland."" This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Monday? The Irish border has proved a key sticking point in attempts to agree a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The government has indicated it could support harmonised rules for the agriculture and food sector to prevent the need for any sanitary and other health checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But it has distanced itself from reports that plans for a single EU-UK customs territory in the current withdrawal agreement - rejected three times by MPs - could be replaced with a specific Northern Ireland only ""backstop"" arrangement. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Where might room for backstop compromise lie? Brexit: All you need to know Although official negotiations with the EU have yet to restart, the bloc's new trade commissioner said it was positive the UK seemed prepared to ""accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK"". ""I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions that can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage - albeit at the 11th hour - that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK,"" Ireland's Phil Hogantold the Irish Times,external This video can not be played The prime minister urges a group of primary school pupils ""not to get drunk"" at university Parliament was suspended - or prorogued - at just before 02:00 BST on Tuesday amid noisy protests from opposition MPs. During the five-week suspension, parties will hold their annual conferences but no debates, votes or committee scrutiny sessions will take place. Boris Johnson will not face Prime Minister's Questions until the period is over and his scheduled questioning by the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday has been cancelled. Sarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem chair of the committee, said the PM had gone back on earlier ""reassurances"" that he would appear,telling BBC's Newsnight,externalshe was ""appalled"" that he was ""running away from scrutiny"". Parliament's suspension means MPs will not get a third chance to vote for an early election until they return, meaning a poll would not be possible until November at the earliest. In Monday's latest vote, 293 MPs backed the prime minister's motion for an early election, far short of the two thirds needed. Allow Twitter content?

Labour manifesto unlikely to commit to Leave or Remain Car group boss calls no-deal Brexit a train crash New legislation, which was granted royal assent on Monday, will force the prime minister to seek a delay until 31 January 2020 unless a deal - or a no-deal exit - is approved by MPs by 19 October. Speaking during a visit to a primary school in London, Mr Johnson said getting ready to leave the EU on Halloween was among the ""priorities of the people"". He said there ""were loads of people around the place"", including in Brussels, who wanted to nail down an agreement but he was willing to leave without a deal ""if absolutely necessary"".

Speaking at the TUC Congress on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn said ""our priority is to stop no deal - and then have a general election"". The Lib Dems, meanwhile, are seeking to put distance between themselves and Labour by saying that if they win power at the next election they will have an ""unequivocal"" mandate to cancel Brexit entirely. At their conference on Sunday,members will debate a motion,externalreaffirming their support for a referendum, but also urging the revocation of Article 50 - the legal process for leaving the EU - a week before the Brexit deadline if no deal has been agreed. The prime minister's self-imposed Halloween Brexit deadline looks further out of reach than a few short days ago. Is it impossible? Absolutely not. There is the possibility, still, of a deal, with Number 10 today stressing it is still their primary aim. Whispers again about a Northern Ireland-only backstop, and a bigger role for the Stormont assembly, if it ever gets up and running, are doing the rounds. Some MPs and some diplomats are more cheerful about the possibilities of it working out. If you squint, you can see the chance of an agreement being wrapped up at pace, although it seems the chances range somewhere between slim and negligible. Read more from Laura.

"PM rejects NI-only backstop solution, says DUP","The DUP's meeting with the PM comes as pressure grows on Downing Street to reach a deal with the EU Boris Johnson has confirmed his rejection of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit deadlock, the DUP has said. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party had a ""very good meeting"" with the prime minister in Downing Street. The DUP had insisted the government would not back such a proposal as it would not have ""unionist consent"". In a statement, it said a deal without cross-community support is ""doomed to failure"". Could a no-deal still happen on 31 October? No-deal Brexit 'would be a failure' - Johnson Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Red Lines: Barnier, bigfooting & the backstop In the statement, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister had ""confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland-only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland"". A Number 10 spokesman said the 50-minute meeting was ""positive"". The meeting with Mr Johnson came as pressure grows on Downing Street to reach a deal with the EU ahead of a key summit in October. The prime minister has insisted he will not seek an extension to the Brexit deadline if there is no agreement with the EU. The DUP has said it wants a ""sensible deal"", but will not support any arrangement that could see Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK. Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson met outside Government Buildings in Dublin on Monday In Dublin on Monday, Mr Johnson said he hadan ""abundance of proposals"" to replace the Irish border backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, until a wider solution is found. The idea of a NI-only backstop was first suggested early in the Brexit negotiations. Former PM Theresa May rejected it in 2018 because she relied on the votes of the 10 DUP MPs in Parliament. The Irish government has said it is willing to look at a ""Northern-Ireland specific solution"". On Tuesday, Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan told RTÃ thatthere is ""movement"" happening on both sides,externalof the Brexit negotiations. Proposed by the EU, it would have kept Northern Ireland in the EU's customs union, which would have meant applying EU tariffs for goods entering NI from outside the EU customs union - including Great Britain. It would also have applied EU single market rules for goods and animal products in Northern Ireland. This would have got rid of the need for checks at the Irish border, but would have led to checks on goods passing between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It was criticised by the DUP and other unionist parties for ""creating a border in the Irish Sea"" and posing a risk to the union. In February 2018, Theresa May saidno prime minister could back such a proposal. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The main difference between the original backstop and the agreed solution is in relation to customs. In the backstop agreed by the UK and EU in November 2018, the whole of the UK, would be included in a ""temporary customs territory"" with the EU. Some pro-Brexit MPs claimed the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. It would also see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC the proposal would ""run contrary to the principles at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement that say there should be no change to the relationship between Northern Ireland and Great Britain unless there is consent for it"". ""There would not be unionist consent for such an arrangement."" On Monday night, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party was prepared to look at ""arrangements"" to maintain all-island agri-food regulations - but only under a previously agreed role for the devolved assembly at Stormont. Non-unionist political parties in Northern Ireland support the backstop and would be happy if the UK and EU agreed to an NI-only backstop. The Ulster Unionist Party also opposes a backstop in any form, and claims unionists in Northern Ireland are being ""hung out to dry"". However, business and farming groups in Northern Ireland have urged support for a backstop, saying it is an acceptable way to protect cross-border trade. Johnson's plan for a deal?
