We've been bringing you updates all day from our offices or, because of social distancing measures, from our laptops at home, from Singapore, India, the UK and the US. This was the team behind Thursday's live coverage: Vicky Bissett, Francis Keogh, Mary OâConnor, Joel Gunter, Michael Emons, Kevin Ponniah, Owen Amos, Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Tessa Wong, Sophie Williams, Matthew Henry, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Scott, Max Matza, Jessica Murphy, Doug Faulkner, Rebecca Seales, Lucy Webster, Alix Kroeger, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin.  We're now wrapping up our live page for the evening. Thanks for tuning in. Here's a round-up of what's happened around the world today:  Join us again on Friday, when we'll be bringing you more updates from our teams around the world. ""It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before,"" says Trump of the US economy, as his remarks end. In a veiled dig at China and the World Health Organization, Trump laments that the US government was not sufficiently warned to prepare for the coronavirus. ""I was angry, because it should have been told to us sooner,"" says Trump. ""People should have told us about this. They should've told the rest of the world, too."" Asked if he means China, Trump responds: ""I'm not saying anything."" White House memos show he was first warned of the new virus in January. After moving swiftly to ban travel from China to the US, critics say the Trump administration wasted precious time until mid-March. A reporter asks Trump when he will resume hitting the campaign trail, and he responds: ""I want to make the country better. I donât care about campaigning."" Critics have accused the president of using the White House briefing room as a campaign soap box. His re-election team continues to hold virtual campaign events. Trump says each of the states are different, and make up a ""mosaic"" of readiness to reopen. ""I call it a beautiful puzzle,"" he says of the US map, adding that around 29 states are in good condition to begin reopening soon. On a personal level, he says he knows people who have suffered from the virus. ""I have a number of people who were very great people who were just decimated by what happened,"" he said. He says one person he knows - but does not name - was dead four days after testing positive for Covid-19. Earlier this week the president paid his respects to a New York real estate developer he knew who died with coronavirus. When asked about protesters who have been rallying against lockdown measures from Michigan to North Carolina to Kentucky, President Trump expresses sympathy for them. ""There's death and there's problems in staying at home, too. It's not all 'isn't it wonderful to stay home',"" Trump says. He is asked what his message is for the demonstrators, who are demanding their states reopen. ""They seem to be protesters who like me and express this opinion and my opinion is just about the same as all of the governors,"" he says. He calls on the demonstrators, many of whom carry Trump campaign flags, to heed the guidelines issues by the federal government. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Michigan protesters defy stay-at-home order ""You want to call it the new normal, you can call it whatever want,"" says top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci. ""But it's not game over."" He warns that the virus may rebound, and there could be setbacks along the way. ""It may very well be, as we go this cycle around, that there may be this virus that wants to come back us. ""But I think we can handle it"" until a vaccine is found, he adds. Here are the slides shown at the briefing just now, detailing how the country will be reopening from phase one to three. As states work through the three phases, they may allow for more and more employees to return to work in increments, suggests Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. Phase three, she says, will be the ""new normal"" and will still include suggestions that vulnerable people avoid spending time in crowded spaces. Other people can begin to meet in public, but should still adhere to physcial distancing. Gyms, for instance, can open ""if they adhere to strict social distancing guidelines,"" Dr Birx continues. Dr Deborah Birx Trump has pledged that ""the sacrifices our citizens"" will be ""honoured for generations to come"". He also praised the spirit of bipartisanship that allowed the passage of the massive congressional bailout, and united people across the country. However, it comes hours after he attacked Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Twitter, calling her ""an incompetent, third-rate politician"". In that post, he claimed the California lawmaker had deleted a tweet with a video, taken back in February, where she encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. He claimed that this meant she was ""responsible for many deaths"". However,fact-checkers have found that Trump's claim is untrue,external- because Pelosi never tweeted the video in the first place. The video is a clip from a CBS report on 24 February. San Francisco issued a shelter in place order in mid March. Nancy Pelosi leads the House of Representatives ""We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of glory,"" Trump finishes as he hands over to Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence is now outlining the provisions of the White House plan, called ""Re-Opening Up American Again"". ""Every state is different,"" Trump says, meaning some may open very quickly but others will need more time. He calls on governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do."" He also calls on states to work together with other nearby states to ""harmonise their regional efforts,"" as several have already done. ""We will continue to work with governors to guide them on testing,"" he says. Earlier this week, the president was at loggerheads with state governors about who had the ultimate authority to ease restrictions and reopen businesses. He has since agreed that it is a decision for governors to make, and that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Trump has long been conscious of the impact that the outbreak, and social distancing measures, have had on the US economy. At the briefing, he stresses: ""We're opening up our country... America wants to be open."" ""We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly and that's what's going to happen."" ""We closed our economy in order to win this war. And we are winning it now,"" he adds. Individual states will re-open on different schedules, he adds. More than 20 million people in the US have filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits.  Trump says Americans all over have ""joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt this disease"". He says mitigation efforts prevented worst-case scenarios from coming true. ""It's looking like we will come far under,"" projected death toll figures, he continues. He adds that one death is too many, but overall ""the peak is behind us"". ""A sustained shutdown is not a long term solution,"" he says, before outlining the plan for getting American re-opened. President Trump has begun speaking and is expected to announce his plan for when and how governors should lift lockdown orders in their states. He is joined in the briefing room by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. You can watch it livehere. Trump is now addressing reporters from the White House about his plan to re-start the American economy. We'll bring you more updates shortly. President Trump will announce plans to re-open the US in his briefing - but many US media outlets have already obtained a copy of the new guidelines. TheâOpening Up America Again"" plan,externalincludes three 14-day phases that states should consider implementing as they allow schools and businesses to re-open. The first phase calls for social-distancing measures and for schools and businesses to be shut. If states see a steady decline in cases, they can move to phase two, in which some businesses can open but in a diminished capacity and groups of up to 50 may gather. The third phase calls for workers to fully return to business, and for some at-risk people to continue to take precautions. Visits to hospitals and elderly care homes can begin under phase three. Some large gatherings could begin again as early as 1 May, according to Trump's plan. In a call with state governors earlier today, Trump walked back his earlier claim that he had ""absolute"" power to dictate when states should re-open. Instead, he told governors: ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you. We're going to be supplying you as needed, if you need something that you don't have."" ""You're going to call your own shots,"" Trump added on the call, according to a recording obtained by CBS News. ""We'll be standing right alongside of you and we're going to get our country open and get it working and our people want to get working.""  We're expecting a White House press briefing shortly, where President Donald Trump is expected to give guidelines on reopening the US economy. In the meantime, here's a quick recap of how the outbreak unfolded in the country. 21 January 2020:The first case is reported in the US. The patient is a man in Washington state who had returned from Wuhan. In the days that follow, cases are reported in Illinois, California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, all thought to be related to visits to China 29 January:The government announces a coronavirus task force to handle the outbreak 31 January:The US suspends entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past 14 days. It does not include immediate relatives of American nationals and permanent residents 24 February:President Trump asks Congress for $1.25 billion (Â£1 billion) for the country's response to the virus. 26 February:The US reports its first case of suspected local transmission. 29 February:The first coronavirus death is announced in the country. The government issues ""do not travel"" warnings for countries including China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. 13 March:President Trump declares a national emergency. 17 March:The death toll in the US rises to 100. The deaths were reported in 18 states. 19 March:California becomes first state to order residents to stay at home. 20 March:New York state follows suit, issuing its own stay-at-home order. 22 March:The US records 32,000 cases and at least 400 deaths. 26 March:US confirms 81,321 infections, making it the country with the most confirmed cases. 12 April:The US confirms more than 20,000 deaths. 16 April:President Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases. So far the country has reported over 650,000 cases and over 32,000 deaths. Luiz Henrique Mandetta tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro had handed him his notice Brazil's health minister has been fired by the country's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been at odds for weeks over their differing views on tackling the virus. President Bolsonaro had publicly criticised Luiz Henrique Mandetta for urging people to observe social distancing and stay indoors. The Brazilian leader disagreed with these measures, instead downplaying the virus as ""a little flu"". A total of 1,924 people have died with Covid-19 in Brazil, while the country has had 30,425 confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. However, Brazil tests just under 300 people for every million inhabitants and one group of Brazilian researchers saysthere could be as many as 313,000 cases in Brazil,external.

LiveLiveCoronavirus in Scotland - Another three weeks of lockdown4 hours ago4 hours ago That's it for todayThat's it for today4 hours ago First Minister: Lockdown measures are 'absolutely essential'First Minister: Lockdown measures are 'absolutely essential'4 hours ago When will the lockdown end?When will the lockdown end?,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gives a statement saying that the current stringent measures in force should remain for a further three weeks The UK's coronavirus lockdown measures will be extended for at least three more weeks, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab has announced. A truer picture on fatalities linked to Covid-19 shows that more than 1,000 people have died in Scotland Scotlandâs Championship, League 1 and League 2 football season has come to an end with a majority vote by its members BBC Scotland News Here's a summary of some of Thursday's developments:  We'll be back with live coverage of the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland on Friday morning.     The first minister told Reporting Scotland the coming weeks will involve striking ""a better balance"" than the current lockdown measures. That will inevitably mean using testing, tracing, surveillance, isolating people as well as, perhaps, some continuation of social distancing measures. But we do understand that while these lockdown measures are essential right now, and they are absolutely essential, they have consequences of their own that we have to be mindful of, to the economy and to well being more generally. These are horrendously difficult balances to strike. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dundee, who have been at the centre of the SPFL vote saga, insist their delayed approval has delivered the ""best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed"". The Championship club's intended 'no' vote failed to arrive in time for Friday's suggested deadline, leaving them with the decisive say in the motion to call an end to their division as well as League One and League Two. A 'yes' vote was cast yesterday, making it 35 out of 42 clubs in favour of the measures proposed to help deal with the coronavirus crisis. Dundee say they submitted their vote and issued yesterday's statement ""simultaneously"", adding: ""There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels."" With talks on league reconstruction beginning soon, the latest statement from Dens Park concludes: ""From a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was asked on BBCReporting Scotlandif we can expect the lockdown to last longer than the additional three weeks? The advice is clear. If we lift these restrictions now or too early we risk a resurgence of the virus and a potentially damaging and exponential increase in cases that would cost more lives and potentially overwhelm the NHS. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister All residents in Orkney's
outer isles are being offered Â£5 per week to help out with the cost of food. Travel restrictions mean that
almost three thousand people do not have regular ferry or plane access to reach supermarkets on the Orkney mainland, with shopping in rural shops often more expensive. The money will come from the Scottish government's Â£30n Food Fund at an estimated cost of Â£58,000 for an initial four-week period. Orkney Islands Council has an allocation of Â£99,000, with the remainder to be spent supporting families of children who are eligible for free school meals. Tributes have been paid to a former firefighter who has lost his life to coronavirus. Derek Wilkie had been receiving care an intensive care unit at Raigmore Hospital when he died on Sunday. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said he was a ""larger than life personality"". Mr Wilkie's wife, Janice, is a cancer nurse and his sons work in the health service, one as a paramedic and the other at a medical lab at Raigmore. Read morehere. The first minister says the lockdown is suppressing the virus, but ""we are by no means through this yet"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""This virus is not just going to disappear,"" warns Nicola Sturgeon as she looks ahead to future developments like a vaccine and antibody testing. She applauds the people of Scotland for sticking with the rules and adds that we will get through these difficult times if we stick together. But for the ""foreseeable future"" there will be ""some kind of restriction on our normal way of life"". She gives a broad outline for the future, emphasising the importance of testing and tracing as our understanding of Covid-19 improves and said the Scottish Government would set out more detail about easing the measures in the ""coming days"". ""We don't have all of the answers but we are developing a plan to plot the best way forward,"" she says. The first minister repeats the list of restrictions and says that they cannot be lifted for at least three weeks because all of the progress made would be lost. ""This is a risk we simply cannot take,"" Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we were to lift any of these measures now, we would risk an immediate and potentially exponential resurgence of the virus. And that could result in our NHS being quickly overwhelmed. ""It could result in even more cases in our care homes, and it would also mean much more loss of life. ""It could of course also lead to the reintroduction of even more stringent restrictions in the future and substantially more damage to the economy."" On the extension of the lockdown measures across the UK, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that the early indications are that restrictions have led to a slow down in community transmission. ""The difficult sacrifices you are all making are working,"" she says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms that the current lockdown arrangements must remain in place for another three weeks at least. The foreign secretary says the current lockdown measures will continue for at least three more weeks. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about when the public can see the end of this, Dominic Raab refers to comments made by the prime minister at the beginning of the outbreak, saying this stage should last for three months. ""That is broadly still the outline [and] it will be reviewed at the end of the month,"" he says. But he adds it would be ""irresponsible"" to give a definitive timeframe and could ""prejudice the evidence"" being collected by scientific advisers. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel, there is progress, and we must keep up."" Asked why he won't reveal plans for an exit strategy from social distancing measures, he again says it may prejudice the evidence. ""We have got to keep this up,"" says the foreign secretary. ""What you are doing is working, notwithstanding the death toll - tragic for so many people. ""But if we let up now, it will be damaging for public health and the economy."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor on Drivetime It was very emotive stuff from Dominic Raab. I was really struck by his talk of damage not just to public health but to public health and the economy. He was saying if we don't have the proper constraints then the virus can come roaring back and that will ruin not just the gains in public health but also wreck the economy further  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will give a statement on the extension to coronavirus lockdown measures in Scotland. Her briefing will start soon after 17.30 and will be carried live here. The foreign secretary says he understands people have been comparing the UK's actions with other countries, but the government will ""make decisions at the right time"" for us. He continues: ""I appreciate the impact is considerable on people and businesses across the country. ""We get it, we know it is rough going. Every time I come to this lectern and read out the grim toll, I walk away and think of their sons and daughters going through this right now, their brothers, sisters, grandchildren, all those left behind. ""It makes this government focus even harder on what we must do and I know together, united, we must keep up this national effort."" Dominic Raab says he wants to be ""up front with British people"" about when the government can relax measures. He lists five points that will influence the government's decision: Dominic Raab says there have been indications that social distancing measures in place are showing success. But government advisers say the evidence is ""mixed and inconsistent"", and in some settings infections are increasing. He adds: ""We still don't have infection rates down as much as we need to. ""Any change to social distancing measures now would risk significant increase in infections,"" he says, as well as a second peak and an increase in the number of deaths.

White House defends Ivanka travel amid lockdown,"The president's eldest daughter is a senior White House adviser The White House has defended Ivanka Trump's personal trip to New Jersey last week even as federal guidelines advise Americans to remain at home.

""Her travel was not commercial,"" the White House said. ""She chose to spend a holiday in private with her family."" Both the nation's capital and New Jersey are under stay-at-home orders. Ms Trump, her husband and fellow administration adviser Jared Kushner, and their three children went to ""a closed-down facility considered to be a family home"", the statement to US media said.

Macron questions China's handling of coronavirus,"Macron's remarks came after a row over an article by a Chinese diplomat criticising Western response to coronavirus French President Emmanuel Macron has questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Macron told the Financial Times it was ""naive"" to suggest China had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". More people have died in the US and several European countries than in China where the virus emerged. The US and the UK have also cast doubt on China's figures and the speed with which it responded or alerted others. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's measures. Follow the latest coronavirus updates Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than 145,000 have died. The US,France, Italy and Spain are amongst the worst affected countries. France has seen 141,000 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths. China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted. Local officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate. President Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes. The article - by an unnamed diplomat - was seen by France as a reference to the situation in its care homes,external, which make up a large number of deaths attributed to the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. Hundreds infected on French aircraft carrier French care home fights to keep virus at bay Are EU divisions banished after the coronavirus deal? China dismissed the row as a ""misunderstanding"". Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic ""and has no intention of making any"". Mr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed. ""Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this,"" he said.

There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about."" He said that abandoning freedoms to fight the pandemic would threaten Western democracies. ""We can't accept that. You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis."" Many Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. The UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that ""hard questions"" would have be asked about how the outbreak started ""and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier"". He said there would have to be a ""deep dive"" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be ""business as usual"" after the crisis. US President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China. On Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: ""Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?"" he said, naming China. This video can not be played Donald Trump was recently asked if the virus emanated in a laboratory, rather than market He said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release theory? Fox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols. The Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officialssent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab.,external US intelligence agencies have taken an interest, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said on Tuesday. ""We've had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain."" There is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus was released accidentally from a lab, says the BBC's science editor Paul Rincon. One online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, whonote that studies show the virus originated in animals,external- most likely in bats.

Trump unveils plan to reopen states in phases,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Reopening US 'a beautiful puzzle' As Covid-19 continues to spread across the US, President Donald Trump has given governors guidance on reopening state economies in the coming months. The guidelines for ""Opening up America Again"" outline three phases for states to gradually ease their lockdowns. Mr Trump promised governors they would be handling the process themselves, with help from the federal government. There has been a mixed reception to the plans, with a leading Democrat calling them vague and inconsistent. The US currently has 654,301 confirmed cases and 32,186 deaths due to the virus, and Mr Trump has suggested some states could reopen this month. White House defends Ivanka travel amid lockdown A run through the 'warzone' of New York The daunting reality of getting US back to normal In his daily briefing on Thursday, President Trump declared ""the next front in our war - opening up America again"". ""America wants to be open and Americans want to be open,"" he said. ""A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health He said that a prolonged lockdown risked inflicting a serious toll on public health. He warned of a ""sharp rise"" in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and other ""physical and mental"" problems. Mr Trump told reporters that healthy citizens would be able to return to work ""as conditions allow"". He said Americans would continue to be called upon to maintain social distancing measures and to stay home if they are unwell. New York city has recorded more than 11,000 deaths in the pandemic He said that reopening the US economy would be done ""one careful step at a time"" but he called on state governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do"". Shortly afterwards, leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, called the new guidelines ""vague and inconsistent"". She said the document did ""nothing to make up for the president's failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute national rapid testing"". The administration's 18-page guidance document details three phases to reopen state economies, with each phase lasting, at minimum, 14 days.The guidelines in full can be seen here,external. They include some recommendations across all three phases including good personal hygiene and employers developing policies to ensure social distancing, testing and contact tracing. Phase oneincludes much of the current lockdown measures such as avoiding non-essential travel and not gathering in groups. But it says large venues such as restaurants, places of worship and sports venues ""can operate under strict physical distancing protocols"". If there is no evidence of a resurgence of the coronavirus,phase twoallows non-essential travel to resume. The guidance says schools can reopen and bars can operate ""with diminished standing-room occupancy"". Underphase three, states which are still seeing a downward trend of symptoms and cases can allow ""public interactions"" with physical distancing and the unrestricted staffing of worksites. Visits to care homes and hospitals can resume and bars can increase their standing room capacity. Some regions could begin returning to normal after a month-long evaluation period, at the earliest, according to the document. In places where there are more infections or where rates begin to rise, it could take longer. The co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr Deborah Birx, told Thursday's briefing that as states worked through the three phases, they could allow for more and more employees to return to work in increments. Phase three would be the ""new normal"", she said, and would still include suggestions that vulnerable people should avoid crowded spaces. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The unexpected items deemed ""essential"" The president has argued with governors in recent days about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses - but he has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. During Thursday's call, Mr Trump told governors: ""You're going to call your own shots."" ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you,"" he added. On Wednesday, White House coronavirus task force leader Vice-President Mike Pence said 24% of the counties in the US have had no reported coronavirus cases. He added that half of US states have fewer than 2,500 cases. The Trump administration had previously pencilled in 1 May as a possible date to reopen the nation, and on Wednesday Mr Trump said some states may be able to reopen earlier than that. However, some health experts and state governors have cautioned against reopening the economy too soon. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, told AP news 1 May was ""a bit overly optimistic"" for many areas of the country, as a strong testing and tracing system would be needed before social distancing measures were lifted. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that his state would remain under stay-at-home orders until 15 May. Officials in the state, which is the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, say the situation is showing signs of stabilising this week, though there are still hundreds of deaths daily. The governors of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky have announced they will work together to reopen the region. ""We recognise that our economies are all reliant on each other, and we must work together to safely reopen them so hardworking people can get back to work and businesses can get back on their feet,"" they said in a statement on Thursday. There was no timeline offered, but the governors said they planned to phase in sectors of the economy. In Michigan, which has seen over 1,700 deaths due to the virus, there has been pushback against Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stringent lockdown measures. On Wednesday, residents took to the streets after the governor announced the stay-at-home order would be extended. This video can not be played Michigan residents protest against governor's stay-at-home orders Germany is easing restrictions, shops may open as early as next week Austria has reopened thousands of shops France has extended its lockdown to 11 May Italy is allowing limited number of shops to reopen in less-affected regions India has extended its lockdown until 3 May The UK has extended lockdown for at least three more weeks Denmark has said it intends to ease its lockdown faster than originally planned Spain has allowed some businesses to return to work Poland will begin lifting restrictions this weekend Why is NYC reporting sudden surge in virus deaths?

Six ways lockdown has changed the UK,"Restrictions on daily life in many parts of the UK - to try to curb the spread of coronavirus - have been eased in recent weeks. Employers in England can bring staff back to the workplace and people can use public transport for non-essential journeys (while wearing face coverings). Many pubs, shops and restaurants have reopened, while most of those who have been shielding are no longer advised to stay at home. There are places where the easing of lockdown measures has been halted - Leicester and Greater Manchester, for example. But, overall, how have people in the UK responded? More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Treasury backs loans to bigger businesses,"Loans to all medium-to-large firms will now be included in the government's Â£330bn coronavirus support package for the economy, the Treasury has said. All viable companies with a turnover of more than Â£45m will be able to apply for government-backed support, including those which take in more than Â£500m. Schemes for smaller firms and the largest businesses are already in place. Industry groups welcomed the move. Businesses with turnovers of more than Â£500m were not originally going to be eligible for theCoronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme,external, which will be launched on Monday. The scheme, which will be part of Â£330bn of taxpayer money intended to support the UK economy, will let firms with a turnover of more than Â£45m apply for up to Â£25m of finance from banks. The government will guarantee 80% on those bank loans. Government unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy Will rescue package be enough? Wages, sick pay and time off explained Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I want to ensure that no viable business slips through our safety net of support as we help protect jobs and the economy. That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms. ""This is a national effort and we'll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our Â£330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible."" Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Coronavirus has struck a heavy blow against businesses of all sizes across the UK.

Smaller businesses may be eligible for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. However, the British Chambers of Commerce has said that so far only 2% of UK firms have secured the loans. And some small businesses, which say they are viable,have been unable to get help. The government has also admitted that the small business schemeneeds to work faster.

The largest firms may be able to get Bank of England lending under theCovid Corporate Financing Facility. Business lobby groups welcomed the government announcement of help for medium to large businesses. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI said: ""These measures set out by the chancellor will go a long way to supporting mid-cap companies, some of which are the UK's most important and iconic regional employers. ""This scheme is clearly targeted at helping several thousand mid-tier firms, rather than those already up and running for small and larger businesses."" Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the changes ""fill an important gap in government support, and could make a real difference to medium-sized and larger-firms navigating challenging circumstances"". ""It's now crucial to ensure that this enhanced support reaches companies in difficulty as quickly as possible,"" he said. Stephen Phipson, Make UK's chief executive, said: ""The situation remains fluid and as we assess the detail we will continue to work closely with the Treasury to ensure those companies who need support can turn on the tap when needed."" And Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""The government deserves credit for showing willingness to continue to adapt its coronavirus response."" Governments and institutions around the world have scrambled to try to cushion economies from the effects of the coronavirus crisis. For example, last week the European Union agreed a â¬500bn rescue packagefor European countries hit hard by the pandemic.In March the IMF announced $50bn (Â£39bn) of supportfor countries hit by the coronavirusandthe US passed a $2tn disaster aid bill.

Ventilator built by Airbus and F1 approved for use,"About 1,500 Penlon Prima ESO2s a week will be made by May The first new medical ventilator to treat people with severe symptoms of Covid-19 has been approved in the UK. Hundreds of the Penlon Prima ESO2, which is an updated version of an existing model, are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. But the consortium of major firms that helped to develop it hopes to make about 1,500 a week by the start of May. The government has said it needs to increase ventilator stocks from 10,000 to 18,000 to cope with the pandemic. But some have castdoubt on whether it can meet this goal fast enough. On Thursday, following the approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),the government said it had confirmed an order for 15,000,externalof the new Penlon devices. A Cabinet Office spokesman said the devices would be delivered over the coming months and it would continue to consider additional bids from other consortiums. Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove said it showed ""the significant progress being made"" after big manufacturers were asked to help ramp up production. What are ventilators and how do they work? F1 firms help make hospital ventilators operational Manufacturers cast doubt on ventilator target Firms including Siemens, Airbus, Ford and a number of Formula 1 teams worked with Penlon, a medical device maker, to adapt its ventilator so that it could be mass-produced at speed. Under normal circumstances, Penlon would only be able to make 50 to 60 ventilators a week. In line with updated MHRA rules, the ESO2 can also be switched on and off more easily, allowing liquid to be regularly drained from patients' lungs - something the sickest Covid-19 patients can require on an hourly basis. Dick Elsy, chair of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium which is making the device, said it had undergone ""stringent testing and clinical trials for the last two weeks"". ""Ventilators of this type are complex and critical pieces of medical equipment, so ensuring the absolute adherence to regulatory standards and meeting clinical needs were always our priorities,"" he said. Airbus' Broughton site, which makes wings for commercial aircraft, Ford's Dagenham engine factory and McLaren's Woking site are helping to produce the ESO2. The consortium also said it was ramping up production of another existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, which is used for less acute patients. A number of other businesses are also involved in designing new ventilators, including Dyson. However, the government recently abandoned plans to buy a device developed by a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula one teams, because it was not considered suitable for treating Covid-19 patients. It is exactly a month since the government appealed to businesses across the UK for help manufacturing ventilators and components for the NHS. Since then there has been some progress - production of an existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, is already being ramped up. And the Mercedes F1 team has been building a simpler breathing aid in large quantities. But until today none of the much-hyped new designs had received official approval - and the government was facing criticism in some quarters for initially specifying machines that were allegedly ill-suited to the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Now production of the Penlon-designed machine can begin in earnest, drawing on the combined know-how of companies such as Airbus, Ford and McLaren. The government had been expected to buy about 5,000 of the machines. In fact, it's ordered 15,000 - a measure perhaps of its relief that deliveries to the NHS can now start in earnest.

Facebook alters virus policy after damning report,"Facebook is changing how it treats Covid-19 misinformation after a damning report into its handling of the virus. Users who have read, watched or shared false coronavirus content will receive a pop-up alert urging them to go the World Health Organisation's website. A study had indicated Facebook was frequently failing to clamp down on false posts, particularly when they were in languages other than English. Facebook said the research did not reflect the work it had done recently. The California tech firm says it will start showing the messages at the top of news feeds ""in the coming weeks"". A spokesman for Facebook said it did not recognise the alerts as a being a change of policy, but instead told the BBC they were ""operational changes to the platform"". The messages will direct people to aWorld Health Organisation webpage,externalwhere myths are debunked. A Facebook spokesman said the move will ""connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources, in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook"". The changes have been prompted by a major study of misinformation on the platform across six languages by Avaaz, a crowdfunded activist group. Researchers say millions of Facebook users continue to be exposed to coronavirus misinformation, without any warning on the platform. The group found some of the most dangerous falsehoods had received hundreds of thousands of views, including claims like ""black people are resistant to coronavirus"" and ""Coronavirus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide"". Avaaz researchers analysed a sample of more than 100 pieces of Facebook coronavirus misinformation on the website's English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Italian and French versions. The research found that: It can take the company up to 22 days to issue warning labels for coronavirus misinformation, with delays even when Facebook partners had flagged the harmful content for the platform. 29% of false content in the sample was not labelled at all on the English language version of the website It is worse in some other languages, with 68% of Italian-language content, 70% of Spanish-language content, and 50% of Portuguese-language content not labelled as false Facebook's Arabic language efforts are more successful, with only 22% of the sample of misleading posts remaining unlabelled. Facebook says it is continuing to expand its multilingual network of fact-checkers issuing grants and partnering with trusted organisations in more than 50 languages. Fadi Quran, Campaign Director at Avaaz said: ""Facebook sits at the epicenter of the misinformation crisis. ""But the company is turning a critical corner today to clean up this toxic information ecosystem, becoming the first social media platform to alert all users who have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation, and directing them to life-saving facts."" One of the falsehoods that researchers tracked was the claim that people could rid the body of the virus by drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar. The post was shared more than 31,000 times before eventually being taken down after Avaaz flagged it to Facebook. However, more than 2,600 clones of the post remain on the platform, with nearly 100,000 interactions and most of these cloned posts have no warning labels from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, defended his company's work in an online post saying: ""On Facebook and Instagram, we've now directed more than two billion people to authoritative health resources via our Covid-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups, with more than 350 million people clicking through to learn more. ""If a piece of content contains harmful misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, then we'll take it down. We've taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation related to Covid-19, including theories like drinking bleach cures the virus or that physical distancing is ineffective at preventing the disease from spreading. For other misinformation, once it is rated false by fact-checkers, we reduce its distribution, apply warning labels with more context and find duplicates."" Mr Zuckerberg insists that warning pop-ups are working, with 95% of users choosing to not view the content when presented with the labels. ""I think this latest step is a good move from Facebook and we've seen a much more proactive stance to misinformation in this pandemic than during other situations like the US elections"", says Emily Taylor, associate fellow at Chatham House and an expert at social media misinformation. ""We don't know if it will make a huge difference but it's got to be worth a try because the difference between misinformation in a health crisis and an election is literally that lives are at stake,"" she said.

EasyJet to leave middle plane seats empty,"Socially distanced? EasyJet plans to leave the middle seat on planes empty EasyJet plans to keep the middle seat on its planes empty to allow for social distancing once the Covid-19 lockdown has been lifted. The airline grounded its entire fleet at the end of March. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren expects the seating measure will encourage more people to fly. ""That is something that we will do because I think that is something that the customers would like to see,"" he said. ""Then we will work out with the authorities and listen to the customers' views and points on what they believe is the right thing to do, particularly in the start-up period."" EasyJet later said the idea was one suggested measure that could be undertaken ""for a short period while flying was resuming"". Coronavirus: 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' Commenting on how social distancing on its planes would work, Mr Lundgren said passengers would sit next to the window or the aisle in a three-seat configuration. He said the airline would be able to implement the measure because he did not expect EasyJet's aircraft to be full immediately after the lockdown is lifted. ""I'm talking about this as an initial phase. Nobody knows for how long that phase will be,"" he said. ""I think it's important that customers understand that we are taking this very seriously, and first and foremost, our concern is about the customers' well-being and our people's well-being."" Mr Lundgren said bookings for winter flights were ahead of last year, helped by customers who had rebooked tickets after the coronavirus disrupted their travel plans. However, EasyJet has beencriticised by customers who have had difficulty in getting refunds. Rebooking is done online, but refunds require people calling the airline's busy customer services department. Looking ahead, EasyJet has reduced costs through a number of measures, including deferring the delivery of 24 new aircraft from planemaker Airbus. EasyJet also revealed that it expects to report a pre-tax loss between Â£360m and Â£380m for the first half of its financial year. The airline will incur significant fuel costs because it has already bought jet fuel for its planes, with no certainty of when they will fly again. EasyJet grounded its planes a week after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK Covid-19 lockdown on 23 March. The company had a full roster of pilots and staff during that period when many flights were being cancelled, leading to a rise in costs. It also only started furloughing staff after the end of March. It said it had a cash balance of around Â£3.3bn and based on a number of scenarios, it would have enough reserves to ""remain liquid"", should its jets stay grounded for nine months. The airline said: ""At this stage, given the level of continued uncertainty, it is not possible to provide financial guidance for the remainder of the financial year. ""However, we continue to take every step necessary to reduce cost, conserve cash burn, enhance liquidity, protect the business and ensure it is best positioned for a return to flying.""

"Ventilator built by Airbus and F1 approved for useAbout 1,500 of the adapted devices will be made each week by the start of May, developers say.BusinessComments","About 1,500 Penlon Prima ESO2s a week will be made by May The first new medical ventilator to treat people with severe symptoms of Covid-19 has been approved in the UK. Hundreds of the Penlon Prima ESO2, which is an updated version of an existing model, are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. But the consortium of major firms that helped to develop it hopes to make about 1,500 a week by the start of May. The government has said it needs to increase ventilator stocks from 10,000 to 18,000 to cope with the pandemic. But some have castdoubt on whether it can meet this goal fast enough. On Thursday, following the approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),the government said it had confirmed an order for 15,000,externalof the new Penlon devices. A Cabinet Office spokesman said the devices would be delivered over the coming months and it would continue to consider additional bids from other consortiums. Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove said it showed ""the significant progress being made"" after big manufacturers were asked to help ramp up production. What are ventilators and how do they work? F1 firms help make hospital ventilators operational Manufacturers cast doubt on ventilator target Firms including Siemens, Airbus, Ford and a number of Formula 1 teams worked with Penlon, a medical device maker, to adapt its ventilator so that it could be mass-produced at speed. Under normal circumstances, Penlon would only be able to make 50 to 60 ventilators a week. In line with updated MHRA rules, the ESO2 can also be switched on and off more easily, allowing liquid to be regularly drained from patients' lungs - something the sickest Covid-19 patients can require on an hourly basis. Dick Elsy, chair of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium which is making the device, said it had undergone ""stringent testing and clinical trials for the last two weeks"". ""Ventilators of this type are complex and critical pieces of medical equipment, so ensuring the absolute adherence to regulatory standards and meeting clinical needs were always our priorities,"" he said. Airbus' Broughton site, which makes wings for commercial aircraft, Ford's Dagenham engine factory and McLaren's Woking site are helping to produce the ESO2. The consortium also said it was ramping up production of another existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, which is used for less acute patients. A number of other businesses are also involved in designing new ventilators, including Dyson. However, the government recently abandoned plans to buy a device developed by a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula one teams, because it was not considered suitable for treating Covid-19 patients. It is exactly a month since the government appealed to businesses across the UK for help manufacturing ventilators and components for the NHS. Since then there has been some progress - production of an existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, is already being ramped up. And the Mercedes F1 team has been building a simpler breathing aid in large quantities. But until today none of the much-hyped new designs had received official approval - and the government was facing criticism in some quarters for initially specifying machines that were allegedly ill-suited to the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Now production of the Penlon-designed machine can begin in earnest, drawing on the combined know-how of companies such as Airbus, Ford and McLaren. The government had been expected to buy about 5,000 of the machines. In fact, it's ordered 15,000 - a measure perhaps of its relief that deliveries to the NHS can now start in earnest.

Facebook alerts users exposed to virus fake newsAn independent report brands the platform 'an epicentre of coronavirus misinformation'.,"Facebook is changing how it treats Covid-19 misinformation after a damning report into its handling of the virus. Users who have read, watched or shared false coronavirus content will receive a pop-up alert urging them to go the World Health Organisation's website. A study had indicated Facebook was frequently failing to clamp down on false posts, particularly when they were in languages other than English. Facebook said the research did not reflect the work it had done recently. The California tech firm says it will start showing the messages at the top of news feeds ""in the coming weeks"". A spokesman for Facebook said it did not recognise the alerts as a being a change of policy, but instead told the BBC they were ""operational changes to the platform"". The messages will direct people to aWorld Health Organisation webpage,externalwhere myths are debunked. A Facebook spokesman said the move will ""connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources, in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook"". The changes have been prompted by a major study of misinformation on the platform across six languages by Avaaz, a crowdfunded activist group. Researchers say millions of Facebook users continue to be exposed to coronavirus misinformation, without any warning on the platform. The group found some of the most dangerous falsehoods had received hundreds of thousands of views, including claims like ""black people are resistant to coronavirus"" and ""Coronavirus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide"". Avaaz researchers analysed a sample of more than 100 pieces of Facebook coronavirus misinformation on the website's English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Italian and French versions. The research found that: It can take the company up to 22 days to issue warning labels for coronavirus misinformation, with delays even when Facebook partners had flagged the harmful content for the platform. 29% of false content in the sample was not labelled at all on the English language version of the website It is worse in some other languages, with 68% of Italian-language content, 70% of Spanish-language content, and 50% of Portuguese-language content not labelled as false Facebook's Arabic language efforts are more successful, with only 22% of the sample of misleading posts remaining unlabelled. Facebook says it is continuing to expand its multilingual network of fact-checkers issuing grants and partnering with trusted organisations in more than 50 languages. Fadi Quran, Campaign Director at Avaaz said: ""Facebook sits at the epicenter of the misinformation crisis. ""But the company is turning a critical corner today to clean up this toxic information ecosystem, becoming the first social media platform to alert all users who have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation, and directing them to life-saving facts."" One of the falsehoods that researchers tracked was the claim that people could rid the body of the virus by drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar. The post was shared more than 31,000 times before eventually being taken down after Avaaz flagged it to Facebook. However, more than 2,600 clones of the post remain on the platform, with nearly 100,000 interactions and most of these cloned posts have no warning labels from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, defended his company's work in an online post saying: ""On Facebook and Instagram, we've now directed more than two billion people to authoritative health resources via our Covid-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups, with more than 350 million people clicking through to learn more. ""If a piece of content contains harmful misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, then we'll take it down. We've taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation related to Covid-19, including theories like drinking bleach cures the virus or that physical distancing is ineffective at preventing the disease from spreading. For other misinformation, once it is rated false by fact-checkers, we reduce its distribution, apply warning labels with more context and find duplicates."" Mr Zuckerberg insists that warning pop-ups are working, with 95% of users choosing to not view the content when presented with the labels. ""I think this latest step is a good move from Facebook and we've seen a much more proactive stance to misinformation in this pandemic than during other situations like the US elections"", says Emily Taylor, associate fellow at Chatham House and an expert at social media misinformation. ""We don't know if it will make a huge difference but it's got to be worth a try because the difference between misinformation in a health crisis and an election is literally that lives are at stake,"" she said.

Results days announced for GCSE and A-level grades,"Grades for cancelled GCSEs and A-level exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will now be published on their original planned results days. Grades are going to be decided by teachers' assessments - with an initial suggestion that results could be issued earlier than usual this year. But A-level results will be published on 13 August and GCSEs on 20 August. England's School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said it would give pupils some ""reassurance and clarity"". In Wales, Minister for Education Kirsty Williams, said the confirmation of dates would allow students ""to make future plans with a little more confidence, although I recognise this continues to be a time of great uncertainty"". After schools were closed by the coronavirus, exams due to be taken this summer were cancelled. As a replacement, exam boards are gathering assessments from teachers about what they expected pupils to achieve and these predictions will be moderated so the overall national results and shares of grades are in line with previous years. How teachers will grade students for cancelled exams Teachers to estimate exam grades in Scotland Further exams cancelled in Northern Ireland Teachers' predictions will be based on an overall professional judgement, using the evidence of previous exams, coursework, essays, homework and mock exams. For those pupils in England who think they would have done better in an exam, there is the promise of another exam that can be taken in the autumn. But for A-level students planning to use their results to go to university, or deciding whether to defer a year, it is still uncertain whether university campuses will reopen in the autumn or will be teaching online.

EU offers 'heartfelt apology' to Italy over virus,"The EU Commission president said ""too many were not there"" when Italy needed The EU Commission president has offered a ""heartfelt apology"" to Italy for not helping at the start of its deadly coronavirus outbreak. Ursula von der Leyen told the EU parliament that ""too many were not there... when Italy needed"". Many Italians have criticised the EU's response to the pandemic, and say the bloc did not do enough to help. The country has recorded more than 21,000 deaths from the virus, the highest toll in Europe. Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has welcomed Ms von der Leyen's comments, calling them ""an important act of truth"". Last weekPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC the EU could failif it did not find a way to respond to the virus, saying the bloc must rise to meet the challenge of ""the biggest test since the Second World War"". Speaking at a mostly-empty session of the European Parliament in Brussels, Ms von der Leyen said you could not beat a pandemic ""without the truth"" - about science but also ""about our own actions"". ""Yes it is true that no one was really ready for this. It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning,"" she said. ""For that, it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology."" Are EU divisions banished after the coronavirus deal? Financial crisis 'on steroids' facing EU leaders The commission president added that sorry ""only counts for something if it changes behaviour."" ""The truth is that now Europe has now become the true beating heart of solidarity. The true Europe is now standing up."" This video can not be played Italyâs lockdown puts restaurants out of business Responding on Facebook, Mr Di Maio said her statement was ""good for Europe and for our community"". ""Now the European Union has the courage to defend and protect all peoples,"" he wrote, adding that ""Defending Italy we also defend the integrity of the EU"". Last weekEU finance ministers agreed to a â¬500 billion stimulus packagefor European countries hit hard by the outbreak. Italy's Prime Minister Mr Conte has said he will not agree to the deal unless it includes a way to share debt among members - something northern EU members like the Netherlands and Germany staunchly oppose. This is a significant acknowledgement from the most powerful person in Brussels. A formal recognition that in the panic of the moment when Italy most needed help, the famed EU ""spirit of solidarity"" did not show itself. It was a difficult moment for Ursula von der Leyen to raise. She is a leader who has shown great care in past weeks to avoid internal conflict and who has championed pragmatism and hope.  But it seems an underlying rancour is still felt by Italians and others who feel there were too few good Samaritans when it counted - and it counted in early March, when Italy was the only country that had enforced a lockdown. Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte urgently requested medical equipment for hospital staff such as gloves and clothing as well as ventilators and testing kits, but it took several days before there was a response from any European government. The actions of Germany, France and the Czech Republic in particular caused unease, when they decided to block exports of emergency equipment to neighbours in need, until they had finished counting up what stocks they had. Even the usually conciliatory Belgian Health Minister Maggie De Block stated that it seemed ""deeply against the the idea of a united Europe and fundamentally against the spirit of solidarity"".

Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic',"A leaked letter seen by the BBC has revealed an extensive list of concerns about how the social care sector is coping with the coronavirus crisis. The letter raises fears about funding, testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the shielding scheme for vulnerable people. Written on Saturday, to a senior official at the Department of Health and Social Care by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), it says mixed messages from the government have created ""confusion and additional workload"". On protective equipment for care workers, the letter says the national handling has been ""shambolic"". Early drops of equipment have been ""paltry"" and more recent deliveries have been ""haphazard"", with some even being confiscated by border control for the NHS. The letter says there have been contradictory messages from the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department of Health on theshielding schemefor people particularly at risk from the illness. And while the rollout of testing for care workers has been generally welcomed, the letter states ""testing for care workers appears to be being rolled out without being given thought to who is going to be tested and what we are going to do with the result"". Adass is a charity that supports members from all 151 local authorities in England with responsibility for adult social care. Virus tests promised for care homes Close family to be allowed coronavirus goodbyes 'Less than half' of council's PPE order delivered The organisation is also critical of the way central government has recruited volunteers, saying the national scheme has ""diverted 750,000 volunteers away from supporting local communities and left them with nothing to do for the first three weeks"", and claiming it was ""shameful that this was not done in collaboration with local government"". While the letter, alsoreported in the Local Government Chronicle,external, welcomes some of the guidance given by Whitehall, it raises significant concerns about the interaction between central government and local government. It suggests the sector had to make ""invidious decisions before the pandemic"" and now is not being given the same consideration as the NHS. ""We are very concerned that there is a significant imbalance between listening, hearing, and understanding NHS England as opposed to social care,"" it says. The social care system helps and looks after older and disabled people in residential centres and in their own homes. There are more than 400,000 residents in care homes in 15,000 locations in England. Adass has broadly welcomed thehealth secretary's plan to help social care, which was announced on Wednesday. Matt Hancock announced that all care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for coronavirus, as well as any new care home residents being discharged from hospital into care. But senior figures in the care sector say there is scepticism about whether the commitments can be delivered. Responding to Mr Hancock's announcements, Adass said: ""We now have a national strategy; the challenge is now to implement it. Any strategy will ultimately be judged by actions it produces, not words it contains."" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said: ""It's absolutely true that we need to do more - that's why we put the next stages of our action plan out... so we can test all people going from hospital into care homes."" He said that 15% of care homes in the UK have two or more cases of Covid-19. When challenged on that figure - one care home boss, for example, says two thirds of his homes are infected - Mr Hancock said it was a ""robust figure"". He told BBC Breakfast that ""what really matters is availability of testing now in social care"" where he said more than 10,000 tests of residents had been undertaken. Mr Hancock also said his latest figures showed 1,500 care workers were tested on Tuesday, while 4,100 workers have the test ""immediately available to them"". A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the government's plan in England included ""ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes and helping to minimise the spread of the virus to keep people safe"". ""We will continue to work closely with the social care sector to ensure they have everything they need to respond to this outbreak and receive the recognition they deserve,"" they added. The government has also said it is ""committed to ensuring that all areas have access to PPE"" and is ""working round the clock"" with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure supply. It said 38 million items of PPE had been delivered to local resilience forums - multi-agency groups of emergency services and agencies - since last week. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the concerns raised in the letter were ""extremely worrying"". ""Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn't been properly thought through must be an urgent wake up call for ministers,"" she added. ""Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary to halt the emerging crisis in social care.""

Facebook alerts users exposed to virus fake news,"Facebook is changing how it treats Covid-19 misinformation after a damning report into its handling of the virus. Users who have read, watched or shared false coronavirus content will receive a pop-up alert urging them to go the World Health Organisation's website. A study had indicated Facebook was frequently failing to clamp down on false posts, particularly when they were in languages other than English. Facebook said the research did not reflect the work it had done recently. The California tech firm says it will start showing the messages at the top of news feeds ""in the coming weeks"". A spokesman for Facebook said it did not recognise the alerts as a being a change of policy, but instead told the BBC they were ""operational changes to the platform"". The messages will direct people to aWorld Health Organisation webpage,externalwhere myths are debunked. A Facebook spokesman said the move will ""connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources, in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook"". The changes have been prompted by a major study of misinformation on the platform across six languages by Avaaz, a crowdfunded activist group. Researchers say millions of Facebook users continue to be exposed to coronavirus misinformation, without any warning on the platform. The group found some of the most dangerous falsehoods had received hundreds of thousands of views, including claims like ""black people are resistant to coronavirus"" and ""Coronavirus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide"". Avaaz researchers analysed a sample of more than 100 pieces of Facebook coronavirus misinformation on the website's English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Italian and French versions. The research found that: It can take the company up to 22 days to issue warning labels for coronavirus misinformation, with delays even when Facebook partners had flagged the harmful content for the platform. 29% of false content in the sample was not labelled at all on the English language version of the website It is worse in some other languages, with 68% of Italian-language content, 70% of Spanish-language content, and 50% of Portuguese-language content not labelled as false Facebook's Arabic language efforts are more successful, with only 22% of the sample of misleading posts remaining unlabelled. Facebook says it is continuing to expand its multilingual network of fact-checkers issuing grants and partnering with trusted organisations in more than 50 languages. Fadi Quran, Campaign Director at Avaaz said: ""Facebook sits at the epicenter of the misinformation crisis. ""But the company is turning a critical corner today to clean up this toxic information ecosystem, becoming the first social media platform to alert all users who have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation, and directing them to life-saving facts."" One of the falsehoods that researchers tracked was the claim that people could rid the body of the virus by drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar. The post was shared more than 31,000 times before eventually being taken down after Avaaz flagged it to Facebook. However, more than 2,600 clones of the post remain on the platform, with nearly 100,000 interactions and most of these cloned posts have no warning labels from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, defended his company's work in an online post saying: ""On Facebook and Instagram, we've now directed more than two billion people to authoritative health resources via our Covid-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups, with more than 350 million people clicking through to learn more. ""If a piece of content contains harmful misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, then we'll take it down. We've taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation related to Covid-19, including theories like drinking bleach cures the virus or that physical distancing is ineffective at preventing the disease from spreading. For other misinformation, once it is rated false by fact-checkers, we reduce its distribution, apply warning labels with more context and find duplicates."" Mr Zuckerberg insists that warning pop-ups are working, with 95% of users choosing to not view the content when presented with the labels. ""I think this latest step is a good move from Facebook and we've seen a much more proactive stance to misinformation in this pandemic than during other situations like the US elections"", says Emily Taylor, associate fellow at Chatham House and an expert at social media misinformation. ""We don't know if it will make a huge difference but it's got to be worth a try because the difference between misinformation in a health crisis and an election is literally that lives are at stake,"" she said.

"Major UK takeaway chains start to reopenBurger King, KFC and Pret A Manger announce limited openings after shutting at the lockdown's start.","Three major takeaway chains in the UK have announced limited reopening programmes after closing during the coronavirus lockdown. Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger are opening certain restaurants around the country for delivery only. Government guidelines state that while restaurants and pubs have to close, they can prepare food for collection or delivery. The chains had decided to temporarily close as the lockdown took effect. Burger King is to reopen four restaurants: two in Bristol, one in Coventry, and one in Swindon, with a pared-down menu. Staff will wear masks and gloves and will be trained in running delivery-only kitchens hygienically, the fast food chain said. There will be stringent cleaning measures, and staff will get social distancing training. The restaurants will also donate 1,000 meals per week to staff working at NHS hospitals in the vicinity of the reopened restaurants. Katie Evans, marketing director at the chain, said Burger King hoped the re-openings would go ""some way to lifting our customers' spirits in these difficult times"". She added: ""We want to demonstrate how appreciative everyone at Burger King UK is of [NHS staff] efforts in these unprecedented times."" KFC said it had reopened 11 UK restaurants in the past week for delivery only, with a limited menu. The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. The fast food chain says it has donated ""thousands of meals from all our open restaurants to those on the frontline, including the NHS and key workers, in partnership with Deliveroo, and will continue to do so each week whilst the situation continues"". KFC said it had decided to close temporarily on 23 March ""with the wellbeing of our teams and guests in mind"". A spokesperson said: ""We've spent the time since closure developing new processes to ensure we can reopen carefully and responsibly, which we've now started to do. ""We also saw the impact the situation is having on those who may not be able to easily get to the supermarkets, like key workers. There's a need for affordable, accessible food and we wanted to do our part."" The spokesperson added that furloughed staff would find their jobs ""waiting for them when we are able to fully reopen"". Pret a Manger will reopen 10 shop kitchens near London hospitals from Thursday. ""This allows us to also get our supply chain up and running to donate food to homeless charities, so we will be donating 7,000 additional meals per week to our homeless charity partners,"" the chain said in a statement. NHS workers will get half-price food until the end of April. Pret's chief executive officer Pano Christou wrote in a blog post that NHS workers and hospitals want to be able to get ""freshly made food nearby"". ""We are incredibly grateful that 160 team members have volunteered to help reopen 10 shops in London, located close to hospitals."" Food delivery firm Deliveroo has raised more than Â£1.5m from customer donations and corporate funding for free meals for NHS workers. While the business declined to reveal overall order volumes, it said 3,000 new restaurants had signed up in March. Areport in the Financial Times,externalin March suggested that delivery apps could be feeling the pinch due to restaurant closures and as coronavirus anxiety continues. However, Deliveroo said it is seeing more orders from families, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. The majority of dishes it delivers are pizza, fish and chips, and burgers, it said. It added that it had also started to deliver food from stores including Morrisons, McColls, M&S and BP service stations. Rival delivery firm Just Eat also said that about 3,000 takeaways had signed up since the lockdown was announced. The firm has seen a 36% rise in orders for desserts, and said customers are ordering food earlier in the day, and earlier in the week. While fast food is very popular in the UK, there have been warnings about its effects on people's health for a number of years. In February, BBC One documentary ""The Truth About Takeaways"" found that over two weeks of eating two fast food meals per day, participants gained body fat, which is a marker for increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Eating two takeaways per week ""is associated with increased body weight and various cardiovascular risk markers"", Dr Ian G Davies, Reader in Nutritional Science at Liverpool John Moores University, told the programme. In general, pizza has the highest salt, fat and energy density compared with other fast foods. Shoppers stock up on alcohol amid pub shutdown Why is it so hard to buy flour at the moment?

"Ventilator built by Airbus and F1 approved for useAbout 1,500 of the adapted devices will be made each week by the start of May, developers say.Business","About 1,500 Penlon Prima ESO2s a week will be made by May The first new medical ventilator to treat people with severe symptoms of Covid-19 has been approved in the UK. Hundreds of the Penlon Prima ESO2, which is an updated version of an existing model, are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. But the consortium of major firms that helped to develop it hopes to make about 1,500 a week by the start of May. The government has said it needs to increase ventilator stocks from 10,000 to 18,000 to cope with the pandemic. But some have castdoubt on whether it can meet this goal fast enough. On Thursday, following the approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),the government said it had confirmed an order for 15,000,externalof the new Penlon devices. A Cabinet Office spokesman said the devices would be delivered over the coming months and it would continue to consider additional bids from other consortiums. Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove said it showed ""the significant progress being made"" after big manufacturers were asked to help ramp up production. What are ventilators and how do they work? F1 firms help make hospital ventilators operational Manufacturers cast doubt on ventilator target Firms including Siemens, Airbus, Ford and a number of Formula 1 teams worked with Penlon, a medical device maker, to adapt its ventilator so that it could be mass-produced at speed. Under normal circumstances, Penlon would only be able to make 50 to 60 ventilators a week. In line with updated MHRA rules, the ESO2 can also be switched on and off more easily, allowing liquid to be regularly drained from patients' lungs - something the sickest Covid-19 patients can require on an hourly basis. Dick Elsy, chair of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium which is making the device, said it had undergone ""stringent testing and clinical trials for the last two weeks"". ""Ventilators of this type are complex and critical pieces of medical equipment, so ensuring the absolute adherence to regulatory standards and meeting clinical needs were always our priorities,"" he said. Airbus' Broughton site, which makes wings for commercial aircraft, Ford's Dagenham engine factory and McLaren's Woking site are helping to produce the ESO2. The consortium also said it was ramping up production of another existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, which is used for less acute patients. A number of other businesses are also involved in designing new ventilators, including Dyson. However, the government recently abandoned plans to buy a device developed by a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula one teams, because it was not considered suitable for treating Covid-19 patients. It is exactly a month since the government appealed to businesses across the UK for help manufacturing ventilators and components for the NHS. Since then there has been some progress - production of an existing design, the Smiths Group paraPAC, is already being ramped up. And the Mercedes F1 team has been building a simpler breathing aid in large quantities. But until today none of the much-hyped new designs had received official approval - and the government was facing criticism in some quarters for initially specifying machines that were allegedly ill-suited to the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Now production of the Penlon-designed machine can begin in earnest, drawing on the combined know-how of companies such as Airbus, Ford and McLaren. The government had been expected to buy about 5,000 of the machines. In fact, it's ordered 15,000 - a measure perhaps of its relief that deliveries to the NHS can now start in earnest.

Trump says virus has 'passed the peak' in US,"This video can not be played Michigan residents protest against governor's stay-at-home orders President Donald Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases and predicted some states would reopen this month. Mr Trump told the daily White House briefing that new guidelines would be announced on Thursday after he had spoken to governors. ""We'll be the comeback kids, all of us,"" the president said. ""We want to get our country back."" The US has nearly 640,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 30,900 deaths. Mr Trump's comments came afterNew York City reported a rise in virus fatalities to 10,367. The president has been at loggerheads with state governors about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses. He has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Follow live updates on coronavirus Lessons from Japan's second wave of infections The Trump administration had previously pencilled in 1 May as a possible date to reopen the nation, and on Wednesday Mr Trump said some states may be able to reopen earlier than that. However, some health experts and state governors have cautioned against re-opening the economy too soon. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the 1 May date was ""a bit overly optimistic"" for many areas of the country, as a strong testing and tracing system was needed before social distancing measures are lifted. ""The data suggests that nationwide, we have passed the peak of new cases,"" Mr Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. ""Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress."" The co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, Deborah Birx, said there had been a national decline in confirmed new daily cases from the recorded peak in recent days. Asked why the US accounted for such a significant proportion of the global coronavirus death toll of more than 137,000, Mr Trump accused other countries of lying about their mortality rate. ""Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?"" he said, naming China. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China must show ""full transparency"" on coronavirus, during a call with his Beijing counterpart, Yang Jiechi, the Department of State said. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Mr Pompeo has repeatedly accused Beijing of covering up the scale of the outbreak in the early days, which China denies. President Trump said the US was looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, rather than in a market in the city. ""I will tell you more and more we're hearing the story and we'll see,"" Mr Trump said when asked about the claims at his daily briefing. This video can not be played Trump says the US is investigating claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab A Fox News report, attributed to several unnamed sources, suggests that the coronavirus was a naturally occurring pathogen that leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols, infecting an intern, who then transmitted it to her boyfriend. US media have previously reported that the US embassy in Beijing had raised concerns about safety at two laboratories in Wuhan in recent years. On Tuesday,the Washington Post said it had obtained cables,externaldating from 2018 warning that one facility was studying bat coronaviruses and looking at the possibility of human transmission, adding that the laboratory had ""a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians"". One theory is that coronavirus originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province However Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that US intelligence services believed it was more likely that the virus occurred naturally. ""There's a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide variety of media... we've taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,"" he said, adding: ""The weight of evidence seems to indicate natural."" Scientists attempting to trace the source of the outbreak have said that a range of wild animal species could be the host, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses. They have been trying to ascertain if the virus that causes the disease Covid-19 originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. When questioned about the dangers of reopening too soon, Mr Trump said: ""There's also death involved in keeping it closed."" He cited mental health issues, saying suicide hotlines were ""exploding"" as the economy froze. However the governor of Maryland, Republican Larry Hogan, said on Thursday that now ""would be the worst possible time"" to roll back social distancing in his state. ""Everybody wants to get out economy back,"" he told NBC, but he had to ensure ""we're not just ramping things back up and endangering the lives of thousands of people"". He added that there had been ""a little bit of tension"" between Mr Trump and state governors over when to re-open businesses, ""but ultimately it is going to be the governors that have to make these decisions"". More than 20 million people in the UShave filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits. Meanwhile, retail sales dropped by 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since tracking began in 1992, according to government data released on Wednesday. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The unexpected items deemed ""essential"" The governors of Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania each issued orders or guidelines that residents should wear face masks as they venture into society in the coming weeks. ""We are going to be getting back to normal - it will be a new normal,"" Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said large gatherings such as sports events and concerts would probably not be allowed in the city until 2021.

Local pharmacies face cash crisis,"""The last month has been the hardest of my 35 years in pharmacy,"" said Dai Williams. He runs two pharmacies in Rhondda in South Wales and while demand has increased massively since the lockdown, that's not been good for business. That's because the wholesale price of medicine has shot up, cutting margins and putting financial pressures on. Meanwhile, longer hours and twice as many deliveries have meant higher staff costs. Thousands of independent community pharmacies across the country are facing a cash crunch. The net result could be closures, leaving communities around the country with no local chemists. Working life for pharmacists has change considerably since the lockdown, said Dai Williams. ""Many of my colleagues have had to shut for a couple of hours during the day just to cope with the extra demands,"" he reported. Asthma patient's mum 'scared' by inhaler shortage Patients urged not to stockpile prescription drugs The biggest issue has been a sharp rise in demand for prescriptions. Making up the medicine is already time-consuming, but currently takes longer because staff are wearing protective equipment. Social-distancing has also had an effect. ""I have a member of staff going round to doctors surgeries to pick up repeat prescriptions, return to the pharmacy to dispense them, and then deliver them to vulnerable members of the community,"" said Mr Williams. The number of deliveries has doubled since the lockdown from 40 to 80 a day. ""We have to cope with the extra work and stress, it's simply what we have to do,"" he said. ""But it's been tough,"" he admitted. Pharmacies aren't cashing in from the extra business as many supply prescriptions at a loss. That's because the NHS drugs tariff, which pharmacies receive for selling generic prescription drugs, is often lower than the prices suppliers demand. Pharmacist Mark Burdon sales wholesale drugs prices have risen That raises the prospect of heavy losses, especially for the majority of community pharmacies that make around 95% of their income from the NHS. ""Suppliers have increased prices since the lockdown,"" said Mark Burdon, who operates five independent pharmacies in Tyne and Wear. ""The price of paracetamol wholesale climbed from around 50p to Â£2,"" he said. The ramp in the price of hydroxychloroquine - the malaria drug mentioned by Donald Trump as a possible Covid-19 cure - was even more dramatic. ""It used to cost us Â£2. Now it costs up to Â£32.49,"" Mr Burdon said. The surge in demand and higher prices has left Mr Burdon's  practices facing a drugs bill more than 50% higher in March than the previous month, which creates its own problems. ""We are effectively paid a couple of months in arrears by the NHS, and we have to pay suppliers before we get the money back,"" he explained. ""Pharmacies are geared up for that but not these sudden extra charges, which could cause huge cashflow problems for some."" Mr Burdon is one of the regional representatives of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. He reckons the government should earmark emergency cash to help pharmacies stay afloat. ""The case has been proven for investment in the community pharmacy service as the front door to the NHS, supporting self-care and keeping people away from their GP or the hospital,"" Mr Burdon said. Meanwhile workers at pharmacies have reported a rise in aggressive behaviour from frustrated customers, with some reportedly even being forced to hire security guards. Problems became so severe in one area that they launch a local campaign urging patients to respect pharmacy staff. ""We were getting calls that staff were getting abuse from a small number of patients, such as banging on windows and shouting, with one member of staff even reporting being spat at,"" said Kath Gulson, chief officer of Community Pharmacy Lancashire. ""Problems began with the surge in prescriptions at a time when we faced reduced staff because some were forced to self-isolate.`' With pharmacies shutting at times to catch up with prescriptions, plus restrictions placed on the amount of over-the-counter drugs that could be bought, some customers got very angry, she said. They launched the ""Care for your pharmacy so your pharmacy can care for you"" campaign. ""We're just asking customers to understand the different way we have to operate now and support us so we can support the people that need us.""

IMF head calls for Brexit trade talk extension,"The IMF has suggested the UK and the EU should not ""add to uncertainty"" from coronavirus by refusing to extend the period to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal. Managing director Kristalina Georgieva, when asked what she thought about the prospect of no trade deal this year and no extension to talks, told the BBC that because of the ""unprecedented uncertainty"" arising from the pandemic, it would be ""wise not to add more on top of it"". ""I really hope that all policymakers everywhere would be thinking about [reducing uncertainty]. It is tough as it is, let's not make it any tougher,"" she said. Asked specifically if she would advise an extension to trade talks, Ms Georgieva said: ""My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, the UK, the EU, and the whole world."" The IMF chief had expressed her backing for the deal struck by Boris Johnson's team last autumn, having warned  then that a no-deal Brexit would hit the UK economy by up to 5%. 'World faces worst recession since Great Depression' IMF provides $50bn to fight coronavirus outbreak A visual guide to the economic impact of coronavirus The UK government chose to put into law a refusal to trigger provisions to extend the Brexit implementation phase beyond the end of the year. That means that without a deal, the UK and EU would trade on World Trade Organization terms, including significant new taxes and checks on trade, from the beginning of next year. Number 10 says that remains the position. Yesterday, both the UK and EU announced a curtailed timetable to carry out three negotiation rounds by video conference. Ms Georgieva says she is now preoccupied with trying to find ways to help alleviate ""a global recession we have not seen in our lifetimes"", arising out of the pandemic.

'Profound' impact predicted on mental health,"The coronavirus pandemic could have a ""profound"" effect on people's mental health - now and in the future, say psychiatrists and psychologists who are calling for urgent research. Writing in The Lancet Psychiatry,external, they say smartphones should be used to monitor mental health in real time. And support would need to be tailored to specific groups, such as children and front-line health workers. Surveys suggest,externalanxiety and isolation are already affecting the public. Mental health charity Mind said people were already struggling to access the support they needed. Twenty-four leading mental-health experts want widespread ""moment-to-moment"" monitoring of the mental health of the population so that effective tools and support can be designed quickly to help people at home. ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing,"" said Prof Rory O'Connor, one of the paper's authors, from the University of Glasgow. He said doing nothing would risk a rise in conditions such as anxiety and depression, and more people turning to alcohol, drugs and gambling, as well as other consequences, such as homelessness. The paper's authors said the priorities were to monitor rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental-health issues. Kate King has found ways to cope with low-level anxiety Kate King, 57, who has depression, says these are particularly difficult times for people with mental-health conditions. ""Anxiety is a natural response to the situation we are in - I have low-level anxiety all the time. ""You can have waves of it - watching news coverage, thinking about your health and other people..."" But Kate has learnt ways to cope, centring on living for the day - and playing her melodeon (a squeeze box). ""It works for me,"" she says. ""I can't go out for coffee so I sit down with people online, or my two daughters, and have one every morning. ""I try to enjoy what I do minute to minute. ""Just going and putting the washing on is something that doesn't leave you room for worrying around the edges."" Going out for a walk, however, can feel stressful if there are too many people to avoid - and can make things worse, she says. Two online surveys, run by the Academy of Medical Sciences and carried out in late March, present a snapshot of the current state of people's mental health. One by UK charity MQ, covering more than 2,100 people, including many with mental-health conditions, highlighted their concerns about accessing support and services during the pandemic, as well as the fear that their existing health problems might get worse. Another, of 1,099 members of the public, revealed worries about the effects of social isolation and financial difficulties created by the response to the crisis. While a rise in anxiety and stress is expected during the pandemic, the paper says there is a risk that the numbers of people with depression and those self-harming or taking their own lives will increase. During the Sars epidemic of 2003, for example, there was a 30% increase in suicide in the over-65s, the paper says. It added that the policies used to manage the pandemic would ""inevitably have serious effects on mental health by increasing unemployment, financial insecurity and poverty"". The paper lists eight groups that might experience the pandemic differently from the general population: children, young people and families (school closures, domestic violence, no free school meals) older adults and those with underlying health issues (isolation, loneliness, bereavement) people with existing mental-health issues (disruption to services and relapses) front-line healthcare workers (fears of contamination, work stress) people with learning difficulties (changes to routines and support) people on low incomes (job and financial insecurity) prisoners, the homeless and refugees (social exclusion) society in general might experience increased health inequality and a rise in use of food banks ""While it is too soon to see the extent of the damage, we are hearing that people are already struggling to access the support they need,"" says Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. He said people were being discharged from NHS mental-health services, and referrals to children's and adolescent mental-health services and psychological therapies had dropped. ""Government and services need to understand not only how to support people properly now, but also what the long-term impact is likely to be and the services that will need to be put in place to help people rebuild their lives."" Mr Farmer said the longer people went without treatment and support, the more unwell they would become. ""The ultimate consequence of this is a rise in self-harm and suicides."" According to people surveyed: staying connected with friends and family, often online keeping busy with hobbies, crafts, reading, films and home improvements physical activity, such as walking, running and exercise classes staying calm, thanks to mindfulness, meditation, prayer or pets information intake - managing access to news and social media maintaining routine by having a daily plan The experts behind the paper,externalsay almost nothing is known about the effect of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on the human nervous system. But since other coronaviruses have been shown to pass into the central nervous system, the paper recommends more research on the effects of Covid-19 in those areas. Symptoms linked to the brain in people with the infection have been reported, including headaches, dizziness, loss of smell and taste, muscle pain and weakness, among others. The researchers say a database should be set up to monitor any psychological or brain effects of Covid-19.

A truer picture on fatalities linked to Covid-19 shows that more than 1,000 people have died in Scotland Scotlandâs Championship, League 1 and League 2 football season has come to an end with a majority vote by its members BBC Scotland News Here's a summary of some of Thursday's developments:  We'll be back with live coverage of the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland on Friday morning.     The first minister told Reporting Scotland the coming weeks will involve striking ""a better balance"" than the current lockdown measures. That will inevitably mean using testing, tracing, surveillance, isolating people as well as, perhaps, some continuation of social distancing measures. But we do understand that while these lockdown measures are essential right now, and they are absolutely essential, they have consequences of their own that we have to be mindful of, to the economy and to well being more generally. These are horrendously difficult balances to strike. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dundee, who have been at the centre of the SPFL vote saga, insist their delayed approval has delivered the ""best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed"". The Championship club's intended 'no' vote failed to arrive in time for Friday's suggested deadline, leaving them with the decisive say in the motion to call an end to their division as well as League One and League Two. A 'yes' vote was cast yesterday, making it 35 out of 42 clubs in favour of the measures proposed to help deal with the coronavirus crisis. Dundee say they submitted their vote and issued yesterday's statement ""simultaneously"", adding: ""There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels."" With talks on league reconstruction beginning soon, the latest statement from Dens Park concludes: ""From a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was asked on BBCReporting Scotlandif we can expect the lockdown to last longer than the additional three weeks? The advice is clear. If we lift these restrictions now or too early we risk a resurgence of the virus and a potentially damaging and exponential increase in cases that would cost more lives and potentially overwhelm the NHS. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister All residents in Orkney's
outer isles are being offered Â£5 per week to help out with the cost of food. Travel restrictions mean that
almost three thousand people do not have regular ferry or plane access to reach supermarkets on the Orkney mainland, with shopping in rural shops often more expensive. The money will come from the Scottish government's Â£30n Food Fund at an estimated cost of Â£58,000 for an initial four-week period. Orkney Islands Council has an allocation of Â£99,000, with the remainder to be spent supporting families of children who are eligible for free school meals. Tributes have been paid to a former firefighter who has lost his life to coronavirus. Derek Wilkie had been receiving care an intensive care unit at Raigmore Hospital when he died on Sunday. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said he was a ""larger than life personality"". Mr Wilkie's wife, Janice, is a cancer nurse and his sons work in the health service, one as a paramedic and the other at a medical lab at Raigmore. Read morehere.

""This virus is not just going to disappear,"" warns Nicola Sturgeon as she looks ahead to future developments like a vaccine and antibody testing. She applauds the people of Scotland for sticking with the rules and adds that we will get through these difficult times if we stick together. But for the ""foreseeable future"" there will be ""some kind of restriction on our normal way of life"". She gives a broad outline for the future, emphasising the importance of testing and tracing as our understanding of Covid-19 improves and said the Scottish Government would set out more detail about easing the measures in the ""coming days"". ""We don't have all of the answers but we are developing a plan to plot the best way forward,"" she says. The first minister repeats the list of restrictions and says that they cannot be lifted for at least three weeks because all of the progress made would be lost. ""This is a risk we simply cannot take,"" Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we were to lift any of these measures now, we would risk an immediate and potentially exponential resurgence of the virus. And that could result in our NHS being quickly overwhelmed. ""It could result in even more cases in our care homes, and it would also mean much more loss of life. ""It could of course also lead to the reintroduction of even more stringent restrictions in the future and substantially more damage to the economy."" On the extension of the lockdown measures across the UK, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that the early indications are that restrictions have led to a slow down in community transmission. ""The difficult sacrifices you are all making are working,"" she says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms that the current lockdown arrangements must remain in place for another three weeks at least. The foreign secretary says the current lockdown measures will continue for at least three more weeks. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about when the public can see the end of this, Dominic Raab refers to comments made by the prime minister at the beginning of the outbreak, saying this stage should last for three months. ""That is broadly still the outline [and] it will be reviewed at the end of the month,"" he says. But he adds it would be ""irresponsible"" to give a definitive timeframe and could ""prejudice the evidence"" being collected by scientific advisers. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel, there is progress, and we must keep up."" Asked why he won't reveal plans for an exit strategy from social distancing measures, he again says it may prejudice the evidence. ""We have got to keep this up,"" says the foreign secretary. ""What you are doing is working, notwithstanding the death toll - tragic for so many people. ""But if we let up now, it will be damaging for public health and the economy."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor on Drivetime It was very emotive stuff from Dominic Raab. I was really struck by his talk of damage not just to public health but to public health and the economy. He was saying if we don't have the proper constraints then the virus can come roaring back and that will ruin not just the gains in public health but also wreck the economy further  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will give a statement on the extension to coronavirus lockdown measures in Scotland. Her briefing will start soon after 17.30 and will be carried live here. The foreign secretary says he understands people have been comparing the UK's actions with other countries, but the government will ""make decisions at the right time"" for us. He continues: ""I appreciate the impact is considerable on people and businesses across the country. ""We get it, we know it is rough going. Every time I come to this lectern and read out the grim toll, I walk away and think of their sons and daughters going through this right now, their brothers, sisters, grandchildren, all those left behind. ""It makes this government focus even harder on what we must do and I know together, united, we must keep up this national effort."" Dominic Raab says he wants to be ""up front with British people"" about when the government can relax measures. He lists five points that will influence the government's decision: Dominic Raab says there have been indications that social distancing measures in place are showing success. But government advisers say the evidence is ""mixed and inconsistent"", and in some settings infections are increasing. He adds: ""We still don't have infection rates down as much as we need to. ""Any change to social distancing measures now would risk significant increase in infections,"" he says, as well as a second peak and an increase in the number of deaths. As a result, the government will keep the current measures in place for three more weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

Some social distancing needed 'until vaccine found',"The UK must keep a ""significant level"" of social distancing until a vaccine for coronavirus is found, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC there was ""little leeway"" to relax measures without ""something... in their place"" - such as testing and contact tracing. A three-week extension to the lockdownis expected to be announced later. It comes as the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 13,729. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducedstrict curbs on life in the UK,externalon 23 March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The government - led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as Mr Johnson continues to recover from the virus - will detail the outcome of the first assessment at the daily news conference later. Labour said it would support an extension, but called for details on how and when the lockdown will end. Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic' Medics to trial 'glimmer of hope' blood treatment Are we getting closer to a coronavirus vaccine? When am I allowed to go out? Meanwhile, more than nine in 10 people dying with coronavirus have an underlying health condition,analysis by the Office for National Statistics has found. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said easing the lockdown after another three weeks would depend on ""how quickly case numbers go down"". He said that required ""a single-minded emphasis"" in government and the health system on ""scaling up testing and putting in place the ability to track down cases in the community and contact trace"". Contact tracing aims to identify and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with the virus. The government has announced plans for a contact-tracing app,but experts say 80% of smartphone owners must sign upfor it to halt the outbreak. Without scaled-up testing and contact tracing, Prof Ferguson said estimates showed ""we have relatively little leeway"". The UK now has the capacity to carry out 35,000 tests for coronavirus a day, Downing Street said, although latest figures showed that fewer than half that number were carried out. The prime minister's official spokesperson said this was due to a ""lack of demand, not a lack of capacity"" and the government was expanding eligibility. On relaxing the current restrictions, Prof Ferguson said: ""What we really need is the ability to put something in their place. If we want to open schools, let people get back to work, then we need to keep transmission down in another manner. ""And I should say, it's not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some level of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available."" BBC health correspondent James Gallagher saidif a vaccine were to be found, it was not expected that manufacturers would be able to mass produce it until the second half of 2021. ""Remember, there are four coronaviruses that already circulate in human beings. They cause the common cold, and we don't have vaccines for any of them,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health Prof Ferguson said he believed the ""daily number of infections peaked two weeks ago"", but said it was ""too early to relax"". Asked whether the government is moving towards having a lockdown exit strategy in place, Prof Ferguson said he would like to see ""action accelerated"" and called for more infrastructure. ""I'm reminded by the fact we had a Department for Brexit for government - that was a major national emergency, as it were - and we're faced with something which is, at the moment, even larger than Brexit and yet I don't see quite the same evidence for that level of organisation,"" he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Today that Prof Ferguson was not seeing such action behind the scenes in government ""because he advises government, he's not in the government"". He said that ministers would ""not be distracted"" into confusing its ""core"" message to stay at home and protect the NHS. ""How we communicate as a government has a direct impact on the amount of cases that we have and therefore the amount of people who die,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We talk about what is needed now and when we need to change that we will."" Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Breakfast he believed the government had been clear ""we think it too early to make a change"". Mr Hancock said he did not want to put the ""good effort"" of the public to waste by ending the lockdown too early, adding that releasing all measures now would let the virus ""run rampant"". All the indications are that the UK is hitting the peak of coronavirus cases. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus seems to be levelling out. There are more than 10,000 beds on general wards available and another 2,000 spaces in intensive care. It is this headroom that prompted NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, to declare this week thatit was ""increasingly"" confident the health service could cope. But the government's advisers will no doubt be advising ministers that the lockdown should continue - because they fear any lifting of restrictions at this stage could undo the good work, and see a spike in cases that would gobble up that spare capacity and overwhelm the health service. The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, warned of a possible ""bounce"" in the numbers soon, due to delays in reporting deaths over the Easter weekend. Another 740 people have died in English hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus. In Scotland, a further 80 people died and Northern Ireland recorded a further 18 deaths. In Wales, there were another 32 deaths. The UK-wide figures use a different timeframe to individual nations. Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Breakfast that Labour would back an extension. But he called for clarity from the government about ""what happens next"" and for a move to a ""testing and contact-tracing strategy"" to exit the lockdown.

The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned of a possible ""bounce"" in the numbers soon, due to delays in reporting deaths over the Easter weekend. He said while the UK was ""probably"" reaching the peak of its epidemic, the high numbers of deaths were expected to continue for a ""short while"" longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducedstrict curbs on life in the UK,externalon 23 March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, people have been allowed to leave home only to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil medical or care needs. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The government - led by Mr Raab as Mr Johnson continues to recover from the virus - will detail the outcome of the first assessment at the daily Downing Street news conference later. All the indications are that the UK is hitting the peak of coronavirus cases. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus seems to be levelling out. There are more than 10,000 beds on general wards available and another 2,000 spaces in intensive care - and that's before you count the capacity available at the Nightingale hospitals.

He said: ""Last night the junior health minister Nadine Dorries was complaining on Twitter that people shouldn't be asking about an exit strategy because there's no exit strategy until we get a vaccine.

It described more recent deliveries as ""haphazard"". The group said mixed messages from the government had created ""confusion and additional workload"", as the care sector struggled to cope with the virus. The leak came to light afterthe health secretary launched a new supply network, including an emergency 24/7 helpline, to help get PPE to care home staff. Care providers have been calling for more testing and PPE for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock displays a new ""badge of honour"" designed to recognise the work of carers The Department of Health's statistics have come in for scrutiny in recent days. They do not include deaths in care homes - leading charities to claim the government was ""airbrushing"" the death toll. In Scotland, new figures suggesta quarter of deaths linked to coronavirus have occurred in care homes. In England and Wales there were217 deaths in care homes by 3 April. That number is known to now be much higher. And 24 residentsdied after an outbreak at one care home in Staffordshire. As part of new government guidelines, Mr Hancock announced on Wednesday that family members of dying relatives would be allowed to visit them to say their goodbyes ""wherever possible"". He also promised anyone moving from hospital into social care would be tested for the virus to prevent care home outbreaks. However, critics have questioned the logistics of isolating people as they await test results. Labour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, said few care home staff had been tested so far. In response to Mr Hancock unveiling what he called a ""badge of honour"" to recognise care workers, she told the BBC: ""I think probably what they want more than a brand or a badge is protective equipment, proper testing and a decent salary.""

Virus protection for care workers 'shambolic'A leaked letter reveals an extensive list of concerns about how the social care sector is coping.UK Politics,"A leaked letter seen by the BBC has revealed an extensive list of concerns about how the social care sector is coping with the coronavirus crisis. The letter raises fears about funding, testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the shielding scheme for vulnerable people. Written on Saturday, to a senior official at the Department of Health and Social Care by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), it says mixed messages from the government have created ""confusion and additional workload"". On protective equipment for care workers, the letter says the national handling has been ""shambolic"". Early drops of equipment have been ""paltry"" and more recent deliveries have been ""haphazard"", with some even being confiscated by border control for the NHS. The letter says there have been contradictory messages from the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department of Health on theshielding schemefor people particularly at risk from the illness. And while the rollout of testing for care workers has been generally welcomed, the letter states ""testing for care workers appears to be being rolled out without being given thought to who is going to be tested and what we are going to do with the result"". Adass is a charity that supports members from all 151 local authorities in England with responsibility for adult social care. Virus tests promised for care homes Close family to be allowed coronavirus goodbyes 'Less than half' of council's PPE order delivered The organisation is also critical of the way central government has recruited volunteers, saying the national scheme has ""diverted 750,000 volunteers away from supporting local communities and left them with nothing to do for the first three weeks"", and claiming it was ""shameful that this was not done in collaboration with local government"". While the letter, alsoreported in the Local Government Chronicle,external, welcomes some of the guidance given by Whitehall, it raises significant concerns about the interaction between central government and local government. It suggests the sector had to make ""invidious decisions before the pandemic"" and now is not being given the same consideration as the NHS. ""We are very concerned that there is a significant imbalance between listening, hearing, and understanding NHS England as opposed to social care,"" it says. The social care system helps and looks after older and disabled people in residential centres and in their own homes. There are more than 400,000 residents in care homes in 15,000 locations in England. Adass has broadly welcomed thehealth secretary's plan to help social care, which was announced on Wednesday. Matt Hancock announced that all care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for coronavirus, as well as any new care home residents being discharged from hospital into care. But senior figures in the care sector say there is scepticism about whether the commitments can be delivered. Responding to Mr Hancock's announcements, Adass said: ""We now have a national strategy; the challenge is now to implement it. Any strategy will ultimately be judged by actions it produces, not words it contains."" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said: ""It's absolutely true that we need to do more - that's why we put the next stages of our action plan out... so we can test all people going from hospital into care homes."" He said that 15% of care homes in the UK have two or more cases of Covid-19. When challenged on that figure - one care home boss, for example, says two thirds of his homes are infected - Mr Hancock said it was a ""robust figure"". He told BBC Breakfast that ""what really matters is availability of testing now in social care"" where he said more than 10,000 tests of residents had been undertaken. Mr Hancock also said his latest figures showed 1,500 care workers were tested on Tuesday, while 4,100 workers have the test ""immediately available to them"". A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the government's plan in England included ""ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes and helping to minimise the spread of the virus to keep people safe"". ""We will continue to work closely with the social care sector to ensure they have everything they need to respond to this outbreak and receive the recognition they deserve,"" they added. The government has also said it is ""committed to ensuring that all areas have access to PPE"" and is ""working round the clock"" with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure supply. It said 38 million items of PPE had been delivered to local resilience forums - multi-agency groups of emergency services and agencies - since last week. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the concerns raised in the letter were ""extremely worrying"". ""Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn't been properly thought through must be an urgent wake up call for ministers,"" she added. ""Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary to halt the emerging crisis in social care.""

Ministers to back three-week lockdown extensionLabour says it will support an extension but calls for details on how and when the lockdown will end.,"Ministers are later expected to announce a three-week extension to the coronavirus lockdown. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will lead emergency Cobra committee and cabinet meetings about the continuation of social distancing measures. Labour has said it will support an extension, but also called for details on how and when the lockdown would end. Meanwhile, social care directors have saiddistribution of protective kit for carers has been ""shambolic"". There have been 27 verified deaths with coronavirus among NHS staff, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed. On extending the lockdown, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast he believed the government had been clear ""we think it too early to make a change"". He said: ""We can see that we're reaching a peak, that is good news, but we can see that the numbers are not yet coming down, therefore we can't make a change."" Mr Hancock added that he did not want to put the ""good effort"" of the public to waste by ending the lockdown too early. ""If we just released all the measures now then this virus would run rampant,"" he said. The health secretary is due to meet the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales later ahead of making a formal decision on the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health During Wednesday's daily press briefing, Mr Hancock said restrictions on movement were beginning to help reduce the spread of the virus. The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned of a possible ""bounce"" in the numbers soon, due to delays in reporting deaths over the Easter weekend. He said while the UK was ""probably"" reaching the peak of its epidemic, the high numbers of deaths were expected to continue for a ""short while"" longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducedstrict curbs on life in the UK,externalon 23 March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, people have been allowed to leave home only to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil medical or care needs. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The government - led by Mr Raab as Mr Johnson continues to recover from the virus - will detail the outcome of the first assessment at the daily Downing Street news conference later. All the indications are that the UK is hitting the peak of coronavirus cases. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus seems to be levelling out. There are more than 10,000 beds on general wards available and another 2,000 spaces in intensive care - and that's before you count the capacity available at the Nightingale hospitals. It is this headroom that prompted NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, to declare this week thatit was ""increasingly"" confident the health service could cope. But the government's advisers will be advising ministers that the lockdown should continue. They fear any lifting of restrictions at this stage could undo the good work, and see a spike in cases that would gobble up that spare capacity and overwhelm the health service. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Breakfast he expected the lockdown to be extended for a further three weeks, and that the party would back an extension. But he called for clarity from the government about ""what happens next"" and for a move to a ""testing and contact-tracing strategy"" to exit the lockdown. He said: ""Last night the junior health minister Nadine Dorries was complaining on Twitter that people shouldn't be asking about an exit strategy because there's no exit strategy until we get a vaccine. ""Well that could be 18 months away so if the government are saying we're in lockdown for 18 months they probably need to tell us."" Allow Twitter content?

Ministers inScotlandandWaleshave already said their lockdowns are set to remain in place, while Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster confirmedthe NI lockdown will be extended until 9 May. According to the latest figures, 12,868 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for the virus in the UK, a day-on-day increase of 761.

It described more recent deliveries as ""haphazard"". The group said mixed messages from the government had created ""confusion and additional workload"", as the care sector struggled to cope with the virus. The leak came to light afterthe health secretary launched a new supply network, including an emergency 24/7 helpline, to help get PPE to care home staff. Care providers have been calling for more testing and PPE for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock displays a new ""badge of honour"" designed to recognise the work of carers The Department of Health's statistics have come in for scrutiny in recent days. They do not include deaths in care homes - leading charities to claim the government was ""airbrushing"" the death toll. In Scotland, new figures suggesta quarter of deaths linked to coronavirus have occurred in care homes. In England and Wales there were217 deaths in care homes by 3 April. That number is known to now be much higher. And 24 residentsdied after an outbreak at one care home in Staffordshire. As part of new government guidelines, Mr Hancock announced on Wednesday that family members of dying relatives would be allowed to visit them to say their goodbyes ""wherever possible"". He also promised anyone moving from hospital into social care would be tested for the virus to prevent care home outbreaks. However, critics have questioned the logistics of isolating people as they await test results. Labour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, said few care home staff had been tested so far. In response to Mr Hancock unveiling what he called a ""badge of honour"" to recognise care workers, she told the BBC: ""I think probably what they want more than a brand or a badge is protective equipment, proper testing and a decent salary.""

This was the team behind Thursday's live coverage: Vicky Bissett, Francis Keogh, Mary OâConnor, Joel Gunter, Michael Emons, Kevin Ponniah, Owen Amos, Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Tessa Wong, Sophie Williams, Matthew Henry, Paul Seddon, Jennifer Scott, Max Matza, Jessica Murphy, Doug Faulkner, Rebecca Seales, Lucy Webster, Alix Kroeger, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin.  We're now wrapping up our live page for the evening. Thanks for tuning in. Here's a round-up of what's happened around the world today:  Join us again on Friday, when we'll be bringing you more updates from our teams around the world. ""It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before,"" says Trump of the US economy, as his remarks end. In a veiled dig at China and the World Health Organization, Trump laments that the US government was not sufficiently warned to prepare for the coronavirus. ""I was angry, because it should have been told to us sooner,"" says Trump. ""People should have told us about this. They should've told the rest of the world, too."" Asked if he means China, Trump responds: ""I'm not saying anything."" White House memos show he was first warned of the new virus in January. After moving swiftly to ban travel from China to the US, critics say the Trump administration wasted precious time until mid-March. A reporter asks Trump when he will resume hitting the campaign trail, and he responds: ""I want to make the country better. I donât care about campaigning."" Critics have accused the president of using the White House briefing room as a campaign soap box. His re-election team continues to hold virtual campaign events. Trump says each of the states are different, and make up a ""mosaic"" of readiness to reopen. ""I call it a beautiful puzzle,"" he says of the US map, adding that around 29 states are in good condition to begin reopening soon. On a personal level, he says he knows people who have suffered from the virus. ""I have a number of people who were very great people who were just decimated by what happened,"" he said. He says one person he knows - but does not name - was dead four days after testing positive for Covid-19. Earlier this week the president paid his respects to a New York real estate developer he knew who died with coronavirus. When asked about protesters who have been rallying against lockdown measures from Michigan to North Carolina to Kentucky, President Trump expresses sympathy for them. ""There's death and there's problems in staying at home, too. It's not all 'isn't it wonderful to stay home',"" Trump says. He is asked what his message is for the demonstrators, who are demanding their states reopen. ""They seem to be protesters who like me and express this opinion and my opinion is just about the same as all of the governors,"" he says. He calls on the demonstrators, many of whom carry Trump campaign flags, to heed the guidelines issues by the federal government. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Michigan protesters defy stay-at-home order ""You want to call it the new normal, you can call it whatever want,"" says top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci. ""But it's not game over."" He warns that the virus may rebound, and there could be setbacks along the way. ""It may very well be, as we go this cycle around, that there may be this virus that wants to come back us. ""But I think we can handle it"" until a vaccine is found, he adds. Here are the slides shown at the briefing just now, detailing how the country will be reopening from phase one to three. As states work through the three phases, they may allow for more and more employees to return to work in increments, suggests Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. Phase three, she says, will be the ""new normal"" and will still include suggestions that vulnerable people avoid spending time in crowded spaces. Other people can begin to meet in public, but should still adhere to physcial distancing. Gyms, for instance, can open ""if they adhere to strict social distancing guidelines,"" Dr Birx continues. Dr Deborah Birx Trump has pledged that ""the sacrifices our citizens"" will be ""honoured for generations to come"". He also praised the spirit of bipartisanship that allowed the passage of the massive congressional bailout, and united people across the country. However, it comes hours after he attacked Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Twitter, calling her ""an incompetent, third-rate politician"". In that post, he claimed the California lawmaker had deleted a tweet with a video, taken back in February, where she encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. He claimed that this meant she was ""responsible for many deaths"". However,fact-checkers have found that Trump's claim is untrue,external- because Pelosi never tweeted the video in the first place. The video is a clip from a CBS report on 24 February. San Francisco issued a shelter in place order in mid March. Nancy Pelosi leads the House of Representatives ""We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of glory,"" Trump finishes as he hands over to Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence is now outlining the provisions of the White House plan, called ""Re-Opening Up American Again"". ""Every state is different,"" Trump says, meaning some may open very quickly but others will need more time. He calls on governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do."" He also calls on states to work together with other nearby states to ""harmonise their regional efforts,"" as several have already done. ""We will continue to work with governors to guide them on testing,"" he says. Earlier this week, the president was at loggerheads with state governors about who had the ultimate authority to ease restrictions and reopen businesses. He has since agreed that it is a decision for governors to make, and that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Trump has long been conscious of the impact that the outbreak, and social distancing measures, have had on the US economy. At the briefing, he stresses: ""We're opening up our country... America wants to be open."" ""We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly and that's what's going to happen."" ""We closed our economy in order to win this war. And we are winning it now,"" he adds. Individual states will re-open on different schedules, he adds. More than 20 million people in the US have filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits.  Trump says Americans all over have ""joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt this disease"". He says mitigation efforts prevented worst-case scenarios from coming true. ""It's looking like we will come far under,"" projected death toll figures, he continues. He adds that one death is too many, but overall ""the peak is behind us"". ""A sustained shutdown is not a long term solution,"" he says, before outlining the plan for getting American re-opened. President Trump has begun speaking and is expected to announce his plan for when and how governors should lift lockdown orders in their states. He is joined in the briefing room by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. You can watch it livehere. Trump is now addressing reporters from the White House about his plan to re-start the American economy. We'll bring you more updates shortly. President Trump will announce plans to re-open the US in his briefing - but many US media outlets have already obtained a copy of the new guidelines. TheâOpening Up America Again"" plan,externalincludes three 14-day phases that states should consider implementing as they allow schools and businesses to re-open. The first phase calls for social-distancing measures and for schools and businesses to be shut. If states see a steady decline in cases, they can move to phase two, in which some businesses can open but in a diminished capacity and groups of up to 50 may gather. The third phase calls for workers to fully return to business, and for some at-risk people to continue to take precautions. Visits to hospitals and elderly care homes can begin under phase three. Some large gatherings could begin again as early as 1 May, according to Trump's plan. In a call with state governors earlier today, Trump walked back his earlier claim that he had ""absolute"" power to dictate when states should re-open. Instead, he told governors: ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you. We're going to be supplying you as needed, if you need something that you don't have."" ""You're going to call your own shots,"" Trump added on the call, according to a recording obtained by CBS News. ""We'll be standing right alongside of you and we're going to get our country open and get it working and our people want to get working.""  We're expecting a White House press briefing shortly, where President Donald Trump is expected to give guidelines on reopening the US economy. In the meantime, here's a quick recap of how the outbreak unfolded in the country. 21 January 2020:The first case is reported in the US. The patient is a man in Washington state who had returned from Wuhan. In the days that follow, cases are reported in Illinois, California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, all thought to be related to visits to China 29 January:The government announces a coronavirus task force to handle the outbreak 31 January:The US suspends entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past 14 days. It does not include immediate relatives of American nationals and permanent residents 24 February:President Trump asks Congress for $1.25 billion (Â£1 billion) for the country's response to the virus. 26 February:The US reports its first case of suspected local transmission. 29 February:The first coronavirus death is announced in the country. The government issues ""do not travel"" warnings for countries including China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. 13 March:President Trump declares a national emergency. 17 March:The death toll in the US rises to 100. The deaths were reported in 18 states. 19 March:California becomes first state to order residents to stay at home. 20 March:New York state follows suit, issuing its own stay-at-home order. 22 March:The US records 32,000 cases and at least 400 deaths. 26 March:US confirms 81,321 infections, making it the country with the most confirmed cases. 12 April:The US confirms more than 20,000 deaths. 16 April:President Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases. So far the country has reported over 650,000 cases and over 32,000 deaths. Luiz Henrique Mandetta tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro had handed him his notice Brazil's health minister has been fired by the country's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been at odds for weeks over their differing views on tackling the virus. President Bolsonaro had publicly criticised Luiz Henrique Mandetta for urging people to observe social distancing and stay indoors. The Brazilian leader disagreed with these measures, instead downplaying the virus as ""a little flu"". A total of 1,924 people have died with Covid-19 in Brazil, while the country has had 30,425 confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. However, Brazil tests just under 300 people for every million inhabitants and one group of Brazilian researchers saysthere could be as many as 313,000 cases in Brazil,external. The situation is difficult at Vila Formosa in Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest cemetery,where workers say they bury about 40 people per day. Â© 2025 BBC.

""But it's not game over."" He warns that the virus may rebound, and there could be setbacks along the way. ""It may very well be, as we go this cycle around, that there may be this virus that wants to come back us. ""But I think we can handle it"" until a vaccine is found, he adds. Here are the slides shown at the briefing just now, detailing how the country will be reopening from phase one to three. As states work through the three phases, they may allow for more and more employees to return to work in increments, suggests Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. Phase three, she says, will be the ""new normal"" and will still include suggestions that vulnerable people avoid spending time in crowded spaces. Other people can begin to meet in public, but should still adhere to physcial distancing. Gyms, for instance, can open ""if they adhere to strict social distancing guidelines,"" Dr Birx continues. Dr Deborah Birx Trump has pledged that ""the sacrifices our citizens"" will be ""honoured for generations to come"". He also praised the spirit of bipartisanship that allowed the passage of the massive congressional bailout, and united people across the country. However, it comes hours after he attacked Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Twitter, calling her ""an incompetent, third-rate politician"". In that post, he claimed the California lawmaker had deleted a tweet with a video, taken back in February, where she encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. He claimed that this meant she was ""responsible for many deaths"". However,fact-checkers have found that Trump's claim is untrue,external- because Pelosi never tweeted the video in the first place. The video is a clip from a CBS report on 24 February. San Francisco issued a shelter in place order in mid March. Nancy Pelosi leads the House of Representatives ""We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of glory,"" Trump finishes as he hands over to Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence is now outlining the provisions of the White House plan, called ""Re-Opening Up American Again"". ""Every state is different,"" Trump says, meaning some may open very quickly but others will need more time. He calls on governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do."" He also calls on states to work together with other nearby states to ""harmonise their regional efforts,"" as several have already done. ""We will continue to work with governors to guide them on testing,"" he says. Earlier this week, the president was at loggerheads with state governors about who had the ultimate authority to ease restrictions and reopen businesses. He has since agreed that it is a decision for governors to make, and that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Trump has long been conscious of the impact that the outbreak, and social distancing measures, have had on the US economy. At the briefing, he stresses: ""We're opening up our country... America wants to be open."" ""We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly and that's what's going to happen."" ""We closed our economy in order to win this war. And we are winning it now,"" he adds. Individual states will re-open on different schedules, he adds. More than 20 million people in the US have filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits.  Trump says Americans all over have ""joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt this disease"". He says mitigation efforts prevented worst-case scenarios from coming true. ""It's looking like we will come far under,"" projected death toll figures, he continues. He adds that one death is too many, but overall ""the peak is behind us"". ""A sustained shutdown is not a long term solution,"" he says, before outlining the plan for getting American re-opened. President Trump has begun speaking and is expected to announce his plan for when and how governors should lift lockdown orders in their states. He is joined in the briefing room by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. You can watch it livehere. Trump is now addressing reporters from the White House about his plan to re-start the American economy. We'll bring you more updates shortly. President Trump will announce plans to re-open the US in his briefing - but many US media outlets have already obtained a copy of the new guidelines. TheâOpening Up America Again"" plan,externalincludes three 14-day phases that states should consider implementing as they allow schools and businesses to re-open. The first phase calls for social-distancing measures and for schools and businesses to be shut. If states see a steady decline in cases, they can move to phase two, in which some businesses can open but in a diminished capacity and groups of up to 50 may gather. The third phase calls for workers to fully return to business, and for some at-risk people to continue to take precautions. Visits to hospitals and elderly care homes can begin under phase three. Some large gatherings could begin again as early as 1 May, according to Trump's plan. In a call with state governors earlier today, Trump walked back his earlier claim that he had ""absolute"" power to dictate when states should re-open. Instead, he told governors: ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you. We're going to be supplying you as needed, if you need something that you don't have."" ""You're going to call your own shots,"" Trump added on the call, according to a recording obtained by CBS News. ""We'll be standing right alongside of you and we're going to get our country open and get it working and our people want to get working.""  We're expecting a White House press briefing shortly, where President Donald Trump is expected to give guidelines on reopening the US economy. In the meantime, here's a quick recap of how the outbreak unfolded in the country. 21 January 2020:The first case is reported in the US. The patient is a man in Washington state who had returned from Wuhan. In the days that follow, cases are reported in Illinois, California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, all thought to be related to visits to China 29 January:The government announces a coronavirus task force to handle the outbreak 31 January:The US suspends entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past 14 days. It does not include immediate relatives of American nationals and permanent residents 24 February:President Trump asks Congress for $1.25 billion (Â£1 billion) for the country's response to the virus. 26 February:The US reports its first case of suspected local transmission. 29 February:The first coronavirus death is announced in the country. The government issues ""do not travel"" warnings for countries including China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. 13 March:President Trump declares a national emergency. 17 March:The death toll in the US rises to 100. The deaths were reported in 18 states. 19 March:California becomes first state to order residents to stay at home. 20 March:New York state follows suit, issuing its own stay-at-home order. 22 March:The US records 32,000 cases and at least 400 deaths. 26 March:US confirms 81,321 infections, making it the country with the most confirmed cases. 12 April:The US confirms more than 20,000 deaths. 16 April:President Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases. So far the country has reported over 650,000 cases and over 32,000 deaths. Luiz Henrique Mandetta tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro had handed him his notice Brazil's health minister has been fired by the country's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been at odds for weeks over their differing views on tackling the virus. President Bolsonaro had publicly criticised Luiz Henrique Mandetta for urging people to observe social distancing and stay indoors. The Brazilian leader disagreed with these measures, instead downplaying the virus as ""a little flu"". A total of 1,924 people have died with Covid-19 in Brazil, while the country has had 30,425 confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. However, Brazil tests just under 300 people for every million inhabitants and one group of Brazilian researchers saysthere could be as many as 313,000 cases in Brazil,external. The situation is difficult at Vila Formosa in Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest cemetery,where workers say they bury about 40 people per day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Trump says virus has 'passed the peak' in US""We'll be the comeback kids,"" the president says, predicting some states will reopen this month.","This video can not be played Michigan residents protest against governor's stay-at-home orders President Donald Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases and predicted some states would reopen this month. Mr Trump told the daily White House briefing that new guidelines would be announced on Thursday after he had spoken to governors. ""We'll be the comeback kids, all of us,"" the president said. ""We want to get our country back."" The US has nearly 640,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 30,900 deaths. Mr Trump's comments came afterNew York City reported a rise in virus fatalities to 10,367. The president has been at loggerheads with state governors about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses. He has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Follow live updates on coronavirus Lessons from Japan's second wave of infections The Trump administration had previously pencilled in 1 May as a possible date to reopen the nation, and on Wednesday Mr Trump said some states may be able to reopen earlier than that. However, some health experts and state governors have cautioned against re-opening the economy too soon. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the 1 May date was ""a bit overly optimistic"" for many areas of the country, as a strong testing and tracing system was needed before social distancing measures are lifted. ""The data suggests that nationwide, we have passed the peak of new cases,"" Mr Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. ""Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress."" The co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, Deborah Birx, said there had been a national decline in confirmed new daily cases from the recorded peak in recent days. Asked why the US accounted for such a significant proportion of the global coronavirus death toll of more than 137,000, Mr Trump accused other countries of lying about their mortality rate. ""Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?"" he said, naming China. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China must show ""full transparency"" on coronavirus, during a call with his Beijing counterpart, Yang Jiechi, the Department of State said. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Mr Pompeo has repeatedly accused Beijing of covering up the scale of the outbreak in the early days, which China denies. President Trump said the US was looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, rather than in a market in the city. ""I will tell you more and more we're hearing the story and we'll see,"" Mr Trump said when asked about the claims at his daily briefing. This video can not be played Trump says the US is investigating claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab A Fox News report, attributed to several unnamed sources, suggests that the coronavirus was a naturally occurring pathogen that leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols, infecting an intern, who then transmitted it to her boyfriend. US media have previously reported that the US embassy in Beijing had raised concerns about safety at two laboratories in Wuhan in recent years. On Tuesday,the Washington Post said it had obtained cables,externaldating from 2018 warning that one facility was studying bat coronaviruses and looking at the possibility of human transmission, adding that the laboratory had ""a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians"". One theory is that coronavirus originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province However Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that US intelligence services believed it was more likely that the virus occurred naturally. ""There's a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide variety of media... we've taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,"" he said, adding: ""The weight of evidence seems to indicate natural."" Scientists attempting to trace the source of the outbreak have said that a range of wild animal species could be the host, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses. They have been trying to ascertain if the virus that causes the disease Covid-19 originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. When questioned about the dangers of reopening too soon, Mr Trump said: ""There's also death involved in keeping it closed."" He cited mental health issues, saying suicide hotlines were ""exploding"" as the economy froze. However the governor of Maryland, Republican Larry Hogan, said on Thursday that now ""would be the worst possible time"" to roll back social distancing in his state. ""Everybody wants to get out economy back,"" he told NBC, but he had to ensure ""we're not just ramping things back up and endangering the lives of thousands of people"". He added that there had been ""a little bit of tension"" between Mr Trump and state governors over when to re-open businesses, ""but ultimately it is going to be the governors that have to make these decisions"". More than 20 million people in the UShave filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits. Meanwhile, retail sales dropped by 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since tracking began in 1992, according to government data released on Wednesday. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The unexpected items deemed ""essential"" The governors of Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania each issued orders or guidelines that residents should wear face masks as they venture into society in the coming weeks. ""We are going to be getting back to normal - it will be a new normal,"" Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said large gatherings such as sports events and concerts would probably not be allowed in the city until 2021.

""It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before,"" says Trump of the US economy, as his remarks end. In a veiled dig at China and the World Health Organization, Trump laments that the US government was not sufficiently warned to prepare for the coronavirus. ""I was angry, because it should have been told to us sooner,"" says Trump. ""People should have told us about this. They should've told the rest of the world, too."" Asked if he means China, Trump responds: ""I'm not saying anything."" White House memos show he was first warned of the new virus in January. After moving swiftly to ban travel from China to the US, critics say the Trump administration wasted precious time until mid-March. A reporter asks Trump when he will resume hitting the campaign trail, and he responds: ""I want to make the country better. I donât care about campaigning."" Critics have accused the president of using the White House briefing room as a campaign soap box. His re-election team continues to hold virtual campaign events. Trump says each of the states are different, and make up a ""mosaic"" of readiness to reopen. ""I call it a beautiful puzzle,"" he says of the US map, adding that around 29 states are in good condition to begin reopening soon. On a personal level, he says he knows people who have suffered from the virus. ""I have a number of people who were very great people who were just decimated by what happened,"" he said. He says one person he knows - but does not name - was dead four days after testing positive for Covid-19. Earlier this week the president paid his respects to a New York real estate developer he knew who died with coronavirus. When asked about protesters who have been rallying against lockdown measures from Michigan to North Carolina to Kentucky, President Trump expresses sympathy for them. ""There's death and there's problems in staying at home, too. It's not all 'isn't it wonderful to stay home',"" Trump says.

In that post, he claimed the California lawmaker had deleted a tweet with a video, taken back in February, where she encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. He claimed that this meant she was ""responsible for many deaths"". However,fact-checkers have found that Trump's claim is untrue,external- because Pelosi never tweeted the video in the first place. The video is a clip from a CBS report on 24 February. San Francisco issued a shelter in place order in mid March. Nancy Pelosi leads the House of Representatives ""We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of glory,"" Trump finishes as he hands over to Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence is now outlining the provisions of the White House plan, called ""Re-Opening Up American Again"". ""Every state is different,"" Trump says, meaning some may open very quickly but others will need more time. He calls on governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do."" He also calls on states to work together with other nearby states to ""harmonise their regional efforts,"" as several have already done. ""We will continue to work with governors to guide them on testing,"" he says. Earlier this week, the president was at loggerheads with state governors about who had the ultimate authority to ease restrictions and reopen businesses. He has since agreed that it is a decision for governors to make, and that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Trump has long been conscious of the impact that the outbreak, and social distancing measures, have had on the US economy. At the briefing, he stresses: ""We're opening up our country... America wants to be open."" ""We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly and that's what's going to happen."" ""We closed our economy in order to win this war. And we are winning it now,"" he adds. Individual states will re-open on different schedules, he adds. More than 20 million people in the US have filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits.  Trump says Americans all over have ""joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt this disease"". He says mitigation efforts prevented worst-case scenarios from coming true. ""It's looking like we will come far under,"" projected death toll figures, he continues. He adds that one death is too many, but overall ""the peak is behind us"". ""A sustained shutdown is not a long term solution,"" he says, before outlining the plan for getting American re-opened. President Trump has begun speaking and is expected to announce his plan for when and how governors should lift lockdown orders in their states. He is joined in the briefing room by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. You can watch it livehere. Trump is now addressing reporters from the White House about his plan to re-start the American economy. We'll bring you more updates shortly. President Trump will announce plans to re-open the US in his briefing - but many US media outlets have already obtained a copy of the new guidelines. TheâOpening Up America Again"" plan,externalincludes three 14-day phases that states should consider implementing as they allow schools and businesses to re-open. The first phase calls for social-distancing measures and for schools and businesses to be shut. If states see a steady decline in cases, they can move to phase two, in which some businesses can open but in a diminished capacity and groups of up to 50 may gather. The third phase calls for workers to fully return to business, and for some at-risk people to continue to take precautions. Visits to hospitals and elderly care homes can begin under phase three. Some large gatherings could begin again as early as 1 May, according to Trump's plan. In a call with state governors earlier today, Trump walked back his earlier claim that he had ""absolute"" power to dictate when states should re-open. Instead, he told governors: ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you. We're going to be supplying you as needed, if you need something that you don't have."" ""You're going to call your own shots,"" Trump added on the call, according to a recording obtained by CBS News. ""We'll be standing right alongside of you and we're going to get our country open and get it working and our people want to get working.""  We're expecting a White House press briefing shortly, where President Donald Trump is expected to give guidelines on reopening the US economy. In the meantime, here's a quick recap of how the outbreak unfolded in the country. 21 January 2020:The first case is reported in the US. The patient is a man in Washington state who had returned from Wuhan. In the days that follow, cases are reported in Illinois, California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, all thought to be related to visits to China 29 January:The government announces a coronavirus task force to handle the outbreak 31 January:The US suspends entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past 14 days. It does not include immediate relatives of American nationals and permanent residents 24 February:President Trump asks Congress for $1.25 billion (Â£1 billion) for the country's response to the virus. 26 February:The US reports its first case of suspected local transmission. 29 February:The first coronavirus death is announced in the country. The government issues ""do not travel"" warnings for countries including China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. 13 March:President Trump declares a national emergency. 17 March:The death toll in the US rises to 100. The deaths were reported in 18 states. 19 March:California becomes first state to order residents to stay at home. 20 March:New York state follows suit, issuing its own stay-at-home order. 22 March:The US records 32,000 cases and at least 400 deaths. 26 March:US confirms 81,321 infections, making it the country with the most confirmed cases. 12 April:The US confirms more than 20,000 deaths. 16 April:President Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases. So far the country has reported over 650,000 cases and over 32,000 deaths. Luiz Henrique Mandetta tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro had handed him his notice Brazil's health minister has been fired by the country's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been at odds for weeks over their differing views on tackling the virus. President Bolsonaro had publicly criticised Luiz Henrique Mandetta for urging people to observe social distancing and stay indoors. The Brazilian leader disagreed with these measures, instead downplaying the virus as ""a little flu"". A total of 1,924 people have died with Covid-19 in Brazil, while the country has had 30,425 confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. However, Brazil tests just under 300 people for every million inhabitants and one group of Brazilian researchers saysthere could be as many as 313,000 cases in Brazil,external. The situation is difficult at Vila Formosa in Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest cemetery,where workers say they bury about 40 people per day. Â© 2025 BBC.

About Â£2m has been lost to coronavirus-related fraud in the UK as criminals look to cash in on the crisis. At least 824 people have fallen victim to Covid-19 scams this year, according to latest figures from Action Fraud. Experts say criminals are playing on virus fears and posing as official sources to obtain details from people seeking compensation. Founder of the Fraud Alert website and former Metropolitan Police detective Colin Holder told the BBC criminals were trading ""templates"" on how to defraud people on the dark web. And analysis shows more than 70,000 ""malicious"" websites have also sprung up since the global pandemic was declared. Retired footballer Dexter Blackstock is using the company he set up after playing tohelp people donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to front line staff dealing with coronavirus. Blackstock featured for Nottingham Forest, Southampton and Leeds United among others and now runs medical technology firm MediConnect. ""We've got the connections to help in this tragic time of need,"" the 33-year-old told BBC East Midlands Today. ""The need for PPE is huge at the moment and when the NHS is struggling to get it."" The foreign secretary says the current lockdown measures will continue for at least three more weeks. A hospital cleaner has completed his 4,500-mile trip from Nepal to north-west London to return to work. Purna Ghale had been in Kathmandu visiting family when his return flight was cancelled.

The foreign secretary, who is giving the government's daily briefing, lists five points that will influence the government's decision: The UK's coronavirus lockdown measureswill be extended for at least three more weeks, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab has announced. Plans to allow MPs to take part in some Parliamentary business virtually have been approved by the body responsible for administration in the Commons. The House of Commons Commission saidministers will be quizzed via Zoomfor the first time in the House's 700-year history. This ""unprecedented step"" will ""keep democracy going"" during the coronavirus crisis, it said. MPs will have to approve the plan next week when they return on 21 April. A popular health care assistant who was ""dedicated to patient care""has died after contracting coronavirus. Lourdes Campbell, who was part of the Bolton NHS Trust nursing team, died at Royal Bolton Hospital on Wednesday, chief executive Fiona Noden said. She said the 54-year-old, who was from the Philippines, had always been ""quiet, diligent and compassionate"". To lose ""a friend and colleague"" of almost 13 years was ""devastating"", she added. And in that government briefing coming up at 17:00 BST, Dominic Raab is expected to confirm that coronavirus lockdown restrictions will continue across the UK. Here are more of the details. The UK government will give its daily briefing at 17:00 BST (16:00 GMT).

Ministers to back three-week lockdown extension,"Ministers are later expected to announce a three-week extension to the coronavirus lockdown. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will lead emergency Cobra committee and cabinet meetings about the continuation of social distancing measures. Labour has said it will support an extension, but also called for details on how and when the lockdown would end. Meanwhile, social care directors have saiddistribution of protective kit for carers has been ""shambolic"". There have been 27 verified deaths with coronavirus among NHS staff, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed. On extending the lockdown, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast he believed the government had been clear ""we think it too early to make a change"". He said: ""We can see that we're reaching a peak, that is good news, but we can see that the numbers are not yet coming down, therefore we can't make a change."" Mr Hancock added that he did not want to put the ""good effort"" of the public to waste by ending the lockdown too early. ""If we just released all the measures now then this virus would run rampant,"" he said. The health secretary is due to meet the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales later ahead of making a formal decision on the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health During Wednesday's daily press briefing, Mr Hancock said restrictions on movement were beginning to help reduce the spread of the virus. The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned of a possible ""bounce"" in the numbers soon, due to delays in reporting deaths over the Easter weekend. He said while the UK was ""probably"" reaching the peak of its epidemic, the high numbers of deaths were expected to continue for a ""short while"" longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducedstrict curbs on life in the UK,externalon 23 March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, people have been allowed to leave home only to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil medical or care needs. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The government - led by Mr Raab as Mr Johnson continues to recover from the virus - will detail the outcome of the first assessment at the daily Downing Street news conference later. All the indications are that the UK is hitting the peak of coronavirus cases. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus seems to be levelling out. There are more than 10,000 beds on general wards available and another 2,000 spaces in intensive care - and that's before you count the capacity available at the Nightingale hospitals. It is this headroom that prompted NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, to declare this week thatit was ""increasingly"" confident the health service could cope. But the government's advisers will be advising ministers that the lockdown should continue. They fear any lifting of restrictions at this stage could undo the good work, and see a spike in cases that would gobble up that spare capacity and overwhelm the health service. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Breakfast he expected the lockdown to be extended for a further three weeks, and that the party would back an extension. But he called for clarity from the government about ""what happens next"" and for a move to a ""testing and contact-tracing strategy"" to exit the lockdown. He said: ""Last night the junior health minister Nadine Dorries was complaining on Twitter that people shouldn't be asking about an exit strategy because there's no exit strategy until we get a vaccine. ""Well that could be 18 months away so if the government are saying we're in lockdown for 18 months they probably need to tell us."" Allow Twitter content?

It described more recent deliveries as ""haphazard"". The group said mixed messages from the government had created ""confusion and additional workload"", as the care sector struggled to cope with the virus. The leak came to light afterthe health secretary launched a new supply network, including an emergency 24/7 helpline, to help get PPE to care home staff. Care providers have been calling for more testing and PPE for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock displays a new ""badge of honour"" designed to recognise the work of carers The Department of Health's statistics have come in for scrutiny in recent days. They do not include deaths in care homes - leading charities to claim the government was ""airbrushing"" the death toll. In Scotland, new figures suggesta quarter of deaths linked to coronavirus have occurred in care homes. In England and Wales there were217 deaths in care homes by 3 April. That number is known to now be much higher. And 24 residentsdied after an outbreak at one care home in Staffordshire. As part of new government guidelines, Mr Hancock announced on Wednesday that family members of dying relatives would be allowed to visit them to say their goodbyes ""wherever possible"". He also promised anyone moving from hospital into social care would be tested for the virus to prevent care home outbreaks. However, critics have questioned the logistics of isolating people as they await test results. Labour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, said few care home staff had been tested so far. In response to Mr Hancock unveiling what he called a ""badge of honour"" to recognise care workers, she told the BBC: ""I think probably what they want more than a brand or a badge is protective equipment, proper testing and a decent salary.""

"Social care virus response sparks 'confusion'Distribution of protective equipment for care workers has been ""shambolic"", say council care bosses.UK Politics","A leaked letter seen by the BBC has revealed an extensive list of concerns about how the social care sector is coping with the coronavirus crisis. The letter raises fears about funding, testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the shielding scheme for vulnerable people. Written on Saturday, to a senior official at the Department of Health and Social Care by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), it says mixed messages from the government have created ""confusion and additional workload"". On protective equipment for care workers, the letter says the national handling has been ""shambolic"". Early drops of equipment have been ""paltry"" and more recent deliveries have been ""haphazard"", with some even being confiscated by border control for the NHS. The letter says there have been contradictory messages from the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department of Health on theshielding schemefor people particularly at risk from the illness. And while the rollout of testing for care workers has been generally welcomed, the letter states ""testing for care workers appears to be being rolled out without being given thought to who is going to be tested and what we are going to do with the result"". Adass is a charity that supports members from all 151 local authorities in England with responsibility for adult social care. Virus tests promised for care homes Close family to be allowed coronavirus goodbyes 'Less than half' of council's PPE order delivered The organisation is also critical of the way central government has recruited volunteers, saying the national scheme has ""diverted 750,000 volunteers away from supporting local communities and left them with nothing to do for the first three weeks"", and claiming it was ""shameful that this was not done in collaboration with local government"". While the letter, alsoreported in the Local Government Chronicle,external, welcomes some of the guidance given by Whitehall, it raises significant concerns about the interaction between central government and local government. It suggests the sector had to make ""invidious decisions before the pandemic"" and now is not being given the same consideration as the NHS. ""We are very concerned that there is a significant imbalance between listening, hearing, and understanding NHS England as opposed to social care,"" it says. The social care system helps and looks after older and disabled people in residential centres and in their own homes. There are more than 400,000 residents in care homes in 15,000 locations in England. Adass has broadly welcomed thehealth secretary's plan to help social care, which was announced on Wednesday. Matt Hancock announced that all care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for coronavirus, as well as any new care home residents being discharged from hospital into care. But senior figures in the care sector say there is scepticism about whether the commitments can be delivered. Responding to Mr Hancock's announcements, Adass said: ""We now have a national strategy; the challenge is now to implement it. Any strategy will ultimately be judged by actions it produces, not words it contains."" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said: ""It's absolutely true that we need to do more - that's why we put the next stages of our action plan out... so we can test all people going from hospital into care homes."" He said that 15% of care homes in the UK have two or more cases of Covid-19. When challenged on that figure - one care home boss, for example, says two thirds of his homes are infected - Mr Hancock said it was a ""robust figure"". He told BBC Breakfast that ""what really matters is availability of testing now in social care"" where he said more than 10,000 tests of residents had been undertaken. Mr Hancock also said his latest figures showed 1,500 care workers were tested on Tuesday, while 4,100 workers have the test ""immediately available to them"". A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the government's plan in England included ""ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes and helping to minimise the spread of the virus to keep people safe"". ""We will continue to work closely with the social care sector to ensure they have everything they need to respond to this outbreak and receive the recognition they deserve,"" they added. The government has also said it is ""committed to ensuring that all areas have access to PPE"" and is ""working round the clock"" with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure supply. It said 38 million items of PPE had been delivered to local resilience forums - multi-agency groups of emergency services and agencies - since last week. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the concerns raised in the letter were ""extremely worrying"". ""Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn't been properly thought through must be an urgent wake up call for ministers,"" she added. ""Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary to halt the emerging crisis in social care.""

When challenged on that figure - one care home boss, for example, says two thirds of his homes are infected - Mr Hancock said it was a ""robust figure"". He told BBC Breakfast that ""what really matters is availability of testing now in social care"" where he said more than 10,000 tests of residents had been undertaken. Mr Hancock also said his latest figures showed 1,500 care workers were tested on Tuesday, while 4,100 workers have the test ""immediately available to them"". A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the government's plan in England included ""ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes and helping to minimise the spread of the virus to keep people safe"". ""We will continue to work closely with the social care sector to ensure they have everything they need to respond to this outbreak and receive the recognition they deserve,"" they added. The government has also said it is ""committed to ensuring that all areas have access to PPE"" and is ""working round the clock"" with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure supply. It said 38 million items of PPE had been delivered to local resilience forums - multi-agency groups of emergency services and agencies - since last week. Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the concerns raised in the letter were ""extremely worrying"". ""Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn't been properly thought through must be an urgent wake up call for ministers,"" she added. ""Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary to halt the emerging crisis in social care.""

"Trump says virus has 'passed the peak' in US""We'll be the comeback kids,"" the president says, predicting some states will reopen this month.US & CanadaPregnant nurse dies from Covid-19 but baby 'well'""Highly valued and loved"" Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong died in hospital in Luton on Sunday.Beds, Herts & Bucks","This video can not be played Michigan residents protest against governor's stay-at-home orders President Donald Trump says the US has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases and predicted some states would reopen this month. Mr Trump told the daily White House briefing that new guidelines would be announced on Thursday after he had spoken to governors. ""We'll be the comeback kids, all of us,"" the president said. ""We want to get our country back."" The US has nearly 640,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 30,900 deaths. Mr Trump's comments came afterNew York City reported a rise in virus fatalities to 10,367. The president has been at loggerheads with state governors about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses. He has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. Follow live updates on coronavirus Lessons from Japan's second wave of infections The Trump administration had previously pencilled in 1 May as a possible date to reopen the nation, and on Wednesday Mr Trump said some states may be able to reopen earlier than that. However, some health experts and state governors have cautioned against re-opening the economy too soon. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the 1 May date was ""a bit overly optimistic"" for many areas of the country, as a strong testing and tracing system was needed before social distancing measures are lifted. ""The data suggests that nationwide, we have passed the peak of new cases,"" Mr Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. ""Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress."" The co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, Deborah Birx, said there had been a national decline in confirmed new daily cases from the recorded peak in recent days. Asked why the US accounted for such a significant proportion of the global coronavirus death toll of more than 137,000, Mr Trump accused other countries of lying about their mortality rate. ""Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?"" he said, naming China. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China must show ""full transparency"" on coronavirus, during a call with his Beijing counterpart, Yang Jiechi, the Department of State said. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Mr Pompeo has repeatedly accused Beijing of covering up the scale of the outbreak in the early days, which China denies. President Trump said the US was looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, rather than in a market in the city. ""I will tell you more and more we're hearing the story and we'll see,"" Mr Trump said when asked about the claims at his daily briefing. This video can not be played Trump says the US is investigating claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab A Fox News report, attributed to several unnamed sources, suggests that the coronavirus was a naturally occurring pathogen that leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols, infecting an intern, who then transmitted it to her boyfriend. US media have previously reported that the US embassy in Beijing had raised concerns about safety at two laboratories in Wuhan in recent years. On Tuesday,the Washington Post said it had obtained cables,externaldating from 2018 warning that one facility was studying bat coronaviruses and looking at the possibility of human transmission, adding that the laboratory had ""a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians"". One theory is that coronavirus originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province However Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that US intelligence services believed it was more likely that the virus occurred naturally. ""There's a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide variety of media... we've taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,"" he said, adding: ""The weight of evidence seems to indicate natural."" Scientists attempting to trace the source of the outbreak have said that a range of wild animal species could be the host, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses. They have been trying to ascertain if the virus that causes the disease Covid-19 originated at a market in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. When questioned about the dangers of reopening too soon, Mr Trump said: ""There's also death involved in keeping it closed."" He cited mental health issues, saying suicide hotlines were ""exploding"" as the economy froze. However the governor of Maryland, Republican Larry Hogan, said on Thursday that now ""would be the worst possible time"" to roll back social distancing in his state. ""Everybody wants to get out economy back,"" he told NBC, but he had to ensure ""we're not just ramping things back up and endangering the lives of thousands of people"". He added that there had been ""a little bit of tension"" between Mr Trump and state governors over when to re-open businesses, ""but ultimately it is going to be the governors that have to make these decisions"". More than 20 million people in the UShave filed unemployment claims over the last four weeks, and experts expect the unemployment rate to hit double digits. Meanwhile, retail sales dropped by 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since tracking began in 1992, according to government data released on Wednesday. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The unexpected items deemed ""essential"" The governors of Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania each issued orders or guidelines that residents should wear face masks as they venture into society in the coming weeks. ""We are going to be getting back to normal - it will be a new normal,"" Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said large gatherings such as sports events and concerts would probably not be allowed in the city until 2021.

Plans to allow MPs to take part in some Parliamentary business virtually have been approved by the body responsible for administration in the Commons. The House of Commons Commission said ministers will be quizzed via Zoom for the first time in the House's 700-year history. This ""unprecedented step"" will ""keep democracy going"" during the coronavirus crisis, it said. MPs will have to approve the plan next week when they return on 21 April. It means that up to 120 MPs will be able to take part in proceedings virtually at any one time, while 50 could remain in the chamber under social distancing rules. The Commons authorities will mark out the 2m (6ft) distance MPs will have to maintain when they go into the chamber. Residents of Charles Street in Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, have been giving an extra loud thanks to NHS staff each Thursday evening. The street was where Aneurin Bevan, the NHS's founder, was born and grew up as a boy. The NHS was founded by Bevan in 1948 while he was minister for health under Clement Attlee's Labour Government.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The thorny issue of masks has been raised again, with the UKâs top doctor Prof Whitty saying itâs far more important for healthcare and care workers to wear facemasks than anyone else. The clear message is that people on the front line are the priority when it comes to masks. But scientific advisers are looking at the evidence on masks again. There is evidence of âa small effectâ from wearing masks, but the UK advice has always been that a mask is more useful to people with symptoms than those without â as well as those caring for people with the virus. For the fourth consecutive week, people across the length and breadth of Wales have taken to their doorways, gardens and windows to celebrate the efforts made by care workers in the fight against coronavirus. Here's how some of you showed your appreciation... Arsonists starting forest fires are ""trying tocause as much chaos as possible""during the coronavirus pandemic. More than 500 fires have been deliberately started in south Wales since the start of March. South Wales fire service wildfire lead Chris Hope told BBC Radio Wales while grass fires were an ongoing problem every year, the number of large forest fires they were seeing was especially problematic during the pandemic. ""We're not having the nuisance fires we'd generally get, we're just having them deliberately set to cause as much chaos as possible,"" he said.  Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old war veteran who has captured hearts in the UK, says he will continue completing laps of his garden despite passing his 100-lap target. Capt Tom originally aimed to raise just Â£1,000 for NHS Charities Together by completing the laps but has now raised almost Â£16m.

Here they are playing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong. The Welsh Government has faced criticism for not meeting a target to provide up to 5,000 tests per day by mid-April. Welsh Tories said testing was ""too big"" a job for the country's Health Minister Vaughan Gething to do by himself. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Mr Gething was doing ""an outstanding job"". But amid complaints that testing in Wales is complex, slow and bureaucratic, Mr Drakeford admitted the system has been too cumbersome and promised to speed it up.

Ministers set to approve lockdown extension,"Ministers are later expected to announce a three-week extension to the coronavirus lockdown. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will lead emergency Cobra committee and cabinet meetings about the continuation of social distancing measures. Labour has said it will support an extension, but also called for details on how and when the lockdown would end. Meanwhile, social care directors have saiddistribution of protective kit for carers has been ""shambolic"". There have been 27 verified deaths with coronavirus among NHS staff, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed. On extending the lockdown, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast he believed the government had been clear ""we think it too early to make a change"". He said: ""We can see that we're reaching a peak, that is good news, but we can see that the numbers are not yet coming down, therefore we can't make a change."" Mr Hancock added that he did not want to put the ""good effort"" of the public to waste by ending the lockdown too early. ""If we just released all the measures now then this virus would run rampant,"" he said. The health secretary is due to meet the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales later ahead of making a formal decision on the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health During Wednesday's daily press briefing, Mr Hancock said restrictions on movement were beginning to help reduce the spread of the virus. The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned of a possible ""bounce"" in the numbers soon, due to delays in reporting deaths over the Easter weekend. He said while the UK was ""probably"" reaching the peak of its epidemic, the high numbers of deaths were expected to continue for a ""short while"" longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducedstrict curbs on life in the UK,externalon 23 March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, people have been allowed to leave home only to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when ""absolutely necessary"", shop for essential items and fulfil medical or care needs. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The government - led by Mr Raab as Mr Johnson continues to recover from the virus - will detail the outcome of the first assessment at the daily Downing Street news conference later. All the indications are that the UK is hitting the peak of coronavirus cases. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus seems to be levelling out. There are more than 10,000 beds on general wards available and another 2,000 spaces in intensive care - and that's before you count the capacity available at the Nightingale hospitals. It is this headroom that prompted NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, to declare this week thatit was ""increasingly"" confident the health service could cope. But the government's advisers will be advising ministers that the lockdown should continue. They fear any lifting of restrictions at this stage could undo the good work, and see a spike in cases that would gobble up that spare capacity and overwhelm the health service. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Breakfast he expected the lockdown to be extended for a further three weeks, and that the party would back an extension. But he called for clarity from the government about ""what happens next"" and for a move to a ""testing and contact-tracing strategy"" to exit the lockdown. He said: ""Last night the junior health minister Nadine Dorries was complaining on Twitter that people shouldn't be asking about an exit strategy because there's no exit strategy until we get a vaccine. ""Well that could be 18 months away so if the government are saying we're in lockdown for 18 months they probably need to tell us."" Allow Twitter content?

Ministers inScotlandandWaleshave already said their lockdowns are set to remain in place, while Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster confirmedthe NI lockdown will be extended until 9 May. According to the latest figures, 12,868 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for the virus in the UK, a day-on-day increase of 761.

It described more recent deliveries as ""haphazard"". The group said mixed messages from the government had created ""confusion and additional workload"", as the care sector struggled to cope with the virus. The leak came to light afterthe health secretary launched a new supply network, including an emergency 24/7 helpline, to help get PPE to care home staff. Care providers have been calling for more testing and PPE for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. Health Secretary Matt Hancock displays a new ""badge of honour"" designed to recognise the work of carers The Department of Health's statistics have come in for scrutiny in recent days. They do not include deaths in care homes - leading charities to claim the government was ""airbrushing"" the death toll. In Scotland, new figures suggesta quarter of deaths linked to coronavirus have occurred in care homes. In England and Wales there were217 deaths in care homes by 3 April. That number is known to now be much higher. And 24 residentsdied after an outbreak at one care home in Staffordshire. As part of new government guidelines, Mr Hancock announced on Wednesday that family members of dying relatives would be allowed to visit them to say their goodbyes ""wherever possible"". He also promised anyone moving from hospital into social care would be tested for the virus to prevent care home outbreaks. However, critics have questioned the logistics of isolating people as they await test results. Labour's shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, said few care home staff had been tested so far. In response to Mr Hancock unveiling what he called a ""badge of honour"" to recognise care workers, she told the BBC: ""I think probably what they want more than a brand or a badge is protective equipment, proper testing and a decent salary.""

Major UK takeaway chains start to reopen,"Three major takeaway chains in the UK have announced limited reopening programmes after closing during the coronavirus lockdown. Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger are opening certain restaurants around the country for delivery only. Government guidelines state that while restaurants and pubs have to close, they can prepare food for collection or delivery. The chains had decided to temporarily close as the lockdown took effect. Burger King is to reopen four restaurants: two in Bristol, one in Coventry, and one in Swindon, with a pared-down menu. Staff will wear masks and gloves and will be trained in running delivery-only kitchens hygienically, the fast food chain said. There will be stringent cleaning measures, and staff will get social distancing training. The restaurants will also donate 1,000 meals per week to staff working at NHS hospitals in the vicinity of the reopened restaurants. Katie Evans, marketing director at the chain, said Burger King hoped the re-openings would go ""some way to lifting our customers' spirits in these difficult times"". She added: ""We want to demonstrate how appreciative everyone at Burger King UK is of [NHS staff] efforts in these unprecedented times."" KFC said it had reopened 11 UK restaurants in the past week for delivery only, with a limited menu. The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. The fast food chain says it has donated ""thousands of meals from all our open restaurants to those on the frontline, including the NHS and key workers, in partnership with Deliveroo, and will continue to do so each week whilst the situation continues"". KFC said it had decided to close temporarily on 23 March ""with the wellbeing of our teams and guests in mind"". A spokesperson said: ""We've spent the time since closure developing new processes to ensure we can reopen carefully and responsibly, which we've now started to do. ""We also saw the impact the situation is having on those who may not be able to easily get to the supermarkets, like key workers. There's a need for affordable, accessible food and we wanted to do our part."" The spokesperson added that furloughed staff would find their jobs ""waiting for them when we are able to fully reopen"". Pret a Manger will reopen 10 shop kitchens near London hospitals from Thursday. ""This allows us to also get our supply chain up and running to donate food to homeless charities, so we will be donating 7,000 additional meals per week to our homeless charity partners,"" the chain said in a statement. NHS workers will get half-price food until the end of April. Pret's chief executive officer Pano Christou wrote in a blog post that NHS workers and hospitals want to be able to get ""freshly made food nearby"". ""We are incredibly grateful that 160 team members have volunteered to help reopen 10 shops in London, located close to hospitals."" Food delivery firm Deliveroo has raised more than Â£1.5m from customer donations and corporate funding for free meals for NHS workers. While the business declined to reveal overall order volumes, it said 3,000 new restaurants had signed up in March. Areport in the Financial Times,externalin March suggested that delivery apps could be feeling the pinch due to restaurant closures and as coronavirus anxiety continues. However, Deliveroo said it is seeing more orders from families, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. The majority of dishes it delivers are pizza, fish and chips, and burgers, it said. It added that it had also started to deliver food from stores including Morrisons, McColls, M&S and BP service stations. Rival delivery firm Just Eat also said that about 3,000 takeaways had signed up since the lockdown was announced. The firm has seen a 36% rise in orders for desserts, and said customers are ordering food earlier in the day, and earlier in the week. While fast food is very popular in the UK, there have been warnings about its effects on people's health for a number of years. In February, BBC One documentary ""The Truth About Takeaways"" found that over two weeks of eating two fast food meals per day, participants gained body fat, which is a marker for increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Eating two takeaways per week ""is associated with increased body weight and various cardiovascular risk markers"", Dr Ian G Davies, Reader in Nutritional Science at Liverpool John Moores University, told the programme. In general, pizza has the highest salt, fat and energy density compared with other fast foods. Shoppers stock up on alcohol amid pub shutdown Why is it so hard to buy flour at the moment?

Apple announces new iPhone SE,"Apple has announced a new iPhone SE, reviving a mid-market brand it had discontinued in 2018. It resembles the form of 2017's iPhone 8 with a 4.7in screen, and a fingerprint ID sensor but not a depth camera for facial recognition. It is powered by the same processor as the flagship iPhone 11 Pro, but lacks multiple rear cameras. The handset costs the same as the original SE in the US, but is more expensive in other markets. The iPhone SE is priced at $399 in the US and Â£419 in the UK. One analyst said that having a mid-range phone again could help Apple compete for new customers against rivals such as Samsung and Google, which have a strong presence in that market sector. ""Once you buy an iPhone you are more likely to buy another one,"" said Dan Iver from Wedbush Securities. Despite Covid-19 causing lower demand, smartphone makers continue to release models.

"'Profound' impact predicted on mental healthConcerns over increased anxiety and isolation are already affecting the public, two surveys suggest.Health","The coronavirus pandemic could have a ""profound"" effect on people's mental health - now and in the future, say psychiatrists and psychologists who are calling for urgent research. Writing in The Lancet Psychiatry,external, they say smartphones should be used to monitor mental health in real time. And support would need to be tailored to specific groups, such as children and front-line health workers. Surveys suggest,externalanxiety and isolation are already affecting the public. Mental health charity Mind said people were already struggling to access the support they needed. Twenty-four leading mental-health experts want widespread ""moment-to-moment"" monitoring of the mental health of the population so that effective tools and support can be designed quickly to help people at home. ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing,"" said Prof Rory O'Connor, one of the paper's authors, from the University of Glasgow. He said doing nothing would risk a rise in conditions such as anxiety and depression, and more people turning to alcohol, drugs and gambling, as well as other consequences, such as homelessness. The paper's authors said the priorities were to monitor rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental-health issues. Kate King has found ways to cope with low-level anxiety Kate King, 57, who has depression, says these are particularly difficult times for people with mental-health conditions. ""Anxiety is a natural response to the situation we are in - I have low-level anxiety all the time. ""You can have waves of it - watching news coverage, thinking about your health and other people..."" But Kate has learnt ways to cope, centring on living for the day - and playing her melodeon (a squeeze box). ""It works for me,"" she says. ""I can't go out for coffee so I sit down with people online, or my two daughters, and have one every morning. ""I try to enjoy what I do minute to minute. ""Just going and putting the washing on is something that doesn't leave you room for worrying around the edges."" Going out for a walk, however, can feel stressful if there are too many people to avoid - and can make things worse, she says. Two online surveys, run by the Academy of Medical Sciences and carried out in late March, present a snapshot of the current state of people's mental health. One by UK charity MQ, covering more than 2,100 people, including many with mental-health conditions, highlighted their concerns about accessing support and services during the pandemic, as well as the fear that their existing health problems might get worse. Another, of 1,099 members of the public, revealed worries about the effects of social isolation and financial difficulties created by the response to the crisis. While a rise in anxiety and stress is expected during the pandemic, the paper says there is a risk that the numbers of people with depression and those self-harming or taking their own lives will increase. During the Sars epidemic of 2003, for example, there was a 30% increase in suicide in the over-65s, the paper says. It added that the policies used to manage the pandemic would ""inevitably have serious effects on mental health by increasing unemployment, financial insecurity and poverty"". The paper lists eight groups that might experience the pandemic differently from the general population: children, young people and families (school closures, domestic violence, no free school meals) older adults and those with underlying health issues (isolation, loneliness, bereavement) people with existing mental-health issues (disruption to services and relapses) front-line healthcare workers (fears of contamination, work stress) people with learning difficulties (changes to routines and support) people on low incomes (job and financial insecurity) prisoners, the homeless and refugees (social exclusion) society in general might experience increased health inequality and a rise in use of food banks ""While it is too soon to see the extent of the damage, we are hearing that people are already struggling to access the support they need,"" says Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. He said people were being discharged from NHS mental-health services, and referrals to children's and adolescent mental-health services and psychological therapies had dropped. ""Government and services need to understand not only how to support people properly now, but also what the long-term impact is likely to be and the services that will need to be put in place to help people rebuild their lives."" Mr Farmer said the longer people went without treatment and support, the more unwell they would become. ""The ultimate consequence of this is a rise in self-harm and suicides."" According to people surveyed: staying connected with friends and family, often online keeping busy with hobbies, crafts, reading, films and home improvements physical activity, such as walking, running and exercise classes staying calm, thanks to mindfulness, meditation, prayer or pets information intake - managing access to news and social media maintaining routine by having a daily plan The experts behind the paper,externalsay almost nothing is known about the effect of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on the human nervous system. But since other coronaviruses have been shown to pass into the central nervous system, the paper recommends more research on the effects of Covid-19 in those areas. Symptoms linked to the brain in people with the infection have been reported, including headaches, dizziness, loss of smell and taste, muscle pain and weakness, among others. The researchers say a database should be set up to monitor any psychological or brain effects of Covid-19.
