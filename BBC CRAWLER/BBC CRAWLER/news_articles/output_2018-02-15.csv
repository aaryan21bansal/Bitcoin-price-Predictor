Boy rescued from waist deep mud,"The boy was said to be suffering from shock and hypothermia A 12-year-old boy has been rescued after he was stuck for more than an hour up to his waist in mud. Nearly 40 coastguards, firefighters, police, ambulance and lifeboat crews fought to free the boy on the Solway coast in Dumfries and  Galloway. The boy had been fishing near Kippford when he got stuck in the River Urr estuary at Rough Firth. He was treated at the scene by paramedics, then taken to hospital, suffering from shock and hypothermia. The alarm was raised by people on the shore who spotted the boy sinking into the mud. Coastguards from nearby Portling and Annan, 35 miles away, rushed to the scene along with firefighters from Dalbeattie, Castle Douglas and Dumfries. The Kippford inshore lifeboat and Annan coastguard boat also took part in the rescue. Police tweeted a picture of the scene The boy was eventually pulled to safety and treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken by ambulance to Dumfries Infirmary. A spokesman for Belfast coastguard, which co-ordinated the rescue operation, said: ""Fortunately it had a happy ending but people must realise the hazards and dangers at the seaside. ""The lad was eventually brought out just as darkness was starting to fall. We're just pleased it had a happy ending. ""The mud may look safe but it can be extremely dangerous and it is very difficult for rescuers to get out to some people who get stuck."" A Police Scotland spokesman said; ""At 4pm today, emergency services responded to calls reporting a distressed 12-year-old boy was stuck, waist deep, in the mud near Kippford. ""Around an hour later the emergency services were able to free the boy from the mud/water and get him safely back to shore. ""A good news story and a great bit of multi-agency teamwork.""

Bannon 'stonewalled' lawmakers in hearing,"Mr Bannon photographed during his arrival at the House intelligence committee earlier today President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has been interviewed as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He met with special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the inquiry, over two days this week. Mr Bannon was chairman of Mr Trump's presidential campaign before becoming a top White House official. But he left his post in August amid reports of tension with other aides. Mr Mueller is leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the US election. Both Moscow and Mr Trump deny this. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Investigators believe Mr Bannon may hold crucial information on the Trump administration, including details on why former FBI Director James Comey was fired by the president. Mr Comey has previously said he has ""no doubt"" that he was fired by Mr Trump to ""change"" the Russia investigation, a charge the White House denies. It is not clear what Mr Bannon was questioned about, but he is reported to have spent around 20 hours speaking with Mr Mueller's team. A source close to the process though told the Associated Press thatMr Bannon answered every question put to him,external. Robert Mueller is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign This inquiry is running alongside four similar ones being conducted by politicians in Congress, and Mr Bannon spoke to one of them on Thursday. He appeared in front of the House intelligence committee as part of their own, separate, investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he frustrated the committee when he refused to answer their questions, opting instead to answer 25 pre-written questions that had been approved by the White House. The dates that define Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall It led top Democrats to call for contempt proceedings against Mr Bannon. ""There was a refusal to answer any questions that would have brought out the full facts. That is not how privilege works. That's how stonewalling works,"" the panel's Democratic leader Adam Schiff said. In a tweet, Democratic member Joaquin Castro also accused Mr Bannon of stonewalling. Allow Twitter content?

""He did not answer all the questions we'd like answered, so there was frustration among committee members with respect to that,"" he said. It is not the first time Mr Bannon has been criticised by the panel. He voluntarily met with the same committee in January and refused to answer their questions over a 10-hour period. The committee then issued a subpoena compelling him to return for a second time. But Mr Bannon was reportedly advised by President Trump to invoke executive privilege, a prerogative allowing him to withhold information.

Woman told 'you can't handle the pace',"Ms Forcada said she felt discriminated against after receiving a job rejection for not being a man A Spanish company has been criticised for allegedly rejecting a woman for a job on the grounds she was not a man. PR agency Impulsa ComunicaciÃ³n told Carla Forcada the account executive role ""needed a man who could handle the pace of working with big companies"". The agency has now been dropped by Coca-Cola and other firms after she posted about it on social media. The PR agency said that it was never its intention to discriminate against Ms Forcada. But Ms Forcada, 25, shared a screenshot of a message that read: ""Believe me, they need a man.""

Transgender woman 'breastfeeds baby',"A transgender woman has been able to breastfeed a baby in the first recorded case of its kind, researchers say. The 30-year-old wanted to breastfeed after her pregnant partner said she did not want to do it herself,according to the Transgender Health journal,external. She was able to breastfeed after taking a course of drugs and breast pumping, the US case report said. A UK expert said the ""exciting"" research could lead to more cases of transgender women breastfeeding. Paying mothers can 'incentivise breastfeeding' UK 'world's worst' at breastfeeding Transgender people face two-year wait The woman had been on hormone replacement therapy for six years, but had not gender reassignment surgery, when she approached doctors with the aim of breastfeeding the child. Before the baby was born, doctors put her on a three-and-a-half-month course of treatment to help her artificially produce milk, usually given to women who have adopted babies or who have them via surrogates. This included breast pumping, taking hormones produced by biological mothers, a drug which can stimulate milk production and a male hormone blocker. As a result, the woman was able to produce a ""modest but functional"" amount of breast milk - some 8oz a day. Researchers said this was the baby's only source of nutrition for its first six weeks, during which time her growth, feeding and bowel habits were ""developmentally appropriate"". After this, the baby also started having formula milk because not enough breast milk was being produced. The baby is now six months old and she continues to be breastfed as part of her diet, the study's authors said. Researchers said further investigation was needed to determine the optimal treatment for transgender women wishing to breastfeed Dr Channa Jayasena, a senior lecturer at Imperial College who specialises in reproductive endocrinology, said the research was an ""exciting development"". He said he had heard of a few cases in the UK of transgender women being helped to breastfeed, but until now no report has been published. Dr Jayasena added: ""What we really need to do is pool together these cases and share our knowledge, to find the best recipe for breastfeeding in these patients without exposing them to any health risks."" The researchers said it was not clear whether all of the medications used in the woman's treatment were necessary to achieve lactation. They said further investigation was needed to determine the optimal treatment for transgender women wishing to breastfeed.

Oxfam rehired man fired over sex claims,"Oxfam said its decision to rehire the man in Ethiopia was a ""serious error"" An Oxfam worker fired over sexual misconduct allegations in Haiti was rehired later the same year by the charity. Oxfam said its decision to rehire the man in Ethiopia was a ""serious error"". It said it was still looking into how the decision had been made and whether there were ""any issues"" while the man was working in Ethiopia. Oxfam has faced mounting criticism over the way it handled claims staff used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked, including the man who was rehired, and three others resigning. The man who was rehired worked in Ethiopia from October to December 2011. In a statement, the charity said the rehiring error highlighted that ""an organisation and sector-wide approach"" to recruitment and the vetting of staff and consultants was needed, ""especially in emergencies where there is pressure to fill posts quickly in order to help save lives"". Separately, the former Oxfam director accused of hiring prostitutes while working in Haiti and Chad,Roland van Hauwermeiren, has denied paying for sexbut admitted some ""mistakes"". He said he had ""intimate relations"" with a woman in earthquake-stricken Haiti who was ""not a prostitute"". Actress quits Oxfam over Haiti sex claims How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? On Thursday, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt met law enforcement officials to discuss how vulnerable aid recipients can be protected from abuse. The National Crime Agency said the ""productive"" meeting discussed how to guarantee ""appropriate safeguarding provisions"" were in place. The Charity Commission also gave details on the scope of its statutory inquiry into Oxfam, saying it ""will establish the facts about what the charity knew about events in Haiti in 2011, and how it responded at the time and since"". It added that the inquiry will seek to ""understand Oxfam's overall approach to safeguarding,"" in order to uphold trust in the charity. Meanwhile, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has become the latest high-profile figure to end his ties with Oxfam over the scandal. In a statement Mr Tutu said he was ""deeply disappointed by allegations of immorality and possible criminality involving humanitarian workers linked to"" the charity. He added that he was stepping down from his role as a global ambassador.

Man stole Â£5m from wife to buy football club,"Sulaiman Al Fahim (right) was in charge of Portsmouth for six weeks in 2009 The man who owned Portsmouth for six weeks during an ill-fated spell in 2009 has been sentenced to five years in a United Arab Emirates jail for stealing Â£5m from his wife to fund the purchase. Sulaiman Al Fahim, who also fronted the Abu Dhabi United Group's deal to buy Manchester City in 2008, was found guilty of forgery, using forged documents and aiding and abetting. He and an accomplice were found to have stolen the money used to buy Pompey from Sacha Gaydamak, with Al Fahim soon selling the club to Ali Al Faraj. Al Fahim, 42, did not attend the hearing and was sentenced in his absence. Prosecutors said that Al Fahim's wife discovered the money was missing after the returns she had expected from a high interest rate account she opened in 2009 did not come in. She said she contacted the bank's accounts manager, but he ""kept stalling"" despite her asking him to move the account in September 2011. When she decided to visit the bank in person, she was told there was no money in the account. She then went to the bank's legal affairs department, and when they failed to take action she reported the matter to the police. Dubai Criminal Court also convicted the bank manager of theft, forgery of official documents and use of forged official documents. He was also sentenced to five years in prison. At the time of Al Fahim's ownership, Portsmouth were in the Premier League but the club was also in financial difficulty and had struggled to pay players and staff. Four years later, Pompey had gone into administration twice, suffered three relegations and had seven different owners. In 2013, it was taken over by the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), who sold it to former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner in August 2017. Last season the club was promoted from League Two to League One. They are currently ninth in the table. In a 2009 interview with Radio Solent conducted after he had bought Portsmouth, Al Fahim said: ""To be realistic we need a new ground and we want to strengthen the squad and the academy. ""Hopefully we can have a new stadium in place by 2015 or 16. We would like to be a top-eight club by that time.""

What we know about the suspect,"Nikolas Cruz is facing 17 counts of murder A grimly familiar picture is building of the suspect in America's latest mass shooting as a depressed loner with a fixation on violence and weapons. One student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, said that many pupils had previously joked Nikolas Cruz, 19, would be ""the one to shoot up the school"". The orphan was expelled for disciplinary reasons from the high school he has now confessed to attacking. Florida shooting victims details emerge This video can not be played ""We knew it wasn't a drill"": Students, police and politicians react in the aftermath of the shooting Mr Cruz admitted he had carried out the attack, even after learning that his admission could incriminate him, according to police documents. Maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald: ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" He added that the school had sent out an email warning teachers about Mr Cruz's threats. Mr Gard said the suspect was so obsessed with one girl at the school it approached ""the point of stalking her"". Eddie Bonilla, a former classmate, told local media that many students predicted Mr Cruz was behind the shooting. ""We actually, a lot of kids threw jokes around like that, saying that he's the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out everyone predicted it. It's crazy,"" he told a local CBS affiliate. Chad Williams, 18, told Reuters news agency Mr Cruz was ""crazy about guns"" and would regularly set off the fire alarm before he was eventually thrown out of the school for fighting. This was a picture found on Mr Cruz's now deleted Instagram account ""He was kind of an outcast. He didn't have many friends,"" he said. Another former schoolmate, Joshua Charo, said bullets had been found in Mr Cruz's backpack. Nikolas Cruz was arrested an hour after the attack Knives and guns feature in images taken from now-deleted Instagram accounts that apparently belonged to Mr Cruz. One picture shows a box of ammunition and another rifles on a bed. In several images a masked man is shown holding up large knives to the camera. One of the Instagram accounts shows Mr Cruz wearing a Make America Great Again hat - worn by supporters of President Donald Trump - with a red, white and blue bandana masking his face, according to CBS News. Two students also told the Daily Beast website that the suspect was previously seen wearing the hat at school.

US children learn 'lockdown drill' Shelby Speno, who once lived near the suspect,told the Orlando Sentinel,externalthat ""creepy"" Mr Cruz was a known local troublemaker. She said he had shot at a householder's chickens, bitten a child, stole residents' post and threw eggs at her car while she was driving.

""That child had an extremely cold stare,"" former neighbour Rhonda Roxburgh, 45,told the Miami Herald,external. ""He was going to hurt somebody. I just didn't know it would be this bad.""

Man in Oxfam scandal denies paying for sex,"Roland Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 The former Oxfam director accused of hiring prostitutes while working in Haiti and Chad has denied paying for sex, but admitted some ""mistakes"". In an open letter, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, 68, denied that a reception he hosted in Haiti was, as alleged, a sex party. He said he had ""intimate relations"" with a woman in earthquake-stricken Haiti who was ""not a prostitute"". The scandal has put Oxfam at risk of losing funding from the UK and the EU. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has become the latest high-profile figure to end his ties with Oxfam over the scandal. He will no longer be an ambassador for Oxfam. A statement said the 86-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate was ""deeply disappointed by allegations of immorality and possible criminality involving humanitarian workers linked to the charity"". TheUK charity commission has launched a statutory inquiryamid claims that Oxfam covered up cases of sexual misconduct in Haiti. Archbishop Tutu is ""deeply disappointed"" over alleged misconduct at Oxfam UK newspaper The Times has accused Mr Van Hauwermeiren ofusing prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam,externalwhile he was in the country delivering aid after the 2010 earthquake. A source described the events - which happened when he was director of mission - as sex parties. He left his post in 2011 amid an inquiry by Oxfam into claims of sexual misconduct by staff. In an open letter to Belgian media (in Dutch),Mr Van Hauwermeiren said he had resigned for failing to control rumours about sex scandals,externalinvolving Oxfam in Haiti and for ""feeding the rumours"" through his own relationship with a Haitian woman. ""In early 2011, I had to dismiss two internationals because of clear indications (no witnesses) of prostitutes who had been lured to their rooms... ""I was nicknamed 'the terminator' as I acted so severely in this case."" Mr Van Hauwermeiren was Oxfam's country director in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake He said he had never visited a brothel or nightclub in Haiti and audits had ""never shown that funds were used to finance excesses or sex parties"". Referring to the two staff dismissals, and some other resignations ""because of serious suspicions"", he said ""reporting in the media is almost correct"". ""I'm not a saint, I'm a man of flesh and blood and have made mistakes (not easy to admit), and I am deeply ashamed,"" he said. Haitian Oxfam workers tried to warn of sex scandal before Oxfam worker rehired after being dismissed Mr Van Hauwermeiren has also been accused of using prostitutes while working for British health charity Merlin in Liberia from 2002-04, according toa former colleague who spoke to the IRIN website.,external Merlin later merged with Save the Children, which says it does not have access to Merlin's records. According to Mr Van Hauwermeiren, he and two colleagues in Liberia were dismissed after mixing with two women who ""turned out to be prostitutes"". He said he had just ""danced and flirted with them"". He was then hired by Oxfam as a country director in Chad. Under his leadership there, in 2006,staff used prostitutes in the charity's premises,,externalaccording to UK newspaper Observer, claims that Oxfam said it could not corroborate.

Ovarian cancer link to paternal genesMany cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer might actually be inherited from paternal genes.2m3 minutes agoHealth,"US scientists believe they have identified a new gene mutation that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, and is passed from father to daughter. It is inherited through the X-chromosome and is independent of other known susceptibility genes that women can already be tested for. Experts say more studies are needed to confirm the identity and function of the gene. The latest findings appear in the journalPLoS Genetics,external. Currently, women with a strong family history of cancer can be tested for the BRCA gene, which greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Angelina Jolie inherited BRCA1 from her mother- she had preventative surgery after her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. Butresearchers,externalbelieve there may be many other cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer that are actually inherited - some via the X chromosome girls get from their father. Angelina Jolie had her first preventative surgery in 2013 Men pass on one X chromosome to their daughters. Dr Kevin Eng and colleagues at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute honed in on one suspect gene, called MAGEC3, located on the X chromosome from fathers. Ovarian cancers linked to genes inherited from the father (and paternal grandmother) had an earlier age-of-onset than ones linked to maternal genes, and were also associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in fathers and sons. Lead author Kevin Eng from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Buffalo, New York said: ""What we have to do next is make sure we have the right gene by sequencing more families. This finding has sparked a lot of discussion within our group about how to find these X-linked families. ""It's an all-or-none kind of pattern:  A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations."" Most women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damage to the DNA in our cells. If people inherit a mutated version of either of these genes it puts them at greater risk of certain cancers. BRCA 1 mutation gives women a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%. If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops. Angelina Jolie had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removedwhen she found she had BRCA1 Dr Catherine Pickworth from Cancer Research UK said: ""This research suggests that some women's risk of ovarian cancer could be passed down through their father's family, as well as their mother's, due to newly discovered faulty genes. ""In future, this could help women with a family history of ovarian cancer better understand their risk of developing the disease. This is important because ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when it's harder to treat. Further work is now needed to get a clearer picture of how the genetic faults uncovered in this research might affect inherited risk of ovarian cancer."" Annwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""These findings, if borne out by further research, would represent a significant step forward in ovarian cancer prevention, saving thousands of lives"".

"Bannon 'stonewalled' lawmakers in hearingSteve Bannon, a former top adviser to Donald Trump, refused to answer questions posed by lawmakers.11m11 minutes agoUS & Canada","Mr Bannon photographed during his arrival at the House intelligence committee earlier today President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has been interviewed as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He met with special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the inquiry, over two days this week. Mr Bannon was chairman of Mr Trump's presidential campaign before becoming a top White House official. But he left his post in August amid reports of tension with other aides. Mr Mueller is leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the US election. Both Moscow and Mr Trump deny this. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Investigators believe Mr Bannon may hold crucial information on the Trump administration, including details on why former FBI Director James Comey was fired by the president. Mr Comey has previously said he has ""no doubt"" that he was fired by Mr Trump to ""change"" the Russia investigation, a charge the White House denies. It is not clear what Mr Bannon was questioned about, but he is reported to have spent around 20 hours speaking with Mr Mueller's team. A source close to the process though told the Associated Press thatMr Bannon answered every question put to him,external. Robert Mueller is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign This inquiry is running alongside four similar ones being conducted by politicians in Congress, and Mr Bannon spoke to one of them on Thursday. He appeared in front of the House intelligence committee as part of their own, separate, investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he frustrated the committee when he refused to answer their questions, opting instead to answer 25 pre-written questions that had been approved by the White House. The dates that define Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall It led top Democrats to call for contempt proceedings against Mr Bannon. ""There was a refusal to answer any questions that would have brought out the full facts. That is not how privilege works. That's how stonewalling works,"" the panel's Democratic leader Adam Schiff said. In a tweet, Democratic member Joaquin Castro also accused Mr Bannon of stonewalling. Allow Twitter content?

Republican Representative Mike Conaway said members of the panel were unhappy with Mr Bannon's responses. ""He did not answer all the questions we'd like answered, so there was frustration among committee members with respect to that,"" he said. It is not the first time Mr Bannon has been criticised by the panel. He voluntarily met with the same committee in January and refused to answer their questions over a 10-hour period. The committee then issued a subpoena compelling him to return for a second time. But Mr Bannon was reportedly advised by President Trump to invoke executive privilege, a prerogative allowing him to withhold information.

Brother's plea to man missing on stag doThere's still no trace of the 29-year-old from Inverness after he disappeared on Saturday morning.1han hour agoNewsbeat,"This video can not be played Eamonn Colgan has given an emotional appeal for his brother to come home The brother of Liam Colgan, who disappeared on a stag do in Hamburg, has issued a plea for him to get in touch. Meanwhile German police have said they have ""ever growing concern"" for him. Liam, 29, from Inverness, went missing on Saturday during a trip to Germany ahead of his brother Eamonn's wedding. The family revealed police are investigating a possible sighting of a ""confused"" man on Wednesday in the Buxtehude area of the city. Speaking to Newsbeat in Hamburg, Eamonn has sent a message to Liam, saying: ""Please, please come home. Everyone misses you. You're very much loved."" ""I don't know what happened to you, just please get in touch, find a way."" Eamonn, 33, is supposed to be getting married in two weeks' time. Liam had organised the whole stag do and was in charge of all the arrangements. Hamburg police have told Newsbeat they are ""not actively looking"" for Liam in the Elbe (the city's main river) - but say they're doing everything they can to find him. Officers say they acted ""very, very quickly"" when he was reported missing. ""We came to the conclusion that, even though this is a 29-year-old male, he was highly alcoholised in a city he doesn't know, possibly without orientation,"" a police spokesperson told Newsbeat. ""So we have to presume, especially with the temperatures outside, that this is in fact a threat to his life and wellbeing."" The group arrived in Hamburg last Friday and headed out to the Reeperbahn area of the city. It's famous for its nightlife - from bars and restaurants to sex shops and strip clubs. ""We went to a few different bars and by the end of the night our group had splintered a bit - that's what happens on nights out,"" says Eamonn. The last bar they were in was the Hamborger Viermaster. ""We thought Liam had left just a couple of minutes before us,"" remembers Eamonn. ""When he wasn't waiting for us outside, there was no reason to panic. He'd organised the whole trip so he'd researched the city and knew better than any of us how to get home."" But when Eamonn woke the next morning, Liam wasn't there. Liam Colgan was celebrating his brother's stag do when he went missing ""That's when panic set in. I was sharing a room with him. We looked in all the other rooms but there was no sign of him."" Eamonn was worried enough to go straight to the police. But because it's not uncommon for people to go missing on stag nights, officers in Hamburg couldn't treat it as a missing persons case until 24 hours had passed. ""We knew something was wrong. ""He would've returned, he would've known we'd be worrying - especially as his mobile phone battery had died so he knew we couldn't contact him."" Eamonn and Liam's dad had been on the trip too. But calling his mum back home was hard. ""I don't think she really took it in - I think she thought he'd just turn up. ""It's probably more difficult now when he's been missing a few days. I find talking to the media much easier than calling home - because that's when it gets upsetting."" Eamonn's stag do Officers in Hamburg have made contact with hospitals and taxi companies, used search dogs, conducted witness interviews, published photographs in newspapers, TV and online and tried to find his mobile phone. Initially Eamonn, a police officer himself, went home. ""Going back without him was horrible. I felt guilty about leaving,"" he says. He's now back in the German city to help the police and is trying to get Liam's face shown around Hamburg as much as possible. Liam was last seen in Hamburg in the early hours of Saturday ""We are getting more people coming forward. We don't know if it'll lead to anything but it makes me feel more positive. ""We just have to keep thinking we'll get that bit of information that we need to find him and get him home."" Until Liam's family finds out what happened, Eamonn's wedding won't be a priority. ""The wedding is not even a thought to me or my fiancee"", he says. ""It won't be going ahead without Liam. ""I can't even say 'if'. When we bring him home, we can worry about the wedding. It's not a thought just now. We're just doing whatever we can to find him.""

Divorcing couples may clash over BitcoinLawyers say the anonymous nature of digital currencies could prove tempting for those trying to hide wealth.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Divorcing couples are being warned to disclose all their assets amid fears that some may use digital currencies such as Bitcoin to hide their wealth. Lawyers suggest that the anonymous nature of these digital currencies could prove tempting to those involved in an acrimonious split. One solicitor said she had seen the ""first wave"" of cases where crypto-currencies were listed as assets. Courts have wide-ranging powers to investigate hidden assets. This could include a court appointing a digital forensic expert to analyse data when it is suspected someone is trying to hide money in cryptocurrency, The financial implications of divorce Virgin Money joins ban on buying Bitcoin on credit cards Vandana Chitroda, a partner at law firm Royds Withy King, said it was dealing with three cases in which the husband had bought crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum. ""These are the first cases we have seen, and we expect to see many more.  There will also be those divorces where a spouse may not have disclosed such assets, leaving a traceability nightmare,"" she said. Jacqueline Fitzgerald, partner at Wilsons law firm, said: ""Proving that one spouse has a substantial holding in a cryptocurrency and adding that to the marital assets can be a big problem."" The fact that there is no centralised system or opportunity to freeze these assets could cause difficulties, she suggested. This potentially made cases trickier than those when people tried to hide art or antiques, which were more easily traced. There was also a lack of guidance from the courts as to how these issues should be dealt with, mainly owing to the relatively recent emergence of mainstream cryptocurrency investment. There is no specific guidance from the Ministry of Justice, but the Advice Now guide, drafted by the Family Justice Council, says that both parties ""need to be honest about what you own and what income you have"". Ms Chitroda said that lawyers and their advisers, like many of their clients, had little experience in recovering and valuing these cryptocurrencies. In one of the cases her firm is dealing with, an original investment of Â£80,000 in November 2016 was valued at Â£1m in December 2017 and was now ""worth"" Â£600,000. She said that the divorce process took eight months on average, so numerous valuations would be needed for the court to be given accurate information.

"Diet pill overdose death 'huge mistake'On the anniversary of her death, Beth Shipsey's parents say she did not mean to take her own life.5h5 hours agoHereford & Worcester","This video can not be played Doug Shipsey has challenged the government over his daughter's death The parents of a woman who overdosed on diet pills have rejected a coroner's finding of suicide. Beth Shipsey, 21, died after taking pills containing highly-toxic DNP in 2017. Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams concluded Ms Shipsey intended to take her own life and would have diedregardless of medical failings. But her father Doug said her death ""was a miscalculation, a huge mistake. It was another cry for help"". Midlands Live: Men 'stabbed in neck with Biro'; pollution probe after many fish found dead The inquest, which concluded on Wednesday, heard how Ms Shipsey had ongoing treatment for mental health issues, but was ""not considered a suicide risk"", despite previously taking 14 overdoses. She was on home leave from a psychiatric unit on the day she died. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire show on the anniversary of their daughter's death, Carole and Doug Shipsey said they were ""disappointed in the verdict"" of suicide. ""There's so much evidence that wasn't the case,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""There was no suicide note, no social media messages she left. ""That would indicate she meant to be found and taken to hospital and treated."" Ms Shipsey had taken 14 overdoses previously, her inquest heard Coroner Mr Williams also spoke of ""serious failures"" in Ms Shipsey's care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. But they ""became irrelevant"" as ""evidence suggests she would have died anyway"", he said. Mrs Shipsey disagreed and said she believed her daughter would have survived if she had received care earlier. ""People have survived with a higher level [of DNP in their blood] that have had supportive care,"" she said. ""Beth had no care in the four-and-a-half hours she was there."" Mrs Shipsey said she was not aware of the ""potency and toxicity"" of the diet pills her daughter was ordering online. She encouraged others to be ""aware"" and ""proactive"" about the dangers of DNP. ""We don't want people to think there's a safe therapeutic dose,"" Mrs Shipsey said. ""An envelope coming through the door with pills in it could be a killer,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""As turned out to be the case with Beth."" The pills taken by Ms Shipsey have ""no known antidote"" After the inquest, the trust in charge of the hospital apologised after there were found to have been ""significant failings"" in Ms Shipsey's care. It said it has ""made a series of improvements"" to address the issues highlighted by the coroner. The coroner's office declined to comment. 2,4-dinitrophenol, or DNP, is highly toxic and not intended for human consumption An industrial chemical, it is sold illegally in diet pills as a fat-burning substance Users experience a metabolism boost, leading to weight loss, but taking even a few tablets can be fatal Signs of acute poisoning include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heartbeat Consuming lower amounts over longer periods could lead to cataracts and skin lesions and impact on the heart, blood and nervous system Experts say buying drugs online is risky as medicines may be fake, out of date or extremely harmful Girl's diet pill death 'was suicide' Nurses missed note on diet pill drugs Diet pill death at overcrowded A&E Hospital missed diet pill overdose Mother's anger over diet pill death.

Man stole Â£5m from wife to buy football clubSulaiman Al Fahim is sentenced to five years in a United Arab Emirates jail for stealing Â£5m from his wife to buy Portsmouth.4h4 hours agoBBC Sport,"Sulaiman Al Fahim (right) was in charge of Portsmouth for six weeks in 2009 The man who owned Portsmouth for six weeks during an ill-fated spell in 2009 has been sentenced to five years in a United Arab Emirates jail for stealing Â£5m from his wife to fund the purchase. Sulaiman Al Fahim, who also fronted the Abu Dhabi United Group's deal to buy Manchester City in 2008, was found guilty of forgery, using forged documents and aiding and abetting. He and an accomplice were found to have stolen the money used to buy Pompey from Sacha Gaydamak, with Al Fahim soon selling the club to Ali Al Faraj. Al Fahim, 42, did not attend the hearing and was sentenced in his absence. Prosecutors said that Al Fahim's wife discovered the money was missing after the returns she had expected from a high interest rate account she opened in 2009 did not come in. She said she contacted the bank's accounts manager, but he ""kept stalling"" despite her asking him to move the account in September 2011. When she decided to visit the bank in person, she was told there was no money in the account. She then went to the bank's legal affairs department, and when they failed to take action she reported the matter to the police. Dubai Criminal Court also convicted the bank manager of theft, forgery of official documents and use of forged official documents. He was also sentenced to five years in prison. At the time of Al Fahim's ownership, Portsmouth were in the Premier League but the club was also in financial difficulty and had struggled to pay players and staff. Four years later, Pompey had gone into administration twice, suffered three relegations and had seven different owners. In 2013, it was taken over by the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), who sold it to former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner in August 2017. Last season the club was promoted from League Two to League One. They are currently ninth in the table. In a 2009 interview with Radio Solent conducted after he had bought Portsmouth, Al Fahim said: ""To be realistic we need a new ground and we want to strengthen the squad and the academy. ""Hopefully we can have a new stadium in place by 2015 or 16. We would like to be a top-eight club by that time."" PST spokesperson Ashley Brown told BBC Sport the case ""once again raises questions about how owners can purchase football clubs"". The Premier League has tightened its rules on ownership since Al Fahim's brief spell, and stricter criteria now have to be met than at the time of his takeover - with changes introduced largely as a result of the club's tumultuous ownership history.

Justice has been served - Bennell victims,"This video can not be played February 2018: Chris Unsworth, Micky Fallon and Steven Walters Three of Barry Bennell's victims have told how he turned their dreams into a ""horrendous nightmare"" after the former youth football coach was convicted of 43 sex assaults on boys. Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was found guilty of abusing 11 boys aged eight to 15. Speaking outside Liverpool Crown Court, another victim, Andy Woodward, said ""justice has been served"". It is understood 86 others have come forward to say they were victims. The jury, which deliberated over five days, had been told of Bennell's abuse of 12 boys between 1979 and 1990. Before the case he admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys, two of whom were also part of the allegations he was tried on. 'My dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell' A cruel paedophile who showed no remorse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' He was found guilty of 36 charges on Tuesday, and a further seven counts on Thursday. Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, appeared in court via videolink during the five-week trial due to illness. He could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were returned by a 10-1 majority. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" He will be sentenced on Monday and will be produced from custody to attend the hearing. It was the fourth time Bennell had been convicted of abusing boys. The jury was told he hadpreviously received jail sentences in the UK and in the USin 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest police investigation began in November 2016 when Andy Woodward gave interviews about his experiences to the Guardian and BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Speaking outside court after the verdict, the ex-Crewe defender said: ""Justice has been served today and people will be able to move on with their lives including myself."" This video can not be played Andy Woodward says 'justice has been served' Mr Woodward said he believed ""the football clubs that were accountable for this... could have stopped this for so many years... And I think now's the time that that comes sort of out. ""And I would personally like after 15 months, an apology from Crewe Alexandra for what happened to us boys."" Ex-Manchester City youth player Chris Unsworth, who was abused by Bennell when he was a scout at the club, stood alongside Micky Fallon and Steve Walters as he read a statement. The three men are supporters of the Offside Trust, which was set up by ex-professional players to support abuse survivors. Mr Unsworth said: ""We stand before you today as men united in justice, but this is about so much more than us."" Mr Fallon, who was targeted by Bennell at Crewe, said: ""We stand before you today as men united but, at the same time, we were very young boys. We were little boys with a dream and our innocence was shattered. Our dreams turned into the most horrendous nightmare."" Bary Bennell could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were announed Prosecutors described Bennell as a ""predatory paedophile"" who abused boys on an ""industrial scale"". They told the trial he had a ""power hold"" over the aspiring professional players. Boys were abused at his home - including a property in Derbyshire where he had arcade games and a puma and a monkey - on trips away, and in his car on the way to and from training, they said. Det Insp Sarah Oliver, who led the investigation, said Bennell had betrayed the trust of the young players. ""As a football coach he should have provided nothing more than safety and support for the players in his care,"" she said. ""Instead he abused them. He also abused the trust of their families who had placed them into that care so they could pursue their dreams of being professional footballers. He has shattered those dreams and left them burdened for decades."" In a statement, Crewe Alexandra expressed its ""deepest sympathies"" to Bennell's victims and said it worked closely with the police investigation. It added it was was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell or had received any complaint before or during his employment with the club. Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Manchester City offered ""heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured"". The club said it was keen to speak to any survivor or witness to sexual abuse which might be connected to Manchester City or which could support a review it launched after the latest allegations were raised in 2016. It added its review also identified serious allegations of child sex abuse in respect of a second man with ""potential historic connections to the club"". The man is now dead and is not believed to be linked to Bennell. The Football Association said it acknowledged the ""traumatic experience"" of Bennell's victims ""and the bravery they have shown in coming forward"". It said an independent inquiry into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse in football had been set up and also urged victims and survivors to contact police ""if they are ready to do so"". This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police how he groomed young boys Bennell chose not to offer any evidence or witnesses in his defence and had told police he was suffering from cancer, which in turn had caused memory problems. His barrister accused the complainants of inventing stories about him and ""jumping on the bandwagon"". During the trial, the judge, Recorder of Liverpool, Clement Goldstone QC, had directed the jury to find Bennell not guilty on three charges of indecent assault.

FBI was warned about Florida gunman,"This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' The FBI has launched a review over its handling of a warning about the teenager accused of carrying out Wednesday's school shooting in Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, has appeared in court charged with premeditated murder. With 17 people killed, this is the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. Mr Cruz reportedly commented on a YouTube post last year that he would be a ""professional school shooter"". The FBI admitted that a user had alerted authorities to the post. Teachers were also warned about Mr Cruz, who was not allowed on campus with a backpack, US media report. The FBI said it had investigated the YouTube comment but had been unable to fully identify the person who posted it. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The attack happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Fourteen people were wounded, three of whom remain in a critical condition. On Thursday, Mr Cruz confessed to investigators that he carried out the shooting, adding that he had a backpack full of ammunition. Expressing his condolences earlier, US President Donald Trump said he was ""making plans to visit"" Parkland. This video can not be played Florida shooting suspect appears in court After seeing a comment on a YouTube post last year by Mr Cruz, user Ben Bennight contacted the FBI and spoke to representatives for about 20 minutes. Mr Bennight said the FBI contacted him again following the school shooting in Parkland. The FBI confirmed on Thursday that they were made aware of the comment, adding that they had conducted ""checks"" but were unable to identify the person behind it. Meanwhile maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald newspaper that school authorities had emailed teachers about Mr Cruz's behaviour. ""We were told last year that he wasn't allowed on campus with a backpack on him,""Mr Gard told the Miami Herald.,external ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" Updates as they happened Is it time to arm teachers? Florida shooting: A survivor's story It is unclear why Mr Cruz was expelled from the school. Former schoolmate Joshua Charo said Mr Cruz had been found with bullets in his backpack. ""I can't say I was shocked,"" Mr Charo said after the shooting. ""He seemed like the kind of kid who would do something like this."" The school's 3,000 students were almost at the end of their day when the attack broke out Other students echoed that opinion. ""Everyone predicted it,"" one told local station WFOR. But police said they had not been warned of a possible attack by Mr Cruz. US media quote the head of white supremacist group the Republic of Florida Jordan Jereb as saying Mr Cruz had once trained with them, but the group had not wanted or ordered him to carry out a school shooting. However local media later reported thatinvestigators had been unable to find any link between Mr Cruz and the ROF,external. What we know about the suspect Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Mr Cruz's social media profiles were ""very, very disturbing"". Two separate Instagram accounts, now deleted, purport to show Mr Cruz posing with guns and knives. Mr Cruz allegedly used an AR-15 rifle in the attack, which he had reportedly bought legally. This video can not be played Footage posted on social media captures the moment Nikolas Cruz opened fire Details of the 17 victims are emerging. The school's assistant football coachAaron Feiswas taken to hospital after jumping in front of students to shield them from bullets. His team tweeted that he had ""died a hero"".

Cruel paedophile with no remorse,"Barry Bennell, who has been convicted of 43 counts of historical child sex offences, was interviewed dozens of times by police. Those who questioned him say he is a ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" man who failed to show ""one iota"" of remorse. ""The only person that matters to Barry Bennell is Barry Bennell,"" says Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver, who sat through 30 interviews with the convicted paedophile. She is one of 25 detectives who worked on the investigation into Bennell's abuse - which is one of the biggest and most complicated cases in the history of Cheshire Constabulary. Bennell was a ""predatory paedophile"" who preyed upon the dreams of young footballers he was supposed to be coaching, his trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was a child molester on an ""industrial scale"". In his house in the Peak District, he had arcade machines, a pool table, and big TVs. At various times he owned a monkey and a wild cat. It was a ""a kids' paradise"", Bennell once boasted to police. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" During the trial, prosecutors compared him to the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Yet throughout his numerous interviews, Bennell remained ""completely indifferent"" to the suffering he caused, DI Oliver says. He is a ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" man, she adds. Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' Ex-football coach Barry Bennell guilty of further sex abuse When police raided a small bungalow at the top of a quiet cul-de-sac in Milton Keynes in November 2016, the crimes Bennell had committed came as a complete surprise to his neighbours. Bennell had lived in the council-owned bungalow under the name Richard Jones for more than four years, they said, running a small computer repair business. He made extra money by selling items online and at car boot sales, according to one neighbour. He had dogs, all named after Hebridean islands. Bennell's golden retriever Skye was taken by police when they raided his home. Residents had run-ins with him - mainly about people collecting items from his house late at night and taking up parking on the road. He was ""arrogant"" and ""thought he was untouchable,"" one added. His Facebook profile - in the name of Richard Barry - includes photographs of Bennell's visits to theme parks, including Thorpe Park and Alton Towers, to north Wales and a safari park; holidays to Gran Canaria and Derbyshire. Another photo from his past shows him coaching young footballers in the US - a country in which he spent three years in prison for abusing a boy at a holiday camp. Bennell's neighbours knew he was unwell. He was being fed through a tube in his stomach and he lived with a woman, who he claimed was a female carer. When he suddenly vanished for a year in 2015, most assumed he had died. The woman told one neighbour he was staying at a bungalow in Devon. Bennell's golden retriever Skye was led away from his home in Milton Keynes after his arrest in 2016 But Bennell was not in Devon. He was in prison for a third time - his second time behind bars in the UK for child sex offences. ""Then one day I saw him out there,"" a neighbour said pointing towards the street. ""I rang my friend and said 'you'll never guess who has just come back from the dead.'"" Within another year, Bennell had been named by a string of ex-footballers as a serial paedophile and child rapist. He was re-arrested in November 2016 and remanded in prison, where he has been ever since. Before his trial began Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys. His bungalow was boarded up for months after a window was smashed. A family now lives there. Officers had to complete a 300-mile roundtrip from Cheshire to HMP Woodhill, in Milton Keynes, to interview Bennell. ""There was initially a sense from him that he was angry and he didn't really see why he should have to account for what happened all those years ago,"" DI Oliver says. ""He was quite indignant actually."" This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police how he groomed young boys In one interview, Bennell said he remembered one complainant as ""a good looking lad"", but denied he had abused him. ""I remember him because I remember thinking that you know, he was the one, the one who got away..."" he told police. One victim's description of Bennell was put to him - a stocky man with blond permed hair who ""loved himself"". ""I always thought I was brilliant,"" Bennell told officers, adding: ""And it wasn't permed, it was natural."" In another police interview, Bennell denied abusing a boy, suggesting he was too young for his taste. He couldn't have done it, he argued, because he ""aimed"" for 13 year olds. ""That was puberty age and they were becoming a bit more strong-willed and not tied to the apron strings,"" he told police. Throughout questioning, Bennell has been ""utterly indifferent to the fact he has traumatised these boys"", says DI Oliver. ""Not once has he shown one iota of empathy to his victims and what he has put them through."" Andy Woodward attended the trial with his wife Zelda During the trial, at Liverpool Crown Court, Prosecutor Nicholas Johnson QC made a point of reminding the jury that Bennell had married the sister of one of his victims. Andy Woodward, who waived his right to anonymity to speak about being repeatedly abused by Bennell as a young boy, at one stage had to describe his abuser as his brother-in-law. ""Just imagine,"" Mr Johnson urged the jury. ""What does that tell you about his attitude to other people and their expendability to him?"" Bennell did not attend the five-week trial. In his absence, his defence team accused his victims of making allegations in order to get compensation. But those victims, DI Oliver says, were just ""little boys who wanted to play football"". ""When you hear them give their evidence in court they are little boys again and they are waiting for him to say sorry."" They are still waiting.

"My dreams were shattered by Barry BennellFBI was warned about Florida gunmanAuthorities were alerted after Nikolas Cruz said he planned to be ""a professional school shooter"".13m14 minutes agoUS & Canada"," Gary Cliffe was 11 in 1981. He was living south of Manchester and dreaming of FA Cup glory. Manchester City had reached the cup final at Wembley that season, only losing to Spurs after a replay and one of the FA Cup's iconic moments: Argentine midfielder Ricky Villa dribbling his way brilliantly through the City defence and turning the ball past the goalkeeper. Cliffe, though, like his father, was always much more of a United fan. His parents encouraged him to play at an early age. They weren’t pushy, just very supportive. Most weekends were spent jumping into the back of his dad’s battered Chrysler Sunbeam to be dropped off at muddy changing rooms from Nantwich to Crewe. Gary Cliffe Every 11-year-old kid at school wanted to play for City or United. Just a lucky few would ever come close. “Obviously I wanted to make it as a footballer, who wouldn’t?” he told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme. “That was my dream and I almost got there.” Like others, many others, Cliffe’s life was changed forever by a coach he once respected and his parents once trusted. “He was the star-maker, the guy who was going to take me to become a professional footballer,” he says. My childhood was ruined by this man. He's ruined hundreds of lives. I know because I was there.” Gary Cliffe talked to Victoria Derbyshire: This was the era just before the Premier League. Before live football on TV. Before youth development programmes and academies. Professional clubs still recruited young players from local feeder teams linked to adult sides but run at arm’s length by amateur coaches. In this world of dreams and promises one name really stood out. Barry Bennell had a strong reputation. He was a talented coach with a new way of doing things. He was lively, charismatic and good looking. He had a back story to impress as well. Bennell had played briefly for Chelsea’s reserve side before brittle bones, supposedly, forced him to quit. Now he was back where he grew up, running his own chain of video and sports shops in the North West and training youngsters in his spare time. Gary Cliffe By the autumn of 1981, he had just taken over the running of Cliffe’s under 12s side, Pegasus FC, one of a number of clubs he managed linked to Manchester City. Straight away the new coach said he wanted to get to know his young players properly. In pairs they were invited over to his house on the edge of the Peak District for the weekend. Kitted out with the latest gadgets it was what one young player described as an Aladdin’s cave for kids. There were arcade machines, pool tables and an endless supply of free football kit. Bennell had dogs, a wildcat, even a pet monkey. He would turn off the lights and let 10 and 11-year-old children watch adult-rated horror films borrowed from his own video store downstairs. The heating would be turned down so some boys would get closer to him as a precursor to more serious abuse. For Cliffe, there was no build up. No serious attempt to groom him first. It started almost immediately. The touching quickly moved on to forced oral sex and attempted rape. Mostly it took place when he was alone in Bennell’s house or in his car. But there were times, many times, when other children were abused while they were in the same room as each other. “There’d be me on one side, Bennell would be in the middle and the other boy on the other side,” says Gary. “I would know I was being abused, and it’d be naive of anyone to think that the other boy wasn’t. I know they were. I was there. But I couldn’t say anything.” From the age of 11 to 15, it happened to Cliffe over and over again. At weekends, at Christmas time, every school holiday. Hundreds of times. I knew it was wrong but I just didn’t have the stomach or the vocabulary to put my hands up and stop it.” Gary Cliffe “It was happening with other boys around. They weren’t saying anything. I didn’t say anything. No parents were saying anything. No officials at the club were saying anything. “I just didn’t have the words. I was dreaming of being a footballer and the bubble would have burst.” With his confidence and swagger Bennell could also win over parents. Some mothers worked for him from time-to-time in his chain of video shops. Another family invited him around for Christmas dinner because they thought he looked lonely. In Gary’s words Bennell held adults in “the palm of his hand”. They were “in awe of him, taken in by him”. As for young children, his favoured boys would be promised a bright future in the game. If a player resisted or, worse, struck back, they would be humiliated, shunned and dropped from the team. A captain of one of Bennell’s sides told how, after forcing the coach away one night, he was sidelined and stripped of the captaincy. A rumour quickly went round that he was stealing money from his teammates. He never played for the club again. On the pitch there was no doubt Bennell was a gifted football coach, one of the most promising in the North West. His name quickly became linked to one team: Manchester City. He was never a full member of staff at the club but it’s thought he was paid expenses and given his own pass to its Platt Lane training ground. His teams all played in Manchester City strips. “In other words,” claims Cliffe, “He had the run of the place.” “He was producing the teams who won everything. We were the envy of most boys. We’d come back with a trophy most times,” he says. Bennell would go on to coach a generation of City stars from David White to Andy Hinchcliffe, as well as former Leeds United midfielder Gary Speed. White has confirmed he was abused. There is no suggestion Hinchcliffe and Speed were victims. Gary Speed His young teams were winners. The most talented players signed schoolboy forms, the first step towards a career in the professional game. But for those looking closely enough, the warning signs were already there. There were fights with other managers in the youth leagues. Bennell was attacked with a metal peg used to tie down goal nets, leaving him with a deep cut below his eye socket. The parents of one boy complained to Manchester City after their son was kept up late in a hotel room on an away trip. Other members of the playing staff were becoming more suspicious about his behaviour. Former goalkeeper and youth team manager Steve Fleet said he first heard rumours in the late 70s. Steve Fleet At one point Fleet says, he was under pressure from a club official to give Bennell a proper role, to make him an official part of the City line-up. I said it was either him or me. I wasn’t working with a person like that. I’d heard he was doing things with kids that weren’t normal.” On that occasion, he says, he won the argument. After Fleet left the club in 1980, it appears Bennell became more involved, though he never did make it onto the full coaching staff there. His victims from that time, and to date seven have come forward publicly, are convinced more could and should have been done. “They let us down, they didn’t challenge him,” says Cliffe. “They knew what he was and they allowed it to continue because he was producing results.” Other young players abused around that time speak of the same culture of wilful ignorance and neglect. Interviewed by Channel 4 back in 1997, Manchester City officials said they didn’t receive a single formal complaint about Bennell’s behaviour. There was “no evidence whatsoever from that side of the fence”, claimed former chief scout, the late Ken Barnes. Manchester City is now in the middle of its own internal review led by the QC Jane Mulcahy. It will examine if more should have been done to protect young players in the past and look at the club’s current child protection policies. In a statement, the club said: “Manchester City offers its heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured.” “All victims were entitled to expect full protection.” On 30 November 1984 in a short ceremony at Platt Lane, Cliffe finally signed associated schoolboy forms with Manchester City. It was an important milestone. Only the most talented youngsters made it so far. Bennell was alongside him in that room at that moment. There was once a photograph to prove it. His mother found it years later and cut the coach out of the frame. By then aged 14, Cliffe started training with the youth side and was stopped from playing for any other team. But even though he was moving on he could not escape Bennell’s influence and the stigma that went with it. He says he was bullied for his close association with the coach, who was, according to other staff members, by then the subject of raised eyebrows and knowing looks at the club. Cliffe says another coach, again not directly employed by Manchester City, would often laugh about it, calling him Bennell’s “bum boy” in front of his teenage teammates. He says that finished him off. “He used those words and the other boys didn’t say anything but they knew,” says Cliffe. “Not only had I had it physically off Bennell but now this other coach who was supposed to take me through to 16 - the crucial time when you get signed on. “He had the audacity to say those words and take the Mick. It was horrific.” Aged 16, Cliffe quit the game. He eventually became a detective with Cheshire Police. Gary Cliffe As for Barry Bennell, his time with Manchester City ended abruptly in 1984. No-one is quite sure why but it’s thought he was, once again, turned down for a full-time coaching position. With his options limited, his attention simply switched from one club in North West England to another. Just an hour’s drive south of Manchester is the old railway town of Crewe. In the world of football the two places could not be much further apart. In 1984 Crewe Alexandra were struggling in the old fourth division, the lowest tier in the football league. The club had just appointed a promising young manager, Dario Gradi, who knew Barry Bennell from his time as a coach at Chelsea. His old contact was brought in to help modernise the youth set up. Over the next decade Crewe consistently produced young players who would later be sold on for good money to top flight clubs. Its academy became one of the most respected in the game. England internationals Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Seth Johnson all came through there. David Platt joined as a 19-year-old and left three years later to become one of the country’s brightest stars. Its youth system was so successful it was soon known by a different name: The Football Factory. After years of trying, Barry Bennell was finally on a professional club’s payroll, officially responsible for development and scouting. One of the first players he spotted was a promising 11-year-old playing for Stockport Boys. His name was Andy Woodward. Andy Woodward The pattern of abuse was horribly familiar. “Within about three or four weeks he asked my parents if I could go and stay at his address. It started there,” Woodward says. Initially it was sexual touching but then it got worse. He raped me. I don’t want to put a number on how many times, but it was over a four-year period.” Like other victims, Woodward, an outgoing young boy, quickly became introverted and withdrawn. Bennell appeared to target the quieter, more thoughtful players, threatening to rip up their dreams if they ever stepped out of line or spoke up. “It was that control,” says Woodward. “All I wanted to do was be a footballer. But he threatened to take that away from me.” “I was crying out for somebody at the club, at Crewe, to say it’s wrong. But that didn’t happen.” Andy Woodward Woodward was far from the only victim linked to Crewe Alexandra. To date another five players have come forward, in public, to say they were abused in the same way. Bennell’s crimes took place not just at his house in Cheshire. A court later heard it also happened on one of Crewe’s training pitches and at the home of manager Gradi, himself, though he knew nothing about it. Again with Crewe’s football factory churning out so much talent, it appears few wanted to ask too many questions about Bennell’s treatment of the children in his care. At one point Bennell became so important to the club’s success, that one source says Gradi asked to split his share of sell-on fees with his youth coach. Gradi, by then a club director, had struck a deal with the board to receive 10 percent of any payment if one of the team’s young players was sold to another side. He asked the board for this to be cut to seven percent, with the other three percent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director.

He asked the board for this to be cut to seven per cent, with the other three per cent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director. Throughout the 1980s, there is no evidence that a single complaint was ever made to either the police or Crewe Alexandra itself. Again, though, there were plenty of rumours about Bennell’s behaviour. A senior member of the backroom staff at Crewe was said to have refused to allow their own children to be trained by the coach. There was talk that Sir Alex Ferguson personally asked security guards to escort Bennell off Manchester United’s training ground at Littleton Road. Sir Alex says he cannot recall the incident happening. The mother of a young Crewe player said she sent an anonymous letter to Gradi, when he was manager, to complain about boys sharing hotel beds with Bennell on away trips. No allegation of sexual abuse was made at the time and it’s not clear if the letter, which she remembers writing in 1989 or 1990, was ever opened by Gradi or Crewe. Perhaps the strongest warning, though, is said to have come from one of the most senior officials at the club, former managing director Hamilton Smith. Hamilton Smith After hearing rumours of inappropriate behaviour and a second-hand allegation of abuse from an anonymous parent, he says he changed the agenda of a board meeting to deal directly with concerns about the youth coach. “I thought no this is no good. I’ve had it right up to here. It’s got to stop,” he said. “I got back home and I rang the then vice-chairman John Bowler and told him what had happened,” said Smith. “I said, ‘This is hot. We’ve got to address it.’” During the board meeting, held at the house of then-chairman Norman Rowlinson, a senior police source was called who suggested Bennell should be moved on. By this time though Barry Bennell was a full-time employee at Crewe and there was no direct complaint from a parent. Instead Smith says the club directors present decided John Bowler, now Crewe Alexandra’s chairman, should raise only more general concerns with manager Dario Gradi about Barry Bennell letting children stay overnight in his house. Smith described Mr Gradi’s response as “very angry”. At a follow-up meeting the manager made it clear he did not have a problem with Bennell and the coach was allowed to continue working at Crewe Alexandra. “It makes me furious when [Crewe Alexandra FC] say they didn’t know something was going on,” says Hamilton Smith. “Everybody involved could and should have done a lot more.” Dario Gradi In a 1997 interview Dario Gradi said the club had no cause for any concern when Bennell was working at Crewe. He later said the first he or anyone else at the club knew of any crimes was when Bennell was finally arrested in 1994. Now Crewe’s director of football, Gradi has had his coaching licence suspended by the Football Association while it carries out a wider inquiry into abuse allegations and how they’ve been handled across football. In a statement following the guilty verdicts against Bennell, Crewe Alexandra FC expressed its deepest sympathies for his victims - and reiterated that it had not been aware of any sexual abuse by him, either before or during his time with the club. The club also stressed “it would have contacted the police immediately” if it had any suspicion that Bennell was committing acts of abuse, “either before, during or after he left the club’s employment”. Cheshire police say that during the course of their inquiry Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and the FA were “nothing but cooperative”. They say they could find no evidence of a conspiracy to cover up allegations of abuse. Andy Woodward worked through the ranks at Crewe Alexandra, making his first-team debut in 1992 at the age of 19. Three years later he signed for Bury, playing 24 times in his first full season as the Lancashire club won the division two title. Then out of nowhere he was shopping at Tesco’s one Sunday night, when he broke down, almost collapsed and was taken to hospital. “I went through the door and all of a sudden this rush of adrenaline went through my body,” he says. “I wouldn’t wish that feeling on anyone. It was the scariest thing that had happened in my life.” He started to suffer from repeated panic attacks while playing, covering them up by claiming he was injured - inventing a twisted ankle or problem hamstring. Andy Woodward His career faded out, ending at the age of 29 after short spells with Sheffield United, Scunthorpe and Halifax. “In my head there were all sorts of things going on. I don’t know how I even played,” he says. “I can’t put into words what was done to me. But I think other people out there will understand. I think we survive and that’s it. We just survive.” As with Manchester City, the reasons why Bennell finally left Crewe Alexandra are unclear. People say he was sacked quietly in 1991 after a dispute over tactics. He was soon back coaching at a small local team in the Cheshire area, Stone Dominoes, where he took young boys overseas to training camps in Jacksonville, Florida. It was there in the summer of 1992 that his long history of abuse finally caught up with him. Bennell sexually assaulted a 13-year-old British boy in a hotel room. Only this time the child, who has never been named, told his parents partly because he said he was terrified of catching Aids. Bennell was arrested by police in the US and eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery of a child. He spent three years in an American prison. The US authorities suspected this wasn’t the first time he had abused young boys. Libby Senterfitt from the State Attorney’s office in Florida wrote a strong warning letter to Fifa’s head office in Switzerland and to the Football Association. Cheshire Police was alerted and started investigating possible crimes in the UK. With Bennell serving time in prison, the subject was tackled by the national media for the first time. In January 1997 investigative journalist Deborah Davis presented Soccer’s Foul Play, an hour-long documentary for Channel 4. It named Bennell and other alleged abusers in the game, giving a voice to victims for the first time and asking tough questions of club officials. But the Football Association reacted defensively and the response from the rest of the media was muted. One television critic dismissed the programme as alarmist, savaging it for “charging around, looking for somewhere to bang in its nails”. A year later, in 1998, Bennell was deported from the US and flown back to the UK. Barry Bennell He was arrested as he landed and later admitted 23 charges of sexual abuse against six British boys aged nine to 15, changing his plea to guilty just a day before trial. One of those boys was Andy Woodward. “When he was jailed I just felt safe he was in prison,” he says. “His sentence was nine years. Looking back now, nine years for just what happened to me was not enough.” “I can’t put into words what it has done to me. The impact it had on my life was just catastrophic.” After Bennell’s release he was convicted once again for historical offences against yet another schoolboy back in the late 1970s. At trial his own barrister described him as a monster. But all this news was covered only briefly in a handful of local press articles. There was no huge scandal, no major police investigation, certainly no FA inquiry or soul searching from the clubs involved. That took another decade. In November 2016 Woodward made the decision to speak publicly about the abuse and the impact on his life. He told his story to the Guardian newspaper and the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire Programme. His testimony, sitting first on his own, then alongside a group of other survivors on national television, started something unexpected as victim after victim came forward. At the last count police forces across the country had identified 294 alleged suspects in cases involving 839 possible victims linked to football. Steve Walters talked to Victoria Derbyshire: The chairman of the FA, Greg Clarke, has called it the biggest scandal facing the game. Gary Cliffe was at work that day, checking Twitter on his phone as Andy Woodward sat in a TV studio in London alongside Steve Walters, Jason Dunford and Chris Unsworth. All four footballers were victims of Bennell, though Jason Dunford had fought him off and wasn’t sexually abused. As the updates came in, Cliffe decided he couldn’t concentrate on work. He got in his car, pulled over and watched the interview back on his phone sitting at the side of the road. “They all spoke with such dignity,” he says. “Reassurance is the wrong word but you got the idea that others are there with you and you take comfort from that. That’s what I felt.” But Cliffe couldn’t add his voice publicly at the time. By coincidence months earlier he had already contacted the police about Bennell and wanted to press charges. Barry Bennell An investigation had started and he had been asked not to speak out in the media while detectives were working on the case. This wasn’t the first time Cliffe had been in contact with the authorities. He gave a police statement in 1995 when Bennell was eventually convicted on other charges. At the same time he told his parents what had happened. Back then though he didn’t feel strong enough to take the case to court, with the possibility he might have to give evidence in front of his abuser. Now, in his mid-40s, his feelings had changed. “You get to the stage where you get older and you think, do you know what, I don’t want to have any regrets,” he says. “So I picked up that phone and made that call.” Barry Bennell So did others. After Woodward spoke out more players came forward with their accounts of what happened decades ago. Bennell was charged with another 55 counts of sexual abuse - which took place between 1979 and 1991. On 15 February 2018, after a six-week long trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted once again. He was found guilty of 43 counts of child sex abuse against another 11 boys. “My childhood was wrecked. He’s damaged me, there’s no doubt about it. I’ve been on medication for many years now, probably will be for the rest of my life,” says Cliffe. Built with Shorthand"

Justice has been served - Bennell victimsEx-footballers speak after their former coach is convicted of 43 sex assaults on 11 boys.28m28 minutes agoUKMy dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell,"This video can not be played February 2018: Chris Unsworth, Micky Fallon and Steven Walters Three of Barry Bennell's victims have told how he turned their dreams into a ""horrendous nightmare"" after the former youth football coach was convicted of 43 sex assaults on boys. Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was found guilty of abusing 11 boys aged eight to 15. Speaking outside Liverpool Crown Court, another victim, Andy Woodward, said ""justice has been served"". It is understood 86 others have come forward to say they were victims. The jury, which deliberated over five days, had been told of Bennell's abuse of 12 boys between 1979 and 1990. Before the case he admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys, two of whom were also part of the allegations he was tried on. 'My dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell' A cruel paedophile who showed no remorse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' He was found guilty of 36 charges on Tuesday, and a further seven counts on Thursday. Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, appeared in court via videolink during the five-week trial due to illness. He could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were returned by a 10-1 majority. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" He will be sentenced on Monday and will be produced from custody to attend the hearing. It was the fourth time Bennell had been convicted of abusing boys. The jury was told he hadpreviously received jail sentences in the UK and in the USin 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest police investigation began in November 2016 when Andy Woodward gave interviews about his experiences to the Guardian and BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Speaking outside court after the verdict, the ex-Crewe defender said: ""Justice has been served today and people will be able to move on with their lives including myself."" This video can not be played Andy Woodward says 'justice has been served' Mr Woodward said he believed ""the football clubs that were accountable for this... could have stopped this for so many years... And I think now's the time that that comes sort of out. ""And I would personally like after 15 months, an apology from Crewe Alexandra for what happened to us boys."" Ex-Manchester City youth player Chris Unsworth, who was abused by Bennell when he was a scout at the club, stood alongside Micky Fallon and Steve Walters as he read a statement. The three men are supporters of the Offside Trust, which was set up by ex-professional players to support abuse survivors. Mr Unsworth said: ""We stand before you today as men united in justice, but this is about so much more than us."" Mr Fallon, who was targeted by Bennell at Crewe, said: ""We stand before you today as men united but, at the same time, we were very young boys. We were little boys with a dream and our innocence was shattered. Our dreams turned into the most horrendous nightmare."" Bary Bennell could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were announed Prosecutors described Bennell as a ""predatory paedophile"" who abused boys on an ""industrial scale"". They told the trial he had a ""power hold"" over the aspiring professional players. Boys were abused at his home - including a property in Derbyshire where he had arcade games and a puma and a monkey - on trips away, and in his car on the way to and from training, they said. Det Insp Sarah Oliver, who led the investigation, said Bennell had betrayed the trust of the young players. ""As a football coach he should have provided nothing more than safety and support for the players in his care,"" she said. ""Instead he abused them. He also abused the trust of their families who had placed them into that care so they could pursue their dreams of being professional footballers. He has shattered those dreams and left them burdened for decades."" In a statement, Crewe Alexandra expressed its ""deepest sympathies"" to Bennell's victims and said it worked closely with the police investigation. It added it was was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell or had received any complaint before or during his employment with the club. Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Manchester City offered ""heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured"". The club said it was keen to speak to any survivor or witness to sexual abuse which might be connected to Manchester City or which could support a review it launched after the latest allegations were raised in 2016. It added its review also identified serious allegations of child sex abuse in respect of a second man with ""potential historic connections to the club"". The man is now dead and is not believed to be linked to Bennell.

My dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell," Gary Cliffe was 11 in 1981. He was living south of Manchester and dreaming of FA Cup glory. Manchester City had reached the cup final at Wembley that season, only losing to Spurs after a replay and one of the FA Cup's iconic moments: Argentine midfielder Ricky Villa dribbling his way brilliantly through the City defence and turning the ball past the goalkeeper. Cliffe, though, like his father, was always much more of a United fan. His parents encouraged him to play at an early age. They weren’t pushy, just very supportive. Most weekends were spent jumping into the back of his dad’s battered Chrysler Sunbeam to be dropped off at muddy changing rooms from Nantwich to Crewe. Gary Cliffe Every 11-year-old kid at school wanted to play for City or United. Just a lucky few would ever come close. “Obviously I wanted to make it as a footballer, who wouldn’t?” he told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme. “That was my dream and I almost got there.” Like others, many others, Cliffe’s life was changed forever by a coach he once respected and his parents once trusted. “He was the star-maker, the guy who was going to take me to become a professional footballer,” he says. My childhood was ruined by this man. He's ruined hundreds of lives. I know because I was there.” Gary Cliffe talked to Victoria Derbyshire: This was the era just before the Premier League. Before live football on TV. Before youth development programmes and academies. Professional clubs still recruited young players from local feeder teams linked to adult sides but run at arm’s length by amateur coaches. In this world of dreams and promises one name really stood out. Barry Bennell had a strong reputation. He was a talented coach with a new way of doing things. He was lively, charismatic and good looking. He had a back story to impress as well. Bennell had played briefly for Chelsea’s reserve side before brittle bones, supposedly, forced him to quit. Now he was back where he grew up, running his own chain of video and sports shops in the North West and training youngsters in his spare time. Gary Cliffe By the autumn of 1981, he had just taken over the running of Cliffe’s under 12s side, Pegasus FC, one of a number of clubs he managed linked to Manchester City. Straight away the new coach said he wanted to get to know his young players properly. In pairs they were invited over to his house on the edge of the Peak District for the weekend. Kitted out with the latest gadgets it was what one young player described as an Aladdin’s cave for kids. There were arcade machines, pool tables and an endless supply of free football kit. Bennell had dogs, a wildcat, even a pet monkey. He would turn off the lights and let 10 and 11-year-old children watch adult-rated horror films borrowed from his own video store downstairs. The heating would be turned down so some boys would get closer to him as a precursor to more serious abuse. For Cliffe, there was no build up. No serious attempt to groom him first. It started almost immediately. The touching quickly moved on to forced oral sex and attempted rape. Mostly it took place when he was alone in Bennell’s house or in his car. But there were times, many times, when other children were abused while they were in the same room as each other. “There’d be me on one side, Bennell would be in the middle and the other boy on the other side,” says Gary. “I would know I was being abused, and it’d be naive of anyone to think that the other boy wasn’t. I know they were. I was there. But I couldn’t say anything.” From the age of 11 to 15, it happened to Cliffe over and over again. At weekends, at Christmas time, every school holiday. Hundreds of times. I knew it was wrong but I just didn’t have the stomach or the vocabulary to put my hands up and stop it.” Gary Cliffe “It was happening with other boys around. They weren’t saying anything. I didn’t say anything. No parents were saying anything. No officials at the club were saying anything. “I just didn’t have the words. I was dreaming of being a footballer and the bubble would have burst.” With his confidence and swagger Bennell could also win over parents. Some mothers worked for him from time-to-time in his chain of video shops. Another family invited him around for Christmas dinner because they thought he looked lonely. In Gary’s words Bennell held adults in “the palm of his hand”. They were “in awe of him, taken in by him”. As for young children, his favoured boys would be promised a bright future in the game. If a player resisted or, worse, struck back, they would be humiliated, shunned and dropped from the team. A captain of one of Bennell’s sides told how, after forcing the coach away one night, he was sidelined and stripped of the captaincy. A rumour quickly went round that he was stealing money from his teammates. He never played for the club again. On the pitch there was no doubt Bennell was a gifted football coach, one of the most promising in the North West. His name quickly became linked to one team: Manchester City. He was never a full member of staff at the club but it’s thought he was paid expenses and given his own pass to its Platt Lane training ground. His teams all played in Manchester City strips. “In other words,” claims Cliffe, “He had the run of the place.” “He was producing the teams who won everything. We were the envy of most boys. We’d come back with a trophy most times,” he says. Bennell would go on to coach a generation of City stars from David White to Andy Hinchcliffe, as well as former Leeds United midfielder Gary Speed. White has confirmed he was abused. There is no suggestion Hinchcliffe and Speed were victims. Gary Speed His young teams were winners. The most talented players signed schoolboy forms, the first step towards a career in the professional game. But for those looking closely enough, the warning signs were already there. There were fights with other managers in the youth leagues. Bennell was attacked with a metal peg used to tie down goal nets, leaving him with a deep cut below his eye socket. The parents of one boy complained to Manchester City after their son was kept up late in a hotel room on an away trip. Other members of the playing staff were becoming more suspicious about his behaviour. Former goalkeeper and youth team manager Steve Fleet said he first heard rumours in the late 70s. Steve Fleet At one point Fleet says, he was under pressure from a club official to give Bennell a proper role, to make him an official part of the City line-up. I said it was either him or me. I wasn’t working with a person like that. I’d heard he was doing things with kids that weren’t normal.” On that occasion, he says, he won the argument. After Fleet left the club in 1980, it appears Bennell became more involved, though he never did make it onto the full coaching staff there. His victims from that time, and to date seven have come forward publicly, are convinced more could and should have been done. “They let us down, they didn’t challenge him,” says Cliffe. “They knew what he was and they allowed it to continue because he was producing results.” Other young players abused around that time speak of the same culture of wilful ignorance and neglect. Interviewed by Channel 4 back in 1997, Manchester City officials said they didn’t receive a single formal complaint about Bennell’s behaviour. There was “no evidence whatsoever from that side of the fence”, claimed former chief scout, the late Ken Barnes. Manchester City is now in the middle of its own internal review led by the QC Jane Mulcahy. It will examine if more should have been done to protect young players in the past and look at the club’s current child protection policies. In a statement, the club said: “Manchester City offers its heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured.” “All victims were entitled to expect full protection.” On 30 November 1984 in a short ceremony at Platt Lane, Cliffe finally signed associated schoolboy forms with Manchester City. It was an important milestone. Only the most talented youngsters made it so far. Bennell was alongside him in that room at that moment. There was once a photograph to prove it. His mother found it years later and cut the coach out of the frame. By then aged 14, Cliffe started training with the youth side and was stopped from playing for any other team. But even though he was moving on he could not escape Bennell’s influence and the stigma that went with it. He says he was bullied for his close association with the coach, who was, according to other staff members, by then the subject of raised eyebrows and knowing looks at the club. Cliffe says another coach, again not directly employed by Manchester City, would often laugh about it, calling him Bennell’s “bum boy” in front of his teenage teammates. He says that finished him off. “He used those words and the other boys didn’t say anything but they knew,” says Cliffe. “Not only had I had it physically off Bennell but now this other coach who was supposed to take me through to 16 - the crucial time when you get signed on. “He had the audacity to say those words and take the Mick. It was horrific.” Aged 16, Cliffe quit the game. He eventually became a detective with Cheshire Police. Gary Cliffe As for Barry Bennell, his time with Manchester City ended abruptly in 1984. No-one is quite sure why but it’s thought he was, once again, turned down for a full-time coaching position. With his options limited, his attention simply switched from one club in North West England to another. Just an hour’s drive south of Manchester is the old railway town of Crewe. In the world of football the two places could not be much further apart. In 1984 Crewe Alexandra were struggling in the old fourth division, the lowest tier in the football league. The club had just appointed a promising young manager, Dario Gradi, who knew Barry Bennell from his time as a coach at Chelsea. His old contact was brought in to help modernise the youth set up. Over the next decade Crewe consistently produced young players who would later be sold on for good money to top flight clubs. Its academy became one of the most respected in the game. England internationals Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Seth Johnson all came through there. David Platt joined as a 19-year-old and left three years later to become one of the country’s brightest stars. Its youth system was so successful it was soon known by a different name: The Football Factory. After years of trying, Barry Bennell was finally on a professional club’s payroll, officially responsible for development and scouting. One of the first players he spotted was a promising 11-year-old playing for Stockport Boys. His name was Andy Woodward. Andy Woodward The pattern of abuse was horribly familiar. “Within about three or four weeks he asked my parents if I could go and stay at his address. It started there,” Woodward says. Initially it was sexual touching but then it got worse. He raped me. I don’t want to put a number on how many times, but it was over a four-year period.” Like other victims, Woodward, an outgoing young boy, quickly became introverted and withdrawn. Bennell appeared to target the quieter, more thoughtful players, threatening to rip up their dreams if they ever stepped out of line or spoke up. “It was that control,” says Woodward. “All I wanted to do was be a footballer. But he threatened to take that away from me.” “I was crying out for somebody at the club, at Crewe, to say it’s wrong. But that didn’t happen.” Andy Woodward Woodward was far from the only victim linked to Crewe Alexandra. To date another five players have come forward, in public, to say they were abused in the same way. Bennell’s crimes took place not just at his house in Cheshire. A court later heard it also happened on one of Crewe’s training pitches and at the home of manager Gradi, himself, though he knew nothing about it. Again with Crewe’s football factory churning out so much talent, it appears few wanted to ask too many questions about Bennell’s treatment of the children in his care. At one point Bennell became so important to the club’s success, that one source says Gradi asked to split his share of sell-on fees with his youth coach. Gradi, by then a club director, had struck a deal with the board to receive 10 percent of any payment if one of the team’s young players was sold to another side. He asked the board for this to be cut to seven percent, with the other three percent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director.

He asked the board for this to be cut to seven per cent, with the other three per cent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director. Throughout the 1980s, there is no evidence that a single complaint was ever made to either the police or Crewe Alexandra itself. Again, though, there were plenty of rumours about Bennell’s behaviour. A senior member of the backroom staff at Crewe was said to have refused to allow their own children to be trained by the coach. There was talk that Sir Alex Ferguson personally asked security guards to escort Bennell off Manchester United’s training ground at Littleton Road. Sir Alex says he cannot recall the incident happening. The mother of a young Crewe player said she sent an anonymous letter to Gradi, when he was manager, to complain about boys sharing hotel beds with Bennell on away trips. No allegation of sexual abuse was made at the time and it’s not clear if the letter, which she remembers writing in 1989 or 1990, was ever opened by Gradi or Crewe. Perhaps the strongest warning, though, is said to have come from one of the most senior officials at the club, former managing director Hamilton Smith. Hamilton Smith After hearing rumours of inappropriate behaviour and a second-hand allegation of abuse from an anonymous parent, he says he changed the agenda of a board meeting to deal directly with concerns about the youth coach. “I thought no this is no good. I’ve had it right up to here. It’s got to stop,” he said. “I got back home and I rang the then vice-chairman John Bowler and told him what had happened,” said Smith. “I said, ‘This is hot. We’ve got to address it.’” During the board meeting, held at the house of then-chairman Norman Rowlinson, a senior police source was called who suggested Bennell should be moved on. By this time though Barry Bennell was a full-time employee at Crewe and there was no direct complaint from a parent. Instead Smith says the club directors present decided John Bowler, now Crewe Alexandra’s chairman, should raise only more general concerns with manager Dario Gradi about Barry Bennell letting children stay overnight in his house. Smith described Mr Gradi’s response as “very angry”. At a follow-up meeting the manager made it clear he did not have a problem with Bennell and the coach was allowed to continue working at Crewe Alexandra. “It makes me furious when [Crewe Alexandra FC] say they didn’t know something was going on,” says Hamilton Smith. “Everybody involved could and should have done a lot more.” Dario Gradi In a 1997 interview Dario Gradi said the club had no cause for any concern when Bennell was working at Crewe. He later said the first he or anyone else at the club knew of any crimes was when Bennell was finally arrested in 1994. Now Crewe’s director of football, Gradi has had his coaching licence suspended by the Football Association while it carries out a wider inquiry into abuse allegations and how they’ve been handled across football. In a statement following the guilty verdicts against Bennell, Crewe Alexandra FC expressed its deepest sympathies for his victims - and reiterated that it had not been aware of any sexual abuse by him, either before or during his time with the club. The club also stressed “it would have contacted the police immediately” if it had any suspicion that Bennell was committing acts of abuse, “either before, during or after he left the club’s employment”. Cheshire police say that during the course of their inquiry Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and the FA were “nothing but cooperative”. They say they could find no evidence of a conspiracy to cover up allegations of abuse. Andy Woodward worked through the ranks at Crewe Alexandra, making his first-team debut in 1992 at the age of 19. Three years later he signed for Bury, playing 24 times in his first full season as the Lancashire club won the division two title. Then out of nowhere he was shopping at Tesco’s one Sunday night, when he broke down, almost collapsed and was taken to hospital. “I went through the door and all of a sudden this rush of adrenaline went through my body,” he says. “I wouldn’t wish that feeling on anyone. It was the scariest thing that had happened in my life.” He started to suffer from repeated panic attacks while playing, covering them up by claiming he was injured - inventing a twisted ankle or problem hamstring. Andy Woodward His career faded out, ending at the age of 29 after short spells with Sheffield United, Scunthorpe and Halifax. “In my head there were all sorts of things going on. I don’t know how I even played,” he says. “I can’t put into words what was done to me. But I think other people out there will understand. I think we survive and that’s it. We just survive.” As with Manchester City, the reasons why Bennell finally left Crewe Alexandra are unclear. People say he was sacked quietly in 1991 after a dispute over tactics. He was soon back coaching at a small local team in the Cheshire area, Stone Dominoes, where he took young boys overseas to training camps in Jacksonville, Florida. It was there in the summer of 1992 that his long history of abuse finally caught up with him. Bennell sexually assaulted a 13-year-old British boy in a hotel room. Only this time the child, who has never been named, told his parents partly because he said he was terrified of catching Aids. Bennell was arrested by police in the US and eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery of a child. He spent three years in an American prison. The US authorities suspected this wasn’t the first time he had abused young boys. Libby Senterfitt from the State Attorney’s office in Florida wrote a strong warning letter to Fifa’s head office in Switzerland and to the Football Association. Cheshire Police was alerted and started investigating possible crimes in the UK. With Bennell serving time in prison, the subject was tackled by the national media for the first time. In January 1997 investigative journalist Deborah Davis presented Soccer’s Foul Play, an hour-long documentary for Channel 4. It named Bennell and other alleged abusers in the game, giving a voice to victims for the first time and asking tough questions of club officials. But the Football Association reacted defensively and the response from the rest of the media was muted. One television critic dismissed the programme as alarmist, savaging it for “charging around, looking for somewhere to bang in its nails”. A year later, in 1998, Bennell was deported from the US and flown back to the UK. Barry Bennell He was arrested as he landed and later admitted 23 charges of sexual abuse against six British boys aged nine to 15, changing his plea to guilty just a day before trial. One of those boys was Andy Woodward. “When he was jailed I just felt safe he was in prison,” he says. “His sentence was nine years. Looking back now, nine years for just what happened to me was not enough.” “I can’t put into words what it has done to me. The impact it had on my life was just catastrophic.” After Bennell’s release he was convicted once again for historical offences against yet another schoolboy back in the late 1970s. At trial his own barrister described him as a monster. But all this news was covered only briefly in a handful of local press articles. There was no huge scandal, no major police investigation, certainly no FA inquiry or soul searching from the clubs involved. That took another decade. In November 2016 Woodward made the decision to speak publicly about the abuse and the impact on his life. He told his story to the Guardian newspaper and the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire Programme. His testimony, sitting first on his own, then alongside a group of other survivors on national television, started something unexpected as victim after victim came forward. At the last count police forces across the country had identified 294 alleged suspects in cases involving 839 possible victims linked to football. Steve Walters talked to Victoria Derbyshire: The chairman of the FA, Greg Clarke, has called it the biggest scandal facing the game. Gary Cliffe was at work that day, checking Twitter on his phone as Andy Woodward sat in a TV studio in London alongside Steve Walters, Jason Dunford and Chris Unsworth. All four footballers were victims of Bennell, though Jason Dunford had fought him off and wasn’t sexually abused. As the updates came in, Cliffe decided he couldn’t concentrate on work. He got in his car, pulled over and watched the interview back on his phone sitting at the side of the road. “They all spoke with such dignity,” he says. “Reassurance is the wrong word but you got the idea that others are there with you and you take comfort from that. That’s what I felt.” But Cliffe couldn’t add his voice publicly at the time. By coincidence months earlier he had already contacted the police about Bennell and wanted to press charges. Barry Bennell An investigation had started and he had been asked not to speak out in the media while detectives were working on the case. This wasn’t the first time Cliffe had been in contact with the authorities. He gave a police statement in 1995 when Bennell was eventually convicted on other charges. At the same time he told his parents what had happened. Back then though he didn’t feel strong enough to take the case to court, with the possibility he might have to give evidence in front of his abuser. Now, in his mid-40s, his feelings had changed. “You get to the stage where you get older and you think, do you know what, I don’t want to have any regrets,” he says. “So I picked up that phone and made that call.” Barry Bennell So did others. After Woodward spoke out more players came forward with their accounts of what happened decades ago. Bennell was charged with another 55 counts of sexual abuse - which took place between 1979 and 1991. On 15 February 2018, after a six-week long trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted once again. He was found guilty of 43 counts of child sex abuse against another 11 boys. “My childhood was wrecked. He’s damaged me, there’s no doubt about it. I’ve been on medication for many years now, probably will be for the rest of my life,” says Cliffe. Built with Shorthand"
Diet pill overdose death 'huge mistake',"This video can not be played Doug Shipsey has challenged the government over his daughter's death The parents of a woman who overdosed on diet pills have rejected a coroner's finding of suicide. Beth Shipsey, 21, died after taking pills containing highly-toxic DNP in 2017. Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams concluded Ms Shipsey intended to take her own life and would have diedregardless of medical failings. But her father Doug said her death ""was a miscalculation, a huge mistake. It was another cry for help"". Midlands Live: Men 'stabbed in neck with Biro'; pollution probe after many fish found dead The inquest, which concluded on Wednesday, heard how Ms Shipsey had ongoing treatment for mental health issues, but was ""not considered a suicide risk"", despite previously taking 14 overdoses. She was on home leave from a psychiatric unit on the day she died. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire show on the anniversary of their daughter's death, Carole and Doug Shipsey said they were ""disappointed in the verdict"" of suicide. ""There's so much evidence that wasn't the case,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""There was no suicide note, no social media messages she left. ""That would indicate she meant to be found and taken to hospital and treated."" Ms Shipsey had taken 14 overdoses previously, her inquest heard Coroner Mr Williams also spoke of ""serious failures"" in Ms Shipsey's care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. But they ""became irrelevant"" as ""evidence suggests she would have died anyway"", he said. Mrs Shipsey disagreed and said she believed her daughter would have survived if she had received care earlier. ""People have survived with a higher level [of DNP in their blood] that have had supportive care,"" she said. ""Beth had no care in the four-and-a-half hours she was there."" Mrs Shipsey said she was not aware of the ""potency and toxicity"" of the diet pills her daughter was ordering online. She encouraged others to be ""aware"" and ""proactive"" about the dangers of DNP. ""We don't want people to think there's a safe therapeutic dose,"" Mrs Shipsey said. ""An envelope coming through the door with pills in it could be a killer,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""As turned out to be the case with Beth."" The pills taken by Ms Shipsey have ""no known antidote"" After the inquest, the trust in charge of the hospital apologised after there were found to have been ""significant failings"" in Ms Shipsey's care.

In an open letter to Belgian media (in Dutch),Mr Van Hauwermeiren said he had resigned for failing to control rumours about sex scandals,externalinvolving Oxfam in Haiti and for ""feeding the rumours"" through his own relationship with a Haitian woman. ""In early 2011, I had to dismiss two internationals because of clear indications (no witnesses) of prostitutes who had been lured to their rooms... ""I was nicknamed 'the terminator' as I acted so severely in this case."" Mr Van Hauwermeiren was Oxfam's country director in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake He said he had never visited a brothel or nightclub in Haiti and audits had ""never shown that funds were used to finance excesses or sex parties"". Referring to the two staff dismissals, and some other resignations ""because of serious suspicions"", he said ""reporting in the media is almost correct"". ""I'm not a saint, I'm a man of flesh and blood and have made mistakes (not easy to admit), and I am deeply ashamed,"" he said. Haitian Oxfam workers tried to warn of sex scandal before Oxfam worker rehired after being dismissed Mr Van Hauwermeiren has also been accused of using prostitutes while working for British health charity Merlin in Liberia from 2002-04, according toa former colleague who spoke to the IRIN website.,external Merlin later merged with Save the Children, which says it does not have access to Merlin's records. According to Mr Van Hauwermeiren, he and two colleagues in Liberia were dismissed after mixing with two women who ""turned out to be prostitutes"". He said he had just ""danced and flirted with them"". He was then hired by Oxfam as a country director in Chad. Under his leadership there, in 2006,staff used prostitutes in the charity's premises,,externalaccording to UK newspaper Observer, claims that Oxfam said it could not corroborate. Mr Van Hauwermeiren denied the allegation as ""nonsense"", saying the few ladies who attended aid groups' parties in Chad were staff members. From Chad he moved to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti. UN aid agencies fear backlash How will scandal affect Oxfam? After he resigned his Oxfam post in Haiti, Mr Van Hauwermeiren ended up taking another high-profile position, as the head of mission for Action Against Hunger in Bangladesh. Earlier,in an interview with the Belgian newspaper De Standaard,external(in Dutch) from his apartment on the Belgian coast, he said it ""was especially bad"" that his family did not want to see him anymore as a result of the allegations. In the wake of the scandal, Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned.

Airbus takes new hit on military plane,"Airbus has written off another â¬1.3bn (Â£1.2bn) on its troubled A400M military transport plane, bringing total losses on the project to more than â¬8bn. The A400M has had setbacks over the years, most seriously a crash during a test flight in Spain in 2015 which led to the deaths of the four crew members. The aerospace group reported better-than-expected 2017 profits of â¬4.3bn, against â¬3.9bn in 2016. Shares in the company were up 10% by Thursday's close. Revenues were ""stable"" at â¬66.8bn, up from â¬66.6bn. In its statement, Airbus said higher aircraft deliveries had been ""offset by a reduction in revenues of around â¬2bn from the perimeter changes"". Last week, Airbus reached a provisional agreement with seven European NATO buyer countries over further delays in deliveries for the A400M. Chief executive Tom Enders said in the results statement: ""On A400M, we made progress on the industrial and capabilities front and agreed a re-baselining with government customers which will significantly reduce the remaining programme risks. This is reflected in a substantial one-off charge."" Emirates placed an order last month for up to 36 new A380s Airbus said it expected to deliver about 800 commercial aircraft in 2018 if engine manufacturers met their commitments. If it does hit those delivery targets, it said it would see profits increase by about 20% this year. The company said it had ""continued the production ramp-up"" of the A320neo commercial plane - an upgraded version of the medium-haul A320 jet with more fuel-efficient engines. It ""finally delivered"" a record 181 aircraft last year ""despite persistent engine issues"", said Mr Enders. The ""engine issues"" include delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney and CFM International. ""The A320neo ramp-up remains challenging and requires that the engine suppliers deliver in line with commitments,"" Airbus said. Addressing the A320 problems on a conference call, Mr Enders said: ""We have been in permanent crisis management for the last two or three years."" Last month, the Middle Eastern airline Emirates announced an order for up to 36 Airbus A380s. The $16bn (Â£11.5bn) deal amounted to a reprieve for the A380 after Airbus threatened to stop making the jet unless it could strike a deal with Emirates. In its results statement, Airbus said Emirates Airline's latest order provided ""increased visibility on the A380 programme for the years to come"". The A400M was meant to be the flagship of Airbus' military fleet - but the programme has been dogged by seemingly endless delays, technical problems and what the chief executive, Tom Enders, has described as a 'flawed contractual set-up"". As a result, the heavy-lifter has ended up being a financial deadweight on the company. The new write-off of â¬1.3bn takes the total so far to more than â¬8bn. That isn't the only issue causing concern. The company is the subject of ongoing corruption investigations in both the UK and France, over its use of intermediaries in major aircraft deals; it now seems the US authorities are taking an interest as well. With the chief operating officer, Fabrice Bregier, stepping down and the top salesman, John Leahy, retiring, the company is already in a state of management flux - and Tom Enders is also due to leave next year. But, on the plus side, Airbus's order book is still full to bursting. It has even managed to log a new order for the troubled A380 superjumbo, enough to keep the production line going for another decade. And profits are rising. So it isn't all bad news - far from it.

Dad jailed for hammer attack on children,"As a result of Scott's actions, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life A man has been jailed for life for trying to kill his three children and step-daughter by hitting them with a hammer then crashing a car into a wall. Owen Scott, 29, of Fawley, Hampshire, admitted four counts of attempted murder and dangerous driving at Sheffield Crown Court, after the crash near Penistone, South Yorkshire. Two girls, aged seven and eight, and two boys, aged 21 months and nine months, were seriously injured. Scott will serve at least 14 years. As a result of her injuries, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life. She was left partially paralysed and remains in hospital, having lost a large section of her skull in the hammer attack. Scott's other children also suffered severe injuries, and are still recovering, the court heard. Both the boys have to wear protective helmets. The court was told Scott had attacked the children in the car during a cocaine-induced psychotic episode. He then drove at 92mph into the wall of the Travellers Inn, at Oxspring, on the A629. Scott admitted four counts of attempted murder and one count of dangerous driving in January. The judge, Mrs Justice O'Farrell, told Scott: ""You, their father, on whom they were entitled to rely for love, affection and comfort and, in particular, on whom they did rely to keep them safe, inflicted shocking injuries that will have long-term limiting implications for them. ""You will have to live for the rest of your life knowing that you have damaged, in some cases irrecoverably, the health, both physically and psychologically, of your children."" She added that Scott's ex-partner is still ""haunted by the screams of her children that she heard when she first saw them in hospital"". The crash happened at the junction of Bower Hill, Coates Lane and the A629 The court heard Scott had picked up the children - who lived with his ex-partner near Southampton - and taken them on a two-day trip around the country. It heard Scott had been a loving father to his children and his stepdaughter even after the breakdown of his relationship with his former partner. Prosecutor Simon Keeley QC told the court Scott was convinced he was being chased by a Southampton-based gang who intended to harm him and his children. Defending, Michelle Colborne QC, said Scott's intention was to kill the children ""to save them from a worse fate"". Ms Colborne said Scott had ""little or no memory"" of what had happened. Although he was found to be suffering from ""short-lived psychosis"" at the time, she said this did not amount to a psychiatric defence to attempted murder. Det Ch Insp David Stopford from South Yorkshire Police said it was one of the most harrowing cases he had ever worked on. He said: ""The ordeal those young children were subjected to was utterly horrendous and I'm pleased that Scott has today been jailed for a significant length of time."" ""Three of the four children are now recovering at home with their family. ""One of the children, a seven-year-old girl, is still receiving treatment in hospital today but we are hopeful she will soon be able to be at home with her family and her siblings,"" he added. Peter Mann, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This was a serious and determined effort to kill four young children. ""Medical specialists concluded that Scott inflicted multiple, deliberate blows upon them consistent with a hammer attack. The sheer ferocity of the attack and the appalling nature of the children's injuries is utterly shocking.""

Brother's plea to missing stag do man,"This video can not be played Eamonn Colgan has given an emotional appeal for his brother to come home The brother of Liam Colgan, who disappeared on a stag do in Hamburg, has issued a plea for him to get in touch. Meanwhile German police have said they have ""ever growing concern"" for him. Liam, 29, from Inverness, went missing on Saturday during a trip to Germany ahead of his brother Eamonn's wedding. The family revealed police are investigating a possible sighting of a ""confused"" man on Wednesday in the Buxtehude area of the city. Speaking to Newsbeat in Hamburg, Eamonn has sent a message to Liam, saying: ""Please, please come home. Everyone misses you. You're very much loved."" ""I don't know what happened to you, just please get in touch, find a way."" Eamonn, 33, is supposed to be getting married in two weeks' time. Liam had organised the whole stag do and was in charge of all the arrangements. Hamburg police have told Newsbeat they are ""not actively looking"" for Liam in the Elbe (the city's main river) - but say they're doing everything they can to find him. Officers say they acted ""very, very quickly"" when he was reported missing. ""We came to the conclusion that, even though this is a 29-year-old male, he was highly alcoholised in a city he doesn't know, possibly without orientation,"" a police spokesperson told Newsbeat. ""So we have to presume, especially with the temperatures outside, that this is in fact a threat to his life and wellbeing."" The group arrived in Hamburg last Friday and headed out to the Reeperbahn area of the city. It's famous for its nightlife - from bars and restaurants to sex shops and strip clubs. ""We went to a few different bars and by the end of the night our group had splintered a bit - that's what happens on nights out,"" says Eamonn. The last bar they were in was the Hamborger Viermaster. ""We thought Liam had left just a couple of minutes before us,"" remembers Eamonn. ""When he wasn't waiting for us outside, there was no reason to panic. He'd organised the whole trip so he'd researched the city and knew better than any of us how to get home."" But when Eamonn woke the next morning, Liam wasn't there. Liam Colgan was celebrating his brother's stag do when he went missing ""That's when panic set in. I was sharing a room with him. We looked in all the other rooms but there was no sign of him."" Eamonn was worried enough to go straight to the police. But because it's not uncommon for people to go missing on stag nights, officers in Hamburg couldn't treat it as a missing persons case until 24 hours had passed. ""We knew something was wrong. ""He would've returned, he would've known we'd be worrying - especially as his mobile phone battery had died so he knew we couldn't contact him."" Eamonn and Liam's dad had been on the trip too. But calling his mum back home was hard. ""I don't think she really took it in - I think she thought he'd just turn up. ""It's probably more difficult now when he's been missing a few days. I find talking to the media much easier than calling home - because that's when it gets upsetting."" Eamonn's stag do Officers in Hamburg have made contact with hospitals and taxi companies, used search dogs, conducted witness interviews, published photographs in newspapers, TV and online and tried to find his mobile phone. Initially Eamonn, a police officer himself, went home. ""Going back without him was horrible. I felt guilty about leaving,"" he says. He's now back in the German city to help the police and is trying to get Liam's face shown around Hamburg as much as possible. Liam was last seen in Hamburg in the early hours of Saturday ""We are getting more people coming forward. We don't know if it'll lead to anything but it makes me feel more positive. ""We just have to keep thinking we'll get that bit of information that we need to find him and get him home."" Until Liam's family finds out what happened, Eamonn's wedding won't be a priority. ""The wedding is not even a thought to me or my fiancee"", he says. ""It won't be going ahead without Liam. ""I can't even say 'if'. When we bring him home, we can worry about the wedding. It's not a thought just now. We're just doing whatever we can to find him.""

FBI 'was warned' about Florida gunman,"This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' The FBI has launched a review over its handling of a warning about the teenager accused of carrying out Wednesday's school shooting in Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, has appeared in court charged with premeditated murder. With 17 people killed, this is the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. Mr Cruz reportedly commented on a YouTube post last year that he would be a ""professional school shooter"". The FBI admitted that a user had alerted authorities to the post. Teachers were also warned about Mr Cruz, who was not allowed on campus with a backpack, US media report. The FBI said it had investigated the YouTube comment but had been unable to fully identify the person who posted it. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The attack happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Fourteen people were wounded, three of whom remain in a critical condition. On Thursday, Mr Cruz confessed to investigators that he carried out the shooting, adding that he had a backpack full of ammunition. Expressing his condolences earlier, US President Donald Trump said he was ""making plans to visit"" Parkland. This video can not be played Florida shooting suspect appears in court After seeing a comment on a YouTube post last year by Mr Cruz, user Ben Bennight contacted the FBI and spoke to representatives for about 20 minutes. Mr Bennight said the FBI contacted him again following the school shooting in Parkland. The FBI confirmed on Thursday that they were made aware of the comment, adding that they had conducted ""checks"" but were unable to identify the person behind it. Meanwhile maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald newspaper that school authorities had emailed teachers about Mr Cruz's behaviour. ""We were told last year that he wasn't allowed on campus with a backpack on him,""Mr Gard told the Miami Herald.,external ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" Updates as they happened Is it time to arm teachers? Florida shooting: A survivor's story It is unclear why Mr Cruz was expelled from the school. Former schoolmate Joshua Charo said Mr Cruz had been found with bullets in his backpack. ""I can't say I was shocked,"" Mr Charo said after the shooting. ""He seemed like the kind of kid who would do something like this."" The school's 3,000 students were almost at the end of their day when the attack broke out Other students echoed that opinion. ""Everyone predicted it,"" one told local station WFOR. But police said they had not been warned of a possible attack by Mr Cruz. US media quote the head of white supremacist group the Republic of Florida Jordan Jereb as saying Mr Cruz had once trained with them, but the group had not wanted or ordered him to carry out a school shooting. However local media later reported thatinvestigators had been unable to find any link between Mr Cruz and the ROF,external. What we know about the suspect Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Mr Cruz's social media profiles were ""very, very disturbing"".

Barry Bennell guilty of further sex abuse,"This video can not be played February 2018: Chris Unsworth, Micky Fallon and Steven Walters Three of Barry Bennell's victims have told how he turned their dreams into a ""horrendous nightmare"" after the former youth football coach was convicted of 43 sex assaults on boys. Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was found guilty of abusing 11 boys aged eight to 15. Speaking outside Liverpool Crown Court, another victim, Andy Woodward, said ""justice has been served"". It is understood 86 others have come forward to say they were victims. The jury, which deliberated over five days, had been told of Bennell's abuse of 12 boys between 1979 and 1990. Before the case he admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys, two of whom were also part of the allegations he was tried on. 'My dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell' A cruel paedophile who showed no remorse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' He was found guilty of 36 charges on Tuesday, and a further seven counts on Thursday. Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, appeared in court via videolink during the five-week trial due to illness. He could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were returned by a 10-1 majority. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" He will be sentenced on Monday and will be produced from custody to attend the hearing. It was the fourth time Bennell had been convicted of abusing boys. The jury was told he hadpreviously received jail sentences in the UK and in the USin 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest police investigation began in November 2016 when Andy Woodward gave interviews about his experiences to the Guardian and BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Speaking outside court after the verdict, the ex-Crewe defender said: ""Justice has been served today and people will be able to move on with their lives including myself."" This video can not be played Andy Woodward says 'justice has been served' Mr Woodward said he believed ""the football clubs that were accountable for this... could have stopped this for so many years... And I think now's the time that that comes sort of out. ""And I would personally like after 15 months, an apology from Crewe Alexandra for what happened to us boys."" Ex-Manchester City youth player Chris Unsworth, who was abused by Bennell when he was a scout at the club, stood alongside Micky Fallon and Steve Walters as he read a statement. The three men are supporters of the Offside Trust, which was set up by ex-professional players to support abuse survivors. Mr Unsworth said: ""We stand before you today as men united in justice, but this is about so much more than us."" Mr Fallon, who was targeted by Bennell at Crewe, said: ""We stand before you today as men united but, at the same time, we were very young boys. We were little boys with a dream and our innocence was shattered. Our dreams turned into the most horrendous nightmare."" Bary Bennell could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were announed Prosecutors described Bennell as a ""predatory paedophile"" who abused boys on an ""industrial scale"". They told the trial he had a ""power hold"" over the aspiring professional players. Boys were abused at his home - including a property in Derbyshire where he had arcade games and a puma and a monkey - on trips away, and in his car on the way to and from training, they said. Det Insp Sarah Oliver, who led the investigation, said Bennell had betrayed the trust of the young players. ""As a football coach he should have provided nothing more than safety and support for the players in his care,"" she said. ""Instead he abused them. He also abused the trust of their families who had placed them into that care so they could pursue their dreams of being professional footballers. He has shattered those dreams and left them burdened for decades."" In a statement, Crewe Alexandra expressed its ""deepest sympathies"" to Bennell's victims and said it worked closely with the police investigation. It added it was was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell or had received any complaint before or during his employment with the club. Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Manchester City offered ""heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured"". The club said it was keen to speak to any survivor or witness to sexual abuse which might be connected to Manchester City or which could support a review it launched after the latest allegations were raised in 2016.

A cruel paedophile who showed no remorse,"Barry Bennell, who has been convicted of 43 counts of historical child sex offences, was interviewed dozens of times by police. Those who questioned him say he is a ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" man who failed to show ""one iota"" of remorse. ""The only person that matters to Barry Bennell is Barry Bennell,"" says Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver, who sat through 30 interviews with the convicted paedophile. She is one of 25 detectives who worked on the investigation into Bennell's abuse - which is one of the biggest and most complicated cases in the history of Cheshire Constabulary. Bennell was a ""predatory paedophile"" who preyed upon the dreams of young footballers he was supposed to be coaching, his trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was a child molester on an ""industrial scale"". In his house in the Peak District, he had arcade machines, a pool table, and big TVs. At various times he owned a monkey and a wild cat. It was a ""a kids' paradise"", Bennell once boasted to police. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" During the trial, prosecutors compared him to the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Yet throughout his numerous interviews, Bennell remained ""completely indifferent"" to the suffering he caused, DI Oliver says. He is a ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" man, she adds. Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' Ex-football coach Barry Bennell guilty of further sex abuse When police raided a small bungalow at the top of a quiet cul-de-sac in Milton Keynes in November 2016, the crimes Bennell had committed came as a complete surprise to his neighbours. Bennell had lived in the council-owned bungalow under the name Richard Jones for more than four years, they said, running a small computer repair business. He made extra money by selling items online and at car boot sales, according to one neighbour. He had dogs, all named after Hebridean islands. Bennell's golden retriever Skye was taken by police when they raided his home. Residents had run-ins with him - mainly about people collecting items from his house late at night and taking up parking on the road. He was ""arrogant"" and ""thought he was untouchable,"" one added. His Facebook profile - in the name of Richard Barry - includes photographs of Bennell's visits to theme parks, including Thorpe Park and Alton Towers, to north Wales and a safari park; holidays to Gran Canaria and Derbyshire. Another photo from his past shows him coaching young footballers in the US - a country in which he spent three years in prison for abusing a boy at a holiday camp. Bennell's neighbours knew he was unwell. He was being fed through a tube in his stomach and he lived with a woman, who he claimed was a female carer. When he suddenly vanished for a year in 2015, most assumed he had died. The woman told one neighbour he was staying at a bungalow in Devon. Bennell's golden retriever Skye was led away from his home in Milton Keynes after his arrest in 2016 But Bennell was not in Devon. He was in prison for a third time - his second time behind bars in the UK for child sex offences. ""Then one day I saw him out there,"" a neighbour said pointing towards the street. ""I rang my friend and said 'you'll never guess who has just come back from the dead.'"" Within another year, Bennell had been named by a string of ex-footballers as a serial paedophile and child rapist. He was re-arrested in November 2016 and remanded in prison, where he has been ever since. Before his trial began Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys. His bungalow was boarded up for months after a window was smashed. A family now lives there. Officers had to complete a 300-mile roundtrip from Cheshire to HMP Woodhill, in Milton Keynes, to interview Bennell. ""There was initially a sense from him that he was angry and he didn't really see why he should have to account for what happened all those years ago,"" DI Oliver says. ""He was quite indignant actually."" This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police how he groomed young boys In one interview, Bennell said he remembered one complainant as ""a good looking lad"", but denied he had abused him. ""I remember him because I remember thinking that you know, he was the one, the one who got away..."" he told police. One victim's description of Bennell was put to him - a stocky man with blond permed hair who ""loved himself"". ""I always thought I was brilliant,"" Bennell told officers, adding: ""And it wasn't permed, it was natural."" In another police interview, Bennell denied abusing a boy, suggesting he was too young for his taste. He couldn't have done it, he argued, because he ""aimed"" for 13 year olds. ""That was puberty age and they were becoming a bit more strong-willed and not tied to the apron strings,"" he told police. Throughout questioning, Bennell has been ""utterly indifferent to the fact he has traumatised these boys"", says DI Oliver. ""Not once has he shown one iota of empathy to his victims and what he has put them through."" Andy Woodward attended the trial with his wife Zelda During the trial, at Liverpool Crown Court, Prosecutor Nicholas Johnson QC made a point of reminding the jury that Bennell had married the sister of one of his victims. Andy Woodward, who waived his right to anonymity to speak about being repeatedly abused by Bennell as a young boy, at one stage had to describe his abuser as his brother-in-law. ""Just imagine,"" Mr Johnson urged the jury. ""What does that tell you about his attitude to other people and their expendability to him?"" Bennell did not attend the five-week trial. In his absence, his defence team accused his victims of making allegations in order to get compensation. But those victims, DI Oliver says, were just ""little boys who wanted to play football"". ""When you hear them give their evidence in court they are little boys again and they are waiting for him to say sorry."" They are still waiting.

Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer',"This video can not be played What you need to know about bread A link between highly processed foods and cancer has been suggested by French researchers. They classified foods including cakes, chicken nuggets and mass-produced bread as ""ultra-processed"". A study of 105,000 people hinted the more of such foods people ate, the greater their risk of cancer. A lot of caution is being expressed about the study, but experts said a healthy diet is best. Mass-produced packaged breads and buns Sweet or savoury packaged snacks including crisps Chocolate bars and sweets Sodas and sweetened drinks Meatballs, poultry and fish nuggets Instant noodles and soups Frozen or shelf-life ready meals Foods made mostly or entirely from sugar, oils and fats Diet is already known to affect the risk of cancer. Being overweight is thebiggest preventable cause of the disease after smoking,externaland the World Health Organization saysprocessed meat does slightly increase the risk of cancer. But what about ultra-processed foods? The team - at Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite - used food surveys on two days to work out what people were eating. Those on the study, who were mostly middle-aged women, were followed for an average of five years. The results,in the British Medical Journal,external, showed that if the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet increased by 10%, then the number of cancers detected increased by 12%. During the study: On average, 18% of people's diet was ultra-processed On average, there were 79 cancers per 10,000 people each year Upping the proportion of processed food by 10% would lead to nine extra cancers per 10,000 people per year The researchers concluded: ""These results suggest that the rapidly increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods may drive an increasing burden of cancer in the next decades."" But they said the findings need to ""be confirmed by other large-scale"" studies and research was needed to establish what could be behind the link. This study is far from the definitive take on ultra-processed foods and cancer. It cannot say ultra-processed foods are a cause of cancer. There are also factors that muddy the waters as people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had other behaviours that have been linked to cancer. They were much more likely to smoke, were less active, consumed more calories overall and weremore likely to be taking the oral contraceptive,external. While the researchers did adjust their analysis for this they say their impact ""cannot be entirely excluded"". Prof Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said: ""It's already known that eating a lot of these foods can lead to weight gain, and being overweight or obese can also increase your risk of cancer, so it's hard to disentangle the effects of diet and weight."" 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water New antibiotic family discovered in dirt Gang 'stole spinal fluid from women' Overall she said the study was a ""warning signal to us to have a healthy diet"" but people should not worry about eating a bit of processed food ""here and there"" as long as they were getting plenty of fruit, vegetables and fibre. Dr Ian Johnson, from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, said the study had ""identified some rather weak associations"". Does the type of bread you eat make a difference to your cancer risk? But he criticised the vagueness of the term ultra-processed. He said: ""The problem is that the definition of ultra-processed foods they have used is so broad and poorly defined that it is impossible to decide exactly what, if any, causal connections have been observed."" For Prof Tom Sanders at King's College London, the definition of ultra-processed foods throws up too many quirks. He said mass-produced bread would be classed as ultra-processed, but a home-made loaf or bread from a posh local bakery would not. ""This classification seems arbitrary and based on the premise that food produced industrially has a different nutritional and chemical composition from that produced in the home or by artisans. This is not the case,"" Prof Sanders said. Even the accompanying commentary in the British Medical Journal warned against jumping to conclusions. Martin Lajous and Adriana Monge from the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico, warned ""we are a long way from understanding the full implications of food processing for health and well-being"". They said the study was simply ""an initial insight"". What you need to know about bread.

"Diet pill overdose death 'huge mistake'On the anniversary of her death, Beth Shipsey's parents say she did not mean to take her own life.","This video can not be played Doug Shipsey has challenged the government over his daughter's death The parents of a woman who overdosed on diet pills have rejected a coroner's finding of suicide. Beth Shipsey, 21, died after taking pills containing highly-toxic DNP in 2017. Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams concluded Ms Shipsey intended to take her own life and would have diedregardless of medical failings. But her father Doug said her death ""was a miscalculation, a huge mistake. It was another cry for help"". Midlands Live: Men 'stabbed in neck with Biro'; pollution probe after many fish found dead The inquest, which concluded on Wednesday, heard how Ms Shipsey had ongoing treatment for mental health issues, but was ""not considered a suicide risk"", despite previously taking 14 overdoses. She was on home leave from a psychiatric unit on the day she died. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire show on the anniversary of their daughter's death, Carole and Doug Shipsey said they were ""disappointed in the verdict"" of suicide. ""There's so much evidence that wasn't the case,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""There was no suicide note, no social media messages she left. ""That would indicate she meant to be found and taken to hospital and treated."" Ms Shipsey had taken 14 overdoses previously, her inquest heard Coroner Mr Williams also spoke of ""serious failures"" in Ms Shipsey's care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. But they ""became irrelevant"" as ""evidence suggests she would have died anyway"", he said. Mrs Shipsey disagreed and said she believed her daughter would have survived if she had received care earlier. ""People have survived with a higher level [of DNP in their blood] that have had supportive care,"" she said. ""Beth had no care in the four-and-a-half hours she was there."" Mrs Shipsey said she was not aware of the ""potency and toxicity"" of the diet pills her daughter was ordering online. She encouraged others to be ""aware"" and ""proactive"" about the dangers of DNP. ""We don't want people to think there's a safe therapeutic dose,"" Mrs Shipsey said. ""An envelope coming through the door with pills in it could be a killer,"" Mr Shipsey said. ""As turned out to be the case with Beth."" The pills taken by Ms Shipsey have ""no known antidote"" After the inquest, the trust in charge of the hospital apologised after there were found to have been ""significant failings"" in Ms Shipsey's care. It said it has ""made a series of improvements"" to address the issues highlighted by the coroner. The coroner's office declined to comment. 2,4-dinitrophenol, or DNP, is highly toxic and not intended for human consumption An industrial chemical, it is sold illegally in diet pills as a fat-burning substance Users experience a metabolism boost, leading to weight loss, but taking even a few tablets can be fatal Signs of acute poisoning include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heartbeat Consuming lower amounts over longer periods could lead to cataracts and skin lesions and impact on the heart, blood and nervous system Experts say buying drugs online is risky as medicines may be fake, out of date or extremely harmful Girl's diet pill death 'was suicide' Nurses missed note on diet pill drugs Diet pill death at overcrowded A&E Hospital missed diet pill overdose Mother's anger over diet pill death.

One million urge Snapchat roll-backSnapchat's changes have sparked a backlash as users complain that it is more difficult to use.7h7 hours agoTechnologyComments,"One million people have signed a petition calling on Snapchat to roll back its latest redesign. The changes were intended to separate interactions with friends from branded content - including that of celebrities and influencers. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegelwrote in a blog post,externalthat he believed blurring the two had contributed to the rise of fake news. However, thousands of Snapchat userssay that the new layout is hard to use,external. Nic Rumsey, who set up the petition, wrote that some are using Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps - which use servers abroad to mask the location of a device - in order to access the older version of the platform: ""That's how annoying this update has become,"" he said. ""Many 'new features' are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years."" The petition, posted on the change.org website, is one of several appealing to Snapchat to revert to its previous state. Users now swipe left to see and interact with their friends, and swipe right to see branded and celebrity content. Model Chrissie Teigen tweeted that she didn't like feeling that her followers no longer felt like ""friends"" as a result. ""How many people have to hate an update for it to be reconsidered?"" she asked. Some users have followed a six-step procedure, which involves turning off automatic updates and reinstalling the app in order to get the ""old"" style Snapchat back.

Barry Bennell guilty of further sex abuseThe ex-football coach is convicted of a total of 43 counts of child sex abuse against 11 victims.1h30 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played February 2018: Chris Unsworth, Micky Fallon and Steven Walters Three of Barry Bennell's victims have told how he turned their dreams into a ""horrendous nightmare"" after the former youth football coach was convicted of 43 sex assaults on boys. Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was found guilty of abusing 11 boys aged eight to 15. Speaking outside Liverpool Crown Court, another victim, Andy Woodward, said ""justice has been served"". It is understood 86 others have come forward to say they were victims. The jury, which deliberated over five days, had been told of Bennell's abuse of 12 boys between 1979 and 1990. Before the case he admitted seven charges of indecent assault on three boys, two of whom were also part of the allegations he was tried on. 'My dreams were shattered by Barry Bennell' A cruel paedophile who showed no remorse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' He was found guilty of 36 charges on Tuesday, and a further seven counts on Thursday. Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, appeared in court via videolink during the five-week trial due to illness. He could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were returned by a 10-1 majority. This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police interviewers: ""I always thought I was brilliant."" He will be sentenced on Monday and will be produced from custody to attend the hearing. It was the fourth time Bennell had been convicted of abusing boys. The jury was told he hadpreviously received jail sentences in the UK and in the USin 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest police investigation began in November 2016 when Andy Woodward gave interviews about his experiences to the Guardian and BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Speaking outside court after the verdict, the ex-Crewe defender said: ""Justice has been served today and people will be able to move on with their lives including myself."" This video can not be played Andy Woodward says 'justice has been served' Mr Woodward said he believed ""the football clubs that were accountable for this... could have stopped this for so many years... And I think now's the time that that comes sort of out. ""And I would personally like after 15 months, an apology from Crewe Alexandra for what happened to us boys."" Ex-Manchester City youth player Chris Unsworth, who was abused by Bennell when he was a scout at the club, stood alongside Micky Fallon and Steve Walters as he read a statement. The three men are supporters of the Offside Trust, which was set up by ex-professional players to support abuse survivors. Mr Unsworth said: ""We stand before you today as men united in justice, but this is about so much more than us."" Mr Fallon, who was targeted by Bennell at Crewe, said: ""We stand before you today as men united but, at the same time, we were very young boys. We were little boys with a dream and our innocence was shattered. Our dreams turned into the most horrendous nightmare."" Bary Bennell could be seen shaking his head and muttering when the final guilty verdicts were announed Prosecutors described Bennell as a ""predatory paedophile"" who abused boys on an ""industrial scale"". They told the trial he had a ""power hold"" over the aspiring professional players. Boys were abused at his home - including a property in Derbyshire where he had arcade games and a puma and a monkey - on trips away, and in his car on the way to and from training, they said. Det Insp Sarah Oliver, who led the investigation, said Bennell had betrayed the trust of the young players. ""As a football coach he should have provided nothing more than safety and support for the players in his care,"" she said. ""Instead he abused them. He also abused the trust of their families who had placed them into that care so they could pursue their dreams of being professional footballers. He has shattered those dreams and left them burdened for decades."" In a statement, Crewe Alexandra expressed its ""deepest sympathies"" to Bennell's victims and said it worked closely with the police investigation. It added it was was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell or had received any complaint before or during his employment with the club. Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Manchester City offered ""heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured"". The club said it was keen to speak to any survivor or witness to sexual abuse which might be connected to Manchester City or which could support a review it launched after the latest allegations were raised in 2016. It added its review also identified serious allegations of child sex abuse in respect of a second man with ""potential historic connections to the club"". The man is now dead and is not believed to be linked to Bennell. The Football Association said it acknowledged the ""traumatic experience"" of Bennell's victims ""and the bravery they have shown in coming forward"". It said an independent inquiry into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse in football had been set up and also urged victims and survivors to contact police ""if they are ready to do so"". This video can not be played Barry Bennell told police how he groomed young boys Bennell chose not to offer any evidence or witnesses in his defence and had told police he was suffering from cancer, which in turn had caused memory problems. His barrister accused the complainants of inventing stories about him and ""jumping on the bandwagon"".

"Ramaphosa takes over as SA presidentIn his first presidential speech, the former mineworker and businessman vows to tackle corruption.","This video can not be played Cheers and song as Ramaphosa elected South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa has become South Africa's president a day after embattled leader Jacob Zuma resigned. He was the only candidate nominated by parliament, which is dominated by his African National Congress. MPs broke into song at the announcement. In his first presidential speech, Mr Ramaphosa, 65, said he would tackle the corruption which allegedly became widespread under Mr Zuma. The ANC had told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Mr Zuma faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. One allegation is that he allowed the wealthy Gupta family, to whom he has personal ties, to wield influence over policy, in an example of ""state capture"". An arrest warrant has been issued for Ajay Gupta, one of the three most prominent Gupta brothers, officials said on Thursday. This follows a raid by the Hawks, an elite police unit, on their home on Wednesday. The family has denied corruption allegations. Africa Live: Ramaphosa takes over Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president South African press applauds Zuma exit Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma President Ramaphosa told parliament that corruption and state capture were ""on our radar screen"". He is due to deliver a State of the Nation address on Friday. This was delayed last week amid uncertainty about who should deliver it and Mr Zuma's reluctance to step down. One opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, walked out of the parliamentary debate. It wants new elections, rather than the ANC deciding on the identity of the new president. Analysis: Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa: The long road to power It is often said that Mr Ramaphosa has had his eye on the position of president since the ANC came to power in 1994. The story goes that he was so upset at not having been chosen by Nelson Mandela as his successor that he left politics and went into business. But Mr Ramaphosa has now finally realised that dream. He has said his priority is reviving South Africa's battered economy. But it won't be easy: Unemployment is currently at almost 30%, a rate which rises to nearly 40% for young people. Low growth rates and dwindling investor confidence were compounded by two credit agencies downgrading the economy to junk status. One of the first steps in improving that investor confidence is addressing the persistent claims of corruption at the heart of government. What next for South Africa? Six reasons why Zuma quit Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out There is a renewed sense of hope as Mr Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy.

Mr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president.

One million urge Snapchat roll-back,"One million people have signed a petition calling on Snapchat to roll back its latest redesign. The changes were intended to separate interactions with friends from branded content - including that of celebrities and influencers. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegelwrote in a blog post,externalthat he believed blurring the two had contributed to the rise of fake news. However, thousands of Snapchat userssay that the new layout is hard to use,external. Nic Rumsey, who set up the petition, wrote that some are using Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps - which use servers abroad to mask the location of a device - in order to access the older version of the platform: ""That's how annoying this update has become,"" he said. ""Many 'new features' are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years."" The petition, posted on the change.org website, is one of several appealing to Snapchat to revert to its previous state. Users now swipe left to see and interact with their friends, and swipe right to see branded and celebrity content. Model Chrissie Teigen tweeted that she didn't like feeling that her followers no longer felt like ""friends"" as a result. ""How many people have to hate an update for it to be reconsidered?"" she asked. Some users have followed a six-step procedure, which involves turning off automatic updates and reinstalling the app in order to get the ""old"" style Snapchat back.

Divorcing couples may clash over Bitcoin,"Divorcing couples are being warned to disclose all their assets amid fears that some may use digital currencies such as Bitcoin to hide their wealth. Lawyers suggest that the anonymous nature of these digital currencies could prove tempting to those involved in an acrimonious split. One solicitor said she had seen the ""first wave"" of cases where crypto-currencies were listed as assets. Courts have wide-ranging powers to investigate hidden assets. This could include a court appointing a digital forensic expert to analyse data when it is suspected someone is trying to hide money in cryptocurrency, The financial implications of divorce Virgin Money joins ban on buying Bitcoin on credit cards Vandana Chitroda, a partner at law firm Royds Withy King, said it was dealing with three cases in which the husband had bought crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum. ""These are the first cases we have seen, and we expect to see many more.  There will also be those divorces where a spouse may not have disclosed such assets, leaving a traceability nightmare,"" she said. Jacqueline Fitzgerald, partner at Wilsons law firm, said: ""Proving that one spouse has a substantial holding in a cryptocurrency and adding that to the marital assets can be a big problem."" The fact that there is no centralised system or opportunity to freeze these assets could cause difficulties, she suggested. This potentially made cases trickier than those when people tried to hide art or antiques, which were more easily traced. There was also a lack of guidance from the courts as to how these issues should be dealt with, mainly owing to the relatively recent emergence of mainstream cryptocurrency investment. There is no specific guidance from the Ministry of Justice, but the Advice Now guide, drafted by the Family Justice Council, says that both parties ""need to be honest about what you own and what income you have"". Ms Chitroda said that lawyers and their advisers, like many of their clients, had little experience in recovering and valuing these cryptocurrencies. In one of the cases her firm is dealing with, an original investment of Â£80,000 in November 2016 was valued at Â£1m in December 2017 and was now ""worth"" Â£600,000. She said that the divorce process took eight months on average, so numerous valuations would be needed for the court to be given accurate information.

Ramaphosa takes over as SA president,"This video can not be played Cheers and song as Ramaphosa elected South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa has become South Africa's president a day after embattled leader Jacob Zuma resigned. He was the only candidate nominated by parliament, which is dominated by his African National Congress. MPs broke into song at the announcement. In his first presidential speech, Mr Ramaphosa, 65, said he would tackle the corruption which allegedly became widespread under Mr Zuma. The ANC had told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Mr Zuma faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. One allegation is that he allowed the wealthy Gupta family, to whom he has personal ties, to wield influence over policy, in an example of ""state capture"". An arrest warrant has been issued for Ajay Gupta, one of the three most prominent Gupta brothers, officials said on Thursday. This follows a raid by the Hawks, an elite police unit, on their home on Wednesday. The family has denied corruption allegations.

Teenagers' spending habits revealed,"Girls start spending more than boys as they enter their teens and discover more expensive shampoo and make-up. At the ages of seven to nine, weekly spending is higher among boys (Â£8.50) than girls (Â£7.50), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Girls' spending then overtakes boys' at the age of 10 to 12 and accelerates in the 13 to 15 age group. While boys spent less than 10p a week on soap and cosmetics, girls spent Â£1.70 by the age of 13 to 15. But the figures also show that the teenagers spent less than they used to. In 2015-17, girls aged 13 to 15 spent an average of Â£20.20 a week, compared with Â£21.50 a week in 2002-04. Boys' spending dropped from Â£19.30 to Â£17.30 over the same period. The data is based on a diary of income and spending kept by children for the ONS over a two-week period. Grenfell Tower fire: Boy, 6, gives pocket money to victims 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' 'Children as young as 11 introduced to gambling' The ONS said that the factor that ""stood out"" when comparing spending among the older age groups was the amount paid for toiletries and cosmetics. This includes soap, shampoo and makeup. Only 2% of seven to 15-year-old boys bought at least one toiletry or cosmetic item in a two-week period, compared with 17% of girls of the same age. Girls aged seven to nine spent 20p a week on these items, rising to Â£1.70 for girls aged 13 to 15. Boys of all ages spent less than 10p a week. This video can not be played Dealing with debt: What do kids think about money? Other findings included: Girls spend double the amount a week (30p) on books than boys do, between the ages of seven and 15 The most was spent on clothes and shoes - nearly Â£1.80 a week Boys spent more than 10 times as much as girls on computer games and software (Â£1.10 compared with 10p a week) One of the most common buys for children aged seven to 15 years was soft drinks, including fizzy drinks More than half (56%) of these children bought at least one soft drink within a two-week period, with most being consumed away from the home. Ice cream was bought more frequently among pre-teen children. While spending has fallen compared with the previous generation, there remained some expensive items on the spending list, including bikes, mobile phones and computers.

Ride-by moped thefts on the rise,"This video can not be played The London streets most affected by ride-by moped thefts Ride-by moped thefts and robberies on London's main shopping streets have increased six-fold over the last two years. Met Police data shows Oxford Street is the worst hit with 291 offences in one year - up from 13 in 2014-15. A criminology expert said moped-enabled theft is the ""crime of the moment"" as it is ""ridiculously easy"" to do. Oxford Street's crowds give thieves cover and there are plenty of ""rich pickings"" to choose from, he added. Porn star 'free to discuss' Trump story Transgender first for Australian football Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer' Regent Street saw the number of thefts jump from three to 91 between 2015 and 2017, while Bond Street went from one to 14. Supt Mark Payne, from the Met, said ""intensive operations"" in the West End have led to a decrease in moped-enabled crime since October 2017. A criminology expert said 'nowadays people are phone zombies' and unaware of their surroundings Oxford, Regent and Bond Street combined have 200 million visitors a year. Upper Street, Kings Road and Marylebone High Street were the other central shopping destinations most affected. Many offenders travel in pairs on one moped so the passenger can grab items out of the victims' hands as they drive past. Dr Simon Harding, associate professor of criminology at the University of West London, said the rise in these crimes could be because phones are more valuable than they used to be, and are an easy item to steal because people use them so much. ""If you look at mobile phones five years ago, they were pretty much in our pockets unless we got a phone call,"" he said. ""Nowadays people are phone zombies. They are on their phone walking along the street, bumping into people, not knowing where they are going."" Offenders are also motivated by the fact they will not have to pay to get the phone unlocked if they can grab it while it is in use, he said. Gloria Matuba, a 23-year-old charity worker, was targeted on her way to catch a bus home from work near Old Street, in Islington, in December 2016. ""I was on the phone to my friend, having a chit-chat as you do, and not really paying attention,"" she said. ""The way it happened, it was so quick. They came up behind me, they mounted the pavement. ""I thought someone was nudging into me but actually they'd taken my phone."" Ms Matuba said she was left ""paranoid and hysterical"" after the theft, which did not lead to any convictions - and that the increase in the crimes ""doesn't make me feel safe at all"". ""Fair enough, I lost my phone, but we've seen that they actually hurt people,"" she said. Thousands of people in London have been victims of these crimes,including former chancellor George Osborne. Of the 848 moped-enabled thefts, robberies and burglaries recorded in 14 major retail spots in the capital since November 2014, 79% were theft or attempted theft of personal property. Dr Harding said the ""culture"" that moped offenders are a part of means they will be armed. ""You'd be a fool to think they weren't,"" he added. Earlier this month a 22-year-old man was stabbed after he chased down a moped passenger who snatched his phone out of his hand on Oxford Street. Police are developing tactics to tackle the crime surge, such as using remote controlled spikes to puncture suspects' tyres. Supt Payne added: ""Offenders rely on the unwariness of the public to snatch their phones while they make calls so it is important [to be aware] at all times, particularly when emerging from a train or underground station."" Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, said she plans to ""stamp out"" the ""reckless and intimidating"" offences, with help from the Met. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company - which represents high-end traders on Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street - added: ""We will continue to work with public services to investigate these incidents and ensure our district remains secure for everyone.""

At least 17 dead in US school shooting,"This video can not be played ""We knew it wasn't a drill"": Students, police and politicians react in the aftermath of the shooting At least 17 people are dead after a 19-year-old man opened fire at a high school campus in Parkland, Florida. The suspect was Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school who had been expelled. He escaped with fleeing students but is now in police custody. As the attack unfolded students were forced to hide as police swooped in on the building. It is the deadliest school shooting since 26 people were killed at Connecticut school Sandy Hook in 2012. It is the sixth school shooting incident this year so far that has either wounded or killed students. What we know about the suspect Harrowing accounts of school shooting Celebrities call for 'policy and change' Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Mr Cruz killed three people outside the school, before entering the building and killing another 12. Two people later died after being taken to hospital. ""It's catastrophic. There really are no words,"" Sheriff Israel tweeted later. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse Three people remain in a critical condition and three others are in stable condition, health officials said. The victims are still being identified. Sheriff Israel said a football coach was among the dead but no names have been released. The attack began at 14:30 local time (19:30 GMT) on Wednesday at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, about an hour north of Miami. The local public school district tweeted that ""students and staff heard what sounded like gunfire"" just before the end of the day. Witnesses said that the suspect set off a fire alarm before he began shooting. Florida shooting: How the attack happened Florida shooting: A survivor's story As it happened: Florida school gunman shoots 'dozens' Police and Swat team members swarmed the campus and began clearing students from the school, as parents and ambulances converged on the scene. Video footage from the scene showed students being evacuated in small groups Mr Cruz, who had been expelled for ""disciplinary reasons"", was taken into custody without incident in the nearby town of Coral Springs about an hour after he left the high school, according to police. Officials gave no details of the reasons for his expulsion but student Victoria Olvera, 17, told the Associated Press it was because of a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. She also said he had been abusive towards the ex-girlfriend. Is domestic violence a common theme in mass shootings?,external Why some argue teachers should be armed Local media report that Mr Cruz bought his gun, an AR-15, legally and kept it locked away in the house of the family he was staying with, following his adoptive mother's death in November. Neighbours and friends said Mr Cruz was known to shoot at chickens, and talk about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs. ""We have already begun to dissect his websites and things on social media that he was on and some of the things... are very, very disturbing,"" Sheriff Israel said. Police released a photo of Nikolas Cruz The school has nearly 3,000 students. Classes are cancelled for the rest of this week. Many students said they thought it was a drill because a fire alarm practice had taken place shortly before the shooting. Students told US media they hid under desks, in closets or barricaded doors as loud shots rang out. One student, Bailey Vosberg, said: ""I heard what sounded like fireworks and I looked at my friend and he asked me if I heard that."" ""Immediately, I knew. I didn't say anything to him, I just hopped over the fence and I went straight to the road that our school is located on - and as I got there there was just Swat cars and police units, police vehicles just flying by, helicopters over the top of us."" Students were reunited with parents at a nearby ""staging area"" in Coral Springs Caesar Figueroa, a parent, told CBS News his daughter was hiding in a closet when she called him. He told the news outlet that he told her not to call him because he did not want the gunman to hear her voice. ""It's the worst nightmare not hearing from my daughter for 20 minutes, it was the longest 20 minutes of my life,"" Mr Figeuroa said. A teacher told WSVN that she hid in a closet with 19 students for 40 minutes,external- and that the school underwent training for such a situation six weeks ago. Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that the shooting was ""designed & executed to maximize loss of life"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""You should know the facts of that incident before you run out and prescribe some law that you claim could have prevented it,"" he told Fox News. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the shooting was ""pure evil"", but also refused to be drawn into a discussion about gun control.

Teachers 'warned' about Florida gunman,"This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' The FBI has launched a review over its handling of a warning about the teenager accused of carrying out Wednesday's school shooting in Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, has appeared in court charged with premeditated murder. With 17 people killed, this is the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. Mr Cruz reportedly commented on a YouTube post last year that he would be a ""professional school shooter"". The FBI admitted that a user had alerted authorities to the post. Teachers were also warned about Mr Cruz, who was not allowed on campus with a backpack, US media report. The FBI said it had investigated the YouTube comment but had been unable to fully identify the person who posted it. Who are the victims? How the school attack happened Analysis: One shooting, two Americas The attack happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Fourteen people were wounded, three of whom remain in a critical condition. On Thursday, Mr Cruz confessed to investigators that he carried out the shooting, adding that he had a backpack full of ammunition. Expressing his condolences earlier, US President Donald Trump said he was ""making plans to visit"" Parkland. This video can not be played Florida shooting suspect appears in court After seeing a comment on a YouTube post last year by Mr Cruz, user Ben Bennight contacted the FBI and spoke to representatives for about 20 minutes. Mr Bennight said the FBI contacted him again following the school shooting in Parkland. The FBI confirmed on Thursday that they were made aware of the comment, adding that they had conducted ""checks"" but were unable to identify the person behind it. Meanwhile maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald newspaper that school authorities had emailed teachers about Mr Cruz's behaviour. ""We were told last year that he wasn't allowed on campus with a backpack on him,""Mr Gard told the Miami Herald.,external ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" Updates as they happened Is it time to arm teachers? Florida shooting: A survivor's story It is unclear why Mr Cruz was expelled from the school. Former schoolmate Joshua Charo said Mr Cruz had been found with bullets in his backpack. ""I can't say I was shocked,"" Mr Charo said after the shooting. ""He seemed like the kind of kid who would do something like this."" The school's 3,000 students were almost at the end of their day when the attack broke out Other students echoed that opinion. ""Everyone predicted it,"" one told local station WFOR. But police said they had not been warned of a possible attack by Mr Cruz. US media quote the head of white supremacist group the Republic of Florida Jordan Jereb as saying Mr Cruz had once trained with them, but the group had not wanted or ordered him to carry out a school shooting. However local media later reported thatinvestigators had been unable to find any link between Mr Cruz and the ROF,external. What we know about the suspect Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Mr Cruz's social media profiles were ""very, very disturbing"". Two separate Instagram accounts, now deleted, purport to show Mr Cruz posing with guns and knives. Mr Cruz allegedly used an AR-15 rifle in the attack, which he had reportedly bought legally. This video can not be played Footage posted on social media captures the moment Nikolas Cruz opened fire Details of the 17 victims are emerging. The school's assistant football coachAaron Feiswas taken to hospital after jumping in front of students to shield them from bullets. His team tweeted that he had ""died a hero"".

Airbus takes new hit on military planeThe aerospace group has now written off a total of â¬8bn in losses on the military transport plane.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments,"Airbus has written off another â¬1.3bn (Â£1.2bn) on its troubled A400M military transport plane, bringing total losses on the project to more than â¬8bn. The A400M has had setbacks over the years, most seriously a crash during a test flight in Spain in 2015 which led to the deaths of the four crew members. The aerospace group reported better-than-expected 2017 profits of â¬4.3bn, against â¬3.9bn in 2016. Shares in the company were up 10% by Thursday's close. Revenues were ""stable"" at â¬66.8bn, up from â¬66.6bn. In its statement, Airbus said higher aircraft deliveries had been ""offset by a reduction in revenues of around â¬2bn from the perimeter changes"". Last week, Airbus reached a provisional agreement with seven European NATO buyer countries over further delays in deliveries for the A400M. Chief executive Tom Enders said in the results statement: ""On A400M, we made progress on the industrial and capabilities front and agreed a re-baselining with government customers which will significantly reduce the remaining programme risks. This is reflected in a substantial one-off charge."" Emirates placed an order last month for up to 36 new A380s Airbus said it expected to deliver about 800 commercial aircraft in 2018 if engine manufacturers met their commitments. If it does hit those delivery targets, it said it would see profits increase by about 20% this year. The company said it had ""continued the production ramp-up"" of the A320neo commercial plane - an upgraded version of the medium-haul A320 jet with more fuel-efficient engines. It ""finally delivered"" a record 181 aircraft last year ""despite persistent engine issues"", said Mr Enders. The ""engine issues"" include delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney and CFM International. ""The A320neo ramp-up remains challenging and requires that the engine suppliers deliver in line with commitments,"" Airbus said. Addressing the A320 problems on a conference call, Mr Enders said: ""We have been in permanent crisis management for the last two or three years."" Last month, the Middle Eastern airline Emirates announced an order for up to 36 Airbus A380s. The $16bn (Â£11.5bn) deal amounted to a reprieve for the A380 after Airbus threatened to stop making the jet unless it could strike a deal with Emirates. In its results statement, Airbus said Emirates Airline's latest order provided ""increased visibility on the A380 programme for the years to come"". The A400M was meant to be the flagship of Airbus' military fleet - but the programme has been dogged by seemingly endless delays, technical problems and what the chief executive, Tom Enders, has described as a 'flawed contractual set-up"". As a result, the heavy-lifter has ended up being a financial deadweight on the company. The new write-off of â¬1.3bn takes the total so far to more than â¬8bn. That isn't the only issue causing concern. The company is the subject of ongoing corruption investigations in both the UK and France, over its use of intermediaries in major aircraft deals; it now seems the US authorities are taking an interest as well. With the chief operating officer, Fabrice Bregier, stepping down and the top salesman, John Leahy, retiring, the company is already in a state of management flux - and Tom Enders is also due to leave next year. But, on the plus side, Airbus's order book is still full to bursting. It has even managed to log a new order for the troubled A380 superjumbo, enough to keep the production line going for another decade. And profits are rising. So it isn't all bad news - far from it.

Ramaphosa to take over as SA president,"This video can not be played Cheers and song as Ramaphosa elected South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa has become South Africa's president a day after embattled leader Jacob Zuma resigned. He was the only candidate nominated by parliament, which is dominated by his African National Congress. MPs broke into song at the announcement. In his first presidential speech, Mr Ramaphosa, 65, said he would tackle the corruption which allegedly became widespread under Mr Zuma. The ANC had told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Mr Zuma faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. One allegation is that he allowed the wealthy Gupta family, to whom he has personal ties, to wield influence over policy, in an example of ""state capture"". An arrest warrant has been issued for Ajay Gupta, one of the three most prominent Gupta brothers, officials said on Thursday. This follows a raid by the Hawks, an elite police unit, on their home on Wednesday. The family has denied corruption allegations. Africa Live: Ramaphosa takes over Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president South African press applauds Zuma exit Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma President Ramaphosa told parliament that corruption and state capture were ""on our radar screen"". He is due to deliver a State of the Nation address on Friday. This was delayed last week amid uncertainty about who should deliver it and Mr Zuma's reluctance to step down. One opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, walked out of the parliamentary debate. It wants new elections, rather than the ANC deciding on the identity of the new president. Analysis: Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa: The long road to power It is often said that Mr Ramaphosa has had his eye on the position of president since the ANC came to power in 1994. The story goes that he was so upset at not having been chosen by Nelson Mandela as his successor that he left politics and went into business. But Mr Ramaphosa has now finally realised that dream. He has said his priority is reviving South Africa's battered economy. But it won't be easy: Unemployment is currently at almost 30%, a rate which rises to nearly 40% for young people. Low growth rates and dwindling investor confidence were compounded by two credit agencies downgrading the economy to junk status. One of the first steps in improving that investor confidence is addressing the persistent claims of corruption at the heart of government. What next for South Africa? Six reasons why Zuma quit Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out There is a renewed sense of hope as Mr Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy. The markets appeared to welcome Mr Zuma's resignation. The South African currency, the rand, reaching its strongest levels in three years - at 11.6570 rand for $1 in early trading. Some will miss him though, pointing to achievements like announcing the abolition of fees for higher education, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg. Mr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president. He led the country for more than a third of its time after apartheid. But he leaves office with several scandals hanging over him, and with South Africa's economy in dire straits. This video can not be played South Africans share their hopes for the future after Zuma's departure Shaun Abrahams, head of the National Prosecuting Authority, told Reuters news agency: ""I've been advised by my prosecuting team that Mr. Ajay Gupta is a fugitive from justice."" But eight other suspects did appear in court on Thursday on fraud and money laundering charges, local media report. The only member of the Gupta family to appear was Varun, who was Chief Operating Officer of the Gupta-owned mining firm Oakbay Resources and Energy. All eight told the court they had done nothing wrong.

EU 'removes Brexit punishment clause',"Both sides say they want a time-limited transition after the UK leaves the EU next year EU diplomats have removed a so-called ""punishment clause"" from a draft text of the arrangement for the Brexit transition period, the BBC understands. A footnote published by the European Commission last week suggested that the UK would lose access to elements of the European single market if it broke EU rules during the transition period. But officials have now promised new wording that makes reference to the EU's standard infringement procedures. Brexit is scheduled for 29 March 2019. The two sides are set to begin negotiations next month on the terms of transition period after the UK's departure, which the EU has said should last until 31 December 2020. Theresa May has said a time-limited implementation period of about two years will allow businesses to adjust to changes arising from Brexit and enable the UK to negotiate its future relationship with the EU. The EU has said the UK should abide by all existing rules and regulations during the transition phase and, in text published last week, suggested there would be specific sanctions if this was not respected. Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Juncker angry at  EU 'superstate' claims This angered a number of Conservative MPs who argue the transition terms being proposed are too punitive and, in particular, the UK should not be expected to sign up to any new laws that it has not had any say over. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that, following a meeting earlier on Wednesday, officials from the other 27 nations promised a new, less tough-sounding paragraph will feature in an expanded draft of the withdrawal agreement - expected to be published by the end of the month.

Commonwealth in secret succession plans Tax haven firms own 23,000 UK properties Official portraits of Obamas unveiled Speaking on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit and was not able to determine its own regulations when it came to trading with the rest of the world. He suggested the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters.

Ramaphosa to take over as SA presidentThe mineworker who became a business tycoon is set to achieve his dream of leading South Africa.16m17 minutes agoAfrica,"This video can not be played Cheers and song as Ramaphosa elected South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa has become South Africa's president a day after embattled leader Jacob Zuma resigned. He was the only candidate nominated by parliament, which is dominated by his African National Congress. MPs broke into song at the announcement. In his first presidential speech, Mr Ramaphosa, 65, said he would tackle the corruption which allegedly became widespread under Mr Zuma. The ANC had told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Mr Zuma faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. One allegation is that he allowed the wealthy Gupta family, to whom he has personal ties, to wield influence over policy, in an example of ""state capture"". An arrest warrant has been issued for Ajay Gupta, one of the three most prominent Gupta brothers, officials said on Thursday. This follows a raid by the Hawks, an elite police unit, on their home on Wednesday. The family has denied corruption allegations. Africa Live: Ramaphosa takes over Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president South African press applauds Zuma exit Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma President Ramaphosa told parliament that corruption and state capture were ""on our radar screen"". He is due to deliver a State of the Nation address on Friday. This was delayed last week amid uncertainty about who should deliver it and Mr Zuma's reluctance to step down. One opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, walked out of the parliamentary debate. It wants new elections, rather than the ANC deciding on the identity of the new president. Analysis: Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa: The long road to power It is often said that Mr Ramaphosa has had his eye on the position of president since the ANC came to power in 1994. The story goes that he was so upset at not having been chosen by Nelson Mandela as his successor that he left politics and went into business. But Mr Ramaphosa has now finally realised that dream. He has said his priority is reviving South Africa's battered economy. But it won't be easy: Unemployment is currently at almost 30%, a rate which rises to nearly 40% for young people. Low growth rates and dwindling investor confidence were compounded by two credit agencies downgrading the economy to junk status. One of the first steps in improving that investor confidence is addressing the persistent claims of corruption at the heart of government. What next for South Africa? Six reasons why Zuma quit Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out There is a renewed sense of hope as Mr Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy. The markets appeared to welcome Mr Zuma's resignation. The South African currency, the rand, reaching its strongest levels in three years - at 11.6570 rand for $1 in early trading. Some will miss him though, pointing to achievements like announcing the abolition of fees for higher education, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg. Mr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president. He led the country for more than a third of its time after apartheid. But he leaves office with several scandals hanging over him, and with South Africa's economy in dire straits. This video can not be played South Africans share their hopes for the future after Zuma's departure Shaun Abrahams, head of the National Prosecuting Authority, told Reuters news agency: ""I've been advised by my prosecuting team that Mr. Ajay Gupta is a fugitive from justice."" But eight other suspects did appear in court on Thursday on fraud and money laundering charges, local media report. The only member of the Gupta family to appear was Varun, who was Chief Operating Officer of the Gupta-owned mining firm Oakbay Resources and Energy. All eight told the court they had done nothing wrong.

"Steel pensions targeted by 'vultures'Government, regulators and ""financial vultures"" are criticised by an MPs' report into steel pensions.7h7 hours agoBusinessComments","British Steel pension scheme members were targeted by ""vulture"" financial advisers after Tata was allowed to offload its retirement fund, MPs say. In 2017 the Indian firm announced a restructuring of the Â£14bn fund to keep its UK loss-making operations afloat. But the government, Tata and regulators failed to protect 124,000 members from a ""major mis-selling scandal"", the Work and Pensions Select Committee said. The UK government has yet to issue its response to the ""neglect"" claim. The Pensions Regulator said it would continue to work to protect savers. The report from the Work and Pensions Select Committee was looking at the closure of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS). Regulators had accepted that Tata Steel UK would be insolvent if it continued to sponsor the scheme. About 8,000 people are employed by Tata across England and Wales, including 3,500 in Port Talbot, but those figures were dwarfed by number of retired steelworkers - more than 100,000 - who were members of the scheme. Those members had to decide what to do with their pension funds after the scheme was separated from Tata last September. Between October and December 2017, they had a choice of entering into a new Tata-backed scheme, BSPS2, or the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). Both were less generous than the scheme that closed but BSPS2 was better for the majority of people than the PPF. This video can not be played Frank Field MP: ""Pension holders were fleeced by financial vultures"" A third option was transferring out of the scheme completely - a so-called DB transfer - but the committee said this is ""not usually in someone's interests"". But circumstances surrounding the BSPS ""created perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"", the MPs concluded. OneTata worker told the BBChe lost almost Â£200,000 by transferring out of the BSPS after seeking independent financial advice. Last week, the scheme's trustees said that, since March 2017, it has processed 2,600 pension DB transfers with a total value of Â£1.1bn. The average amount transferred out was Â£400,000 and in around 20 cases the transfer value exceeded Â£1 million. This video can not be played Retired Port Talbot steelworker Tony Taylor said a minority of pensioners have been taken advantage of The committee noted that an outline plan to save Tata Steel UK, the ""sponsor"" of the BSPS, had been in place since May 2017. But it said those signatories to the deal - Tata, the UK government and Pensions Regulator - had neglected the pension scheme's members. Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""Once again we find the pensions regulator fiddling while Rome burns, when it should have seen this rip-off coming."" He added: ""All the responsible authorities must act, now, to stop more people being cheated."" Richard Bevan is one of the Tata workers who fears he has been targeted by ""financial vultures"" The financial advisers' regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also faces serious criticism for how it handled concerns over mis-selling. Other criticisms in the report were: Despite a ""surge in interest"" in DB transfers in April 2017, the FCA did not act until November, by which stage BSPS members were faced with a pressing deadline, creating ""perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"" A communication plan by BSPS was ""woefully inadequate"", under-resourced and unable to provide basic facts for members to make a complex choice. The report said it was the responsibility of the Pensions Regulator to ensure members were well-informed, but ""all this failed"" Around 25,000 scheme members did not make any choice, thought to include many very elderly or ill pensioners. These members will move into the PPF scheme. The report said the government had not implemented a system of ""deemed consent"" to ensure that any member who would have been obviously better off in BSPS2 would automatically be moved, and had not explained its decision. The report recommended the government should ensure deemed consent is in place for similar future deals ""Contingent charging"", where financial advisers are only paid for recommending a particular course of action, had led to members receiving poor advice. The government should ban contingent charging for all DB transfer advice.

Teenage girls' make-up racks up spending,"Girls start spending more than boys as they enter their teens and discover more expensive shampoo and make-up. At the ages of seven to nine, weekly spending is higher among boys (Â£8.50) than girls (Â£7.50), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Girls' spending then overtakes boys' at the age of 10 to 12 and accelerates in the 13 to 15 age group. While boys spent less than 10p a week on soap and cosmetics, girls spent Â£1.70 by the age of 13 to 15. But the figures also show that the teenagers spent less than they used to. In 2015-17, girls aged 13 to 15 spent an average of Â£20.20 a week, compared with Â£21.50 a week in 2002-04. Boys' spending dropped from Â£19.30 to Â£17.30 over the same period. The data is based on a diary of income and spending kept by children for the ONS over a two-week period. Grenfell Tower fire: Boy, 6, gives pocket money to victims 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' 'Children as young as 11 introduced to gambling' The ONS said that the factor that ""stood out"" when comparing spending among the older age groups was the amount paid for toiletries and cosmetics. This includes soap, shampoo and makeup. Only 2% of seven to 15-year-old boys bought at least one toiletry or cosmetic item in a two-week period, compared with 17% of girls of the same age. Girls aged seven to nine spent 20p a week on these items, rising to Â£1.70 for girls aged 13 to 15. Boys of all ages spent less than 10p a week. This video can not be played Dealing with debt: What do kids think about money? Other findings included: Girls spend double the amount a week (30p) on books than boys do, between the ages of seven and 15 The most was spent on clothes and shoes - nearly Â£1.80 a week Boys spent more than 10 times as much as girls on computer games and software (Â£1.10 compared with 10p a week) One of the most common buys for children aged seven to 15 years was soft drinks, including fizzy drinks More than half (56%) of these children bought at least one soft drink within a two-week period, with most being consumed away from the home. Ice cream was bought more frequently among pre-teen children. While spending has fallen compared with the previous generation, there remained some expensive items on the spending list, including bikes, mobile phones and computers.

Church of England issues Lent plastic tips,"Church of England worshippers have been issued with tips to cut plastic use The Church of England is urging Christians to give up single-use plastics during Lent, in a bid to cut the environmental damage it can cause. Worshippers have been offered tips to cut plastic use for each day up to Easter, such as choosing a fountain pen over a plastic ballpoint pen and buying music electronically rather than on CD. The Church linked it to a Christian calling to ""care for God's creation"". The calendar of tips has been sent to each of the Church's 42 dioceses. Each week of the Lent Plastic Challenge has a theme, for example food and drink, kitchen, clothing and travel. Tips include giving up throwaway plastic cups, using a bamboo toothbrush and buying bread that is not pre-packaged. Plastic bag charge 'worked overnight' at sea says skipper Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Church faces Â£1.5m bill after repeated thefts Other suggestions are to carry a set of non-plastic cutlery, place a ""no junk mail"" sticker on your letterbox and take your own toiletries to hotels rather than using the free travel size bottles. Ruth Knight, the Church's environmental policy officer, said: ""The Lent challenge is about raising our awareness of how much we rely on single-use plastics and challenging ourselves to see where we can reduce that use. ""It ties in closely with our calling as Christians to care for God's creation."" According to data from Plastics Europe, more than 300 million tonnes of plastic is produced globally each year. Non-profit organisation Plastic Oceans says 50% of all plastic produced is for single-use. A study published by scientists at the University of George in July last year estimated that 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been created since large-scale production started in the 1950s. But the majority of man-made plastics are not bio-degradable, meaning they will not rot. In addition, not all plastic can be recycled. For animals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of animals and can be potentially fatal. In a statement, the Diocese of London, added: ""David Attenborough has recently brought to everyone's attention the hideous damage being caused by our throwaway society to life in the oceans - where so much of our waste eventually ends up. ""This Lent let's give ocean creatures a better chance to renew themselves, free of our trash!"" The Church of England, which counts 1.1 million people among its worshipping community, is the latest organisation to take action to reduce single-use plastics after the issue was thrown into the spotlight by the BBC's Blue Planet II series, which aired last year. The BBCthis week said it would ban disposable plastics from its sites by 2020and the Queenalso backed efforts to reduce the material on royal estates. The Scottish Parliament also announced plans to ban plastic straws, following similar announcements by restaurants including Pizza Express, Wagamama and JD Wetherspoon. Lent lasts from Ash Wednesday until Easter Sunday, which this year falls on 1 April - a period of 40 days plus six Sundays. It marks the time Jesus went into the desert to fast and pray. Millions of Christians around the world mark Lent by fasting on certain days, giving up something that they enjoy or by making a new pledge. On Wednesday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Business Secretary Greg Clark were among 41 Conservative MPs who promised to use less single-use plastics during Lent.

He was the only candidate nominated by parliament, which is dominated by his African National Congress. MPs broke into song at the announcement. In his first presidential speech, Mr Ramaphosa, 65, said he would tackle the corruption which allegedly became widespread under Mr Zuma. The ANC had told Mr Zuma to step down or face a vote of no-confidence. Mr Zuma faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. One allegation is that he allowed the wealthy Gupta family, to whom he has personal ties, to wield influence over policy, in an example of ""state capture"". An arrest warrant has been issued for Ajay Gupta, one of the three most prominent Gupta brothers, officials said on Thursday. This follows a raid by the Hawks, an elite police unit, on their home on Wednesday. The family has denied corruption allegations. Africa Live: Ramaphosa takes over Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president South African press applauds Zuma exit Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma President Ramaphosa told parliament that corruption and state capture were ""on our radar screen"". He is due to deliver a State of the Nation address on Friday. This was delayed last week amid uncertainty about who should deliver it and Mr Zuma's reluctance to step down. One opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, walked out of the parliamentary debate. It wants new elections, rather than the ANC deciding on the identity of the new president. Analysis: Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa: The long road to power It is often said that Mr Ramaphosa has had his eye on the position of president since the ANC came to power in 1994. The story goes that he was so upset at not having been chosen by Nelson Mandela as his successor that he left politics and went into business. But Mr Ramaphosa has now finally realised that dream. He has said his priority is reviving South Africa's battered economy. But it won't be easy: Unemployment is currently at almost 30%, a rate which rises to nearly 40% for young people. Low growth rates and dwindling investor confidence were compounded by two credit agencies downgrading the economy to junk status. One of the first steps in improving that investor confidence is addressing the persistent claims of corruption at the heart of government. What next for South Africa? Six reasons why Zuma quit Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out There is a renewed sense of hope as Mr Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy. The markets appeared to welcome Mr Zuma's resignation. The South African currency, the rand, reaching its strongest levels in three years - at 11.6570 rand for $1 in early trading. Some will miss him though, pointing to achievements like announcing the abolition of fees for higher education, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg. Mr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president. He led the country for more than a third of its time after apartheid. But he leaves office with several scandals hanging over him, and with South Africa's economy in dire straits. This video can not be played South Africans share their hopes for the future after Zuma's departure Shaun Abrahams, head of the National Prosecuting Authority, told Reuters news agency: ""I've been advised by my prosecuting team that Mr. Ajay Gupta is a fugitive from justice."" But eight other suspects did appear in court on Thursday on fraud and money laundering charges, local media report. The only member of the Gupta family to appear was Varun, who was Chief Operating Officer of the Gupta-owned mining firm Oakbay Resources and Energy. All eight told the court they had done nothing wrong.

China demands online quiz clampdown,"China has called for a clampdown on online quiz shows which have surged in popularity in recent months. The country's media and publication regulator said there was ""vulgar and tawdry"" content in some of the quizzes. Companies should avoid promoting extravagance or sensationalism and focus on spreading ""healthy, beneficial knowledge"", it added. On some occasions, up to six million people have been logged in to play an individual quiz. At least two of the leading apps are now displaying messages saying that their quizzes are being halted temporarily. The games tend to follow the same format as quizzes such as HQ Trivia, which has become very popular in the US. Played on smartphones in real time, they are free to enter and anyone can download the many quiz apps which have popped up. Hosted live by a real quizmaster, competitors have to answer a series of multiple-choice questions. You typically only get ten seconds to respond (presumably to try and limit cheating). And getting an answer wrong means you're out. Those remaining at the end of the quiz share the prize money. Prize money is shared among many, many, many winners Rival companies have tried to out-do each other to attract players, leading to an escalation in prize money. In January, quiz app Chongding Dahui (which roughly translates as ""the race to the top"") started offering a prize of 100,000 yuan (Â£11,240; $15,750) for its nightly quiz. That prompted others to weigh in with even bigger prizes - and so far billions of yuan have been up for grabs. But, because so many people are playing each quiz, there are often tens or hundreds of thousands of winners, meaning the payout can be relatively small. Winnings are usually sent directly to WeChat or Alipay accounts - the two dominant digital payments businesses in China. By BBC Beijing Staff Money plays a big role in the popularity of these real-time quizzes. If you get a little luck, you can earn about 15 yuan (Â£1.70; $2.36) per hour - which is more than what some part-time jobs pay in China.  So for some people, especially in the smaller Chinese cities and villages, it's a way to earn money. But others say the quizzes give them a sense of achievement. Because the questions are varied and random, better-educated people may lose to those less-educated, and kids might beat grown-ups.  And people can - and do - show off their scores on social media. The quiz craze builds on the popularity of China's live-stream apps. Those streams have become a major source of entertainment for people in less-developed regions who have plenty of leisure time but little money to spend, or places to spend it. And when those videos began to get boring, lively quizzes reignited the excitement. While there are questions about poetry, literature and history, not all are so serious. There's celebrity gossip in there too - and it's those sorts of quizzes which seem to have prompted concerns that the public is not being educated but instead, being misled. The most high-profile quizzes are run by the likes of search giant Baidu, e-retailer Alibaba, video game maker NetEase, news feed platform Toutiao and the son of Dalian Wanda founder Wang Jianlin, Wang Sicong. In other words, they're all no strangers to making money. To make the quizzes sustainable, the firms running the apps are recruiting advertisers and sponsorship. Much like with primetime television, adverts are shown throughout the broadcast. And of course the tech firms hope that users will come for the quizzes, then hang around and use other services. But not all of them are convinced it is more than a fad. ""If you ask me why I do this, to be honest, I don't really know if I can make money,"" said Zhou Hongyi, chairman of Qihoo, another company involved in quiz apps. ""But from a user's perspective, I think this is really fun."" A big challenge for the quiz providers is ensuring they don't attract the attention of government censors. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television issued a notice saying some quizzes were essentially, click-bait, and described content as  ""vulgar and tawdry"". It added that ""extravagance or sensationalism"" should not be promoted and that ""mammonism"" - meaning the greedy pursuit of riches - must not be encouraged. Excessive marketing during shows was also banned, the regulator said. Instead, quizzes should encourage ""healthy, beneficial knowledge that promoted core socialist values"" the notice said. Meanwhile anchors who host the quizzes need to have ""proper qualifications and be morally upstanding"". The new guidance comes amid a broader crackdown on online content. Beijing has run an official campaign against internet addiction, and the country hasseen a shut down of livestreaming sitesand blogs.

Organ donations rising across the UKIt comes as the NHS runs a public consultation into whether England should introduce an opt-out scheme.2h2 hours agoHealth,"A record 170 organ donations took place across the UK in January, resulting in more than 400 life-saving transplants. The rise in numbers comes as the NHS is running a public consultation into whether England should follow Wales and introduce an opt-out donation scheme. The online consultation has so far had more than 11,000 responses; a huge amount bearing in mind similar surveys usually attract a few hundred replies. The NHS's Claire Williment said: ""It has got the nation talking."" Mrs Williment, head of transplant development for NHS blood and transplant (NHSBT), said this was ""a positive thing"". Anthony Clarkson, assistant director of organ donation and nursing at NHS Blood and Transplant said: ""January was by far the busiest month on record for organ donation thanks to 170 very special individuals. ""Thanks to the generosity of organ donors and the support of their families, people in desperate need of a transplant are getting a second chance at life,"" he added. The 12-week consultation, which runs until 6 March,asks people their views on three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative's decision to donate their organs? when would exemptions to opt out be needed and what safeguards will be necessary? how might a new system affect certain groups depending on age, disability, race or faith? Under the current system in England, people who want to donate their organs opt in by signing up as a donor on the NHS organ donor register and telling their family their decision. If a decision has not been recorded at the time of a person's death, hospital staff will consult family members on whether organ donation should go ahead. Of the 600,000 people who died in the UK between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017, only 5,681 were eligible donors, but after donation requests were made to families only 1,413 became donors. Families are always consulted before a donation takes place and 91% of them agree to it if their relative is on the organ donation register (ODR), according to figures from the NHSBT potential donor audit. However, when patients are not on the ODR then 47% of families say no to a donation. On average, one organ donor contributes to three transplants but it is possible for their organs or tissue to be used in up to nine people. One option for the future in the consultation is for a person's donation decision to be respected after their death, without their family being asked. However, Mrs Williment said any decision on a change like that would be down to the Department of Health. 'UK should follow Wales' lead on organ donation' Organ donation: Three stories of hope Organ donation: Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Dr Dale Gardiner, deputy national clinical lead for organ donation and intensive care consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said that donation should be considered to be ""a fundamental part of end of life care"". He added: ""It is the most humbling moment of my career in intensive care when a family look beyond their grief and say yes to donation. ""The worst moment is when families do not know their loved one's wishes,"" he added. Wales introduced an opt-out system in December 2015with adults regarded as having consented to organ donation unless they have opted out. When it started, more than one million people - 34% of the population - registered to opt in with 86,000 opting out. However, a study published last December, two years into the scheme,showed that it had not increased the number of donors in the country. NHSBT figures show that donor numbers in the UK have increased in all but one of the past 10 years, while the number of people on the transplant waiting list has decreased every year since 2009-10. Keith Rigg, consultant transplant surgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, admitted that opt-out may not be the way to raise the number of donors in England even higher. He felt that full results from Wales should be studied before such a move was considered in England. ""There is no clear evidence that this has resulted in an increase in organ donations and transplants where it has been introduced,"" he said. ""There do appear to be higher rates in countries where there this has been brought in but many other factors muddy the waters. ""For example, in the three European countries with the highest organ donation rate - Spain, Croatia and Portugal - the reason is down to [other] changes,"" he explained. About 80% of transplant patients are waiting to receive a new kidney. Fiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK, said: ""One person dies every day whilst waiting for a kidney transplant; it is abundantly clear that we need to review our current system now to stop this continuing."" Last June, the Scottish governmentsaid it would bring forward legislation to provide an opt-out system. However in October,a leading transplant surgeon in Northern Ireland said the province was ""not ready""for such a system to be introduced. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, senators in the Netherlands approved the introduction of an opt-out scheme in their country.

Church of England issues Lent plastic tipsSuggestions include swapping plastic ballpoint pens for fountain pens and using a bamboo toothbrush.,"Church of England worshippers have been issued with tips to cut plastic use The Church of England is urging Christians to give up single-use plastics during Lent, in a bid to cut the environmental damage it can cause. Worshippers have been offered tips to cut plastic use for each day up to Easter, such as choosing a fountain pen over a plastic ballpoint pen and buying music electronically rather than on CD. The Church linked it to a Christian calling to ""care for God's creation"". The calendar of tips has been sent to each of the Church's 42 dioceses. Each week of the Lent Plastic Challenge has a theme, for example food and drink, kitchen, clothing and travel. Tips include giving up throwaway plastic cups, using a bamboo toothbrush and buying bread that is not pre-packaged. Plastic bag charge 'worked overnight' at sea says skipper Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Church faces Â£1.5m bill after repeated thefts Other suggestions are to carry a set of non-plastic cutlery, place a ""no junk mail"" sticker on your letterbox and take your own toiletries to hotels rather than using the free travel size bottles. Ruth Knight, the Church's environmental policy officer, said: ""The Lent challenge is about raising our awareness of how much we rely on single-use plastics and challenging ourselves to see where we can reduce that use. ""It ties in closely with our calling as Christians to care for God's creation."" According to data from Plastics Europe, more than 300 million tonnes of plastic is produced globally each year. Non-profit organisation Plastic Oceans says 50% of all plastic produced is for single-use. A study published by scientists at the University of George in July last year estimated that 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been created since large-scale production started in the 1950s. But the majority of man-made plastics are not bio-degradable, meaning they will not rot. In addition, not all plastic can be recycled. For animals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of animals and can be potentially fatal. In a statement, the Diocese of London, added: ""David Attenborough has recently brought to everyone's attention the hideous damage being caused by our throwaway society to life in the oceans - where so much of our waste eventually ends up. ""This Lent let's give ocean creatures a better chance to renew themselves, free of our trash!"" The Church of England, which counts 1.1 million people among its worshipping community, is the latest organisation to take action to reduce single-use plastics after the issue was thrown into the spotlight by the BBC's Blue Planet II series, which aired last year. The BBCthis week said it would ban disposable plastics from its sites by 2020and the Queenalso backed efforts to reduce the material on royal estates. The Scottish Parliament also announced plans to ban plastic straws, following similar announcements by restaurants including Pizza Express, Wagamama and JD Wetherspoon. Lent lasts from Ash Wednesday until Easter Sunday, which this year falls on 1 April - a period of 40 days plus six Sundays. It marks the time Jesus went into the desert to fast and pray. Millions of Christians around the world mark Lent by fasting on certain days, giving up something that they enjoy or by making a new pledge. On Wednesday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Business Secretary Greg Clark were among 41 Conservative MPs who promised to use less single-use plastics during Lent.

UK: Russia behind 'malicious' cyber-attack,"The Russian military was directly behind a ""malicious"" cyber-attack on Ukraine that spread globally last year, the US and Britain have said. The White House said June's NotPetya ransomware attack caused billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was ""ripping up the rule book"" and the UK would respond. Moscow denies being behind the attack, calling such claims ""Russophobic"". Ransomware, which threatens to delete the target's files unless they pay a ransom, is regarded as the fastest growing form of computer virus. Defence secretary warns of Russian plot UK security chief blames Russia for hacks Facebook in new Russian Brexit vote probe May accuses Putin of election meddling Experts believe about 2,000 NotPetya attacks were launched, mainly aimed at Ukraine. The country Ukraine has been locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. In the NotPetya attack, businesses with strong trade links with Ukraine, such as the UK's Reckitt Benckiser, Dutch delivery firm TNT and Danish shipping giant Maersk were affected. The attack is estimated to have cost companies more than $1.2bn (Â£850m). This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Reckitt Benckiser - maker of Dettol, Durex and Strepsils - said the attack disrupted its manufacturing output and shipping capacity for up to two months. On Thursday the UK government took the unusual step of publicly accusing the Russia military of being behind the attack. ""The UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" the foreign office said in a statement. Later, the White House also pointed the finger at Russia. ""In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,"" a statement said. ""This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber attack that will be met with international consequences."" Russia, however, said the claims were ""groundless"" and that Russian businesses were among those whose systems were affected.

Organ donations rising across the UK,"A record 170 organ donations took place across the UK in January, resulting in more than 400 life-saving transplants. The rise in numbers comes as the NHS is running a public consultation into whether England should follow Wales and introduce an opt-out donation scheme. The online consultation has so far had more than 11,000 responses; a huge amount bearing in mind similar surveys usually attract a few hundred replies. The NHS's Claire Williment said: ""It has got the nation talking."" Mrs Williment, head of transplant development for NHS blood and transplant (NHSBT), said this was ""a positive thing"". Anthony Clarkson, assistant director of organ donation and nursing at NHS Blood and Transplant said: ""January was by far the busiest month on record for organ donation thanks to 170 very special individuals. ""Thanks to the generosity of organ donors and the support of their families, people in desperate need of a transplant are getting a second chance at life,"" he added. The 12-week consultation, which runs until 6 March,asks people their views on three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative's decision to donate their organs? when would exemptions to opt out be needed and what safeguards will be necessary? how might a new system affect certain groups depending on age, disability, race or faith? Under the current system in England, people who want to donate their organs opt in by signing up as a donor on the NHS organ donor register and telling their family their decision. If a decision has not been recorded at the time of a person's death, hospital staff will consult family members on whether organ donation should go ahead. Of the 600,000 people who died in the UK between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017, only 5,681 were eligible donors, but after donation requests were made to families only 1,413 became donors. Families are always consulted before a donation takes place and 91% of them agree to it if their relative is on the organ donation register (ODR), according to figures from the NHSBT potential donor audit. However, when patients are not on the ODR then 47% of families say no to a donation. On average, one organ donor contributes to three transplants but it is possible for their organs or tissue to be used in up to nine people. One option for the future in the consultation is for a person's donation decision to be respected after their death, without their family being asked. However, Mrs Williment said any decision on a change like that would be down to the Department of Health. 'UK should follow Wales' lead on organ donation' Organ donation: Three stories of hope Organ donation: Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Dr Dale Gardiner, deputy national clinical lead for organ donation and intensive care consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said that donation should be considered to be ""a fundamental part of end of life care"". He added: ""It is the most humbling moment of my career in intensive care when a family look beyond their grief and say yes to donation. ""The worst moment is when families do not know their loved one's wishes,"" he added. Wales introduced an opt-out system in December 2015with adults regarded as having consented to organ donation unless they have opted out. When it started, more than one million people - 34% of the population - registered to opt in with 86,000 opting out. However, a study published last December, two years into the scheme,showed that it had not increased the number of donors in the country. NHSBT figures show that donor numbers in the UK have increased in all but one of the past 10 years, while the number of people on the transplant waiting list has decreased every year since 2009-10. Keith Rigg, consultant transplant surgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, admitted that opt-out may not be the way to raise the number of donors in England even higher. He felt that full results from Wales should be studied before such a move was considered in England. ""There is no clear evidence that this has resulted in an increase in organ donations and transplants where it has been introduced,"" he said. ""There do appear to be higher rates in countries where there this has been brought in but many other factors muddy the waters. ""For example, in the three European countries with the highest organ donation rate - Spain, Croatia and Portugal - the reason is down to [other] changes,"" he explained. About 80% of transplant patients are waiting to receive a new kidney. Fiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK, said: ""One person dies every day whilst waiting for a kidney transplant; it is abundantly clear that we need to review our current system now to stop this continuing."" Last June, the Scottish governmentsaid it would bring forward legislation to provide an opt-out system. However in October,a leading transplant surgeon in Northern Ireland said the province was ""not ready""for such a system to be introduced. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, senators in the Netherlands approved the introduction of an opt-out scheme in their country.

Rich and poor life expectancy gap widens,"The life expectancy gap between England's richest and poorest neighbourhoods has widened since 2001, a report says. On average, a boy born in one of the most affluent areas will outlive one born in one of the poorest by 8.4 years. That was up from 7.2 years in 2001, the Longevity Science Panel (LSP) found. The government said it was tackling the issue, and added cancer survival rates were ""at an all-time high"". The LSP report said the results were concerning and required further investigation to understand the causes. But its authors said income inequality was the biggest factor. Rich and poor lifespan gap 'widening' Life expectancy rises 'grinding to halt' The LSP looked at data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2015. This divides England into 33,000 residential areas which are rated on a range of factors, such as income levels, health, education and crime. It found that death rates for 60 to 89-year-olds had improved for all socio-economic groups between 2001 and 2015, but the biggest gains were recorded among the most well-off. The result is that men and women in that age group, who were from the least advantaged fifth of the country, are now about 80% more likely than those from the most advantaged fifth to die in any given year, it said. In 2001 the higher chance of older people dying if they lived in a poor area, compared to a wealthy one, was lower at just 52% for men and 41% for women. Dame Karen Dunnell, chair of the LSP, said: ""Dying earlier if you are poor is the most unfair outcome of all, so we should all be concerned about the growing divergence in rich-poor life expectancy. ""To reduce the risk of further widening, we need better understanding of the precise causes, followed by co-ordinated policy initiatives across health, work, welfare, pension and housing to improve outcomes for all,"" she added. The study also found: Girls born in the top fifth of areas on average live 5.8 years longer than those born in the bottom 20% - up from a five-year gap in 2001 For a 60-year-old man the difference is five years - up from 4.1 in 2001 For women of the same age it is 4.2 years - up from 3.1 The report also found there had been a slowing down in the long-standing trend for improvement in mortality rates, for all groups since 2011, which it said could be linked to cuts to public spending in the NHS and social care sector. Differences in income, smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption, as well as different rates of uptake of preventive health services and treatment rates for diseases, could explain the difference in life expectancy across socio-economic groups, it said. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Health inequality is a challenging and complex area, but we are committed to tackling this issue. ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high and smoking rates are at an all-time low, but we know there is still too much variation."" They added Â£16bn is being invested in local government public health services. The LSP was set up by the insurance provider Legal and General to look at how various factors affect life expectancy.

Australia PM bans minister-staff sex,"Barnaby Joyce will take one week of leave, Malcolm Turnbull says Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has said he will prohibit sex between ministers and their staff, after it was revealed his deputy had an affair with a former staffer. In a press briefing, he condemned Barnaby Joyce for a ""shocking error of judgement"". Mr Joyce will take a leave of absence from Monday amid scrutiny over whether he breached ministerial standards. Both Mr Joyce and Mr Turnbull deny that any rules, as defined, were broken. But the prime minister said he would overhaul the ""truly deficient"" ministerial code of conduct. ""Ministers must behave accordingly. They must not have sexual relations with their staff - that's it,"" he told reporters. Mr Turnbull earlier told parliament that Mr Joyce would not fill his post as acting leader next week when the prime minister travels to the US. The scandal has dominated Australian politics since last Wednesday when Mr Joyce's affair with media adviser Vikki Campion was publicly revealed. How the Barnaby Joyce scandal unfolded Mr Turnbull said Mr Joyce would be on leave for a week from Monday. Opposition parties called on him to resign. The high-profile conservative had only returned to parliament in December after brieflylosing his job over his New Zealand dual citizenship. Mr Turnbull said his deputy had caused ""terrible hurt and humiliation"" to his estranged wife, Natalie Joyce, their four daughters, and Ms Campion. ""Barnaby made a shocking error of judgement in having an affair with a young woman working in his office,"" he said. ""In doing so he has set off a world of woe for those women, and appalled all of us. Our hearts go out to them."" Malcolm Turnbull said the new rules covered those ""married and single"" On Tuesday, Mr Joyce publicly apologised to all six for what he called a ""searing personal experience"". Mr Turnbull said such behaviour was not acceptable ""today, in 2018"", and ministers must oversee respectful workplaces. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent It's unlike Barnaby Joyce to step away from the front line. He's a hardened battler who normally revels in the noisy confrontation of politics. Mr Joyce is the man who took on Johnny Depp, a man he called a ""dipstick"", and won; the politician who survived the citizenship row and was re-elected with an increased majority. The man in the Akubra hat was riding high until his extramarital affair was exposed and he lost authority within his own party. With the storm around him showing no sign of slowing, Mr Joyce will hope his impromptu holiday can somehow calm matters. But his opponents are unlikely to stop sniping, just because he's taken cover. On Thursday, the Senate passed a motion calling on Mr Joyce to resign - although it has no power to force such a move. Mr Joyce has faced questions over the timing of two unadvertised jobs within his party that were taken up by Ms Campion last year. Under the code of conduct, Mr Turnbull must approve any ministerial department job given to the partner of a frontbencher. No permission was sought for Ms Campion. However, both Mr Joyce and Mr Turnbull maintain that Ms Campion was not the deputy prime minister's partner at the time. Mr Joyce was due to step in as acting prime minister while Mr Turnbull is on his trip to the US, in line with usual convention. The role will instead be taken up by Mathias Cormann, the government's leader in the Senate.

Sinn Fein to meet Irish and UK governmentsSinn FÃ©in says it will meet both the Irish and UK governments after power-sharing talks collapsed.23m23 minutes agoNorthern Ireland,"On Wednesday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process Sinn FÃ©in has said it will meet both the Irish and UK governments on Thursday to discuss thelatest failed bid to restore power sharing. The talks ended on Wednesday after the DUP declared there was ""no current prospect"" of a deal. Both parties had been in negotiations in a bid to end the13-month stalemate at Stormont. Arlene Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language She said that Sinn FÃ©in's ""insistence on a stand-alone Irish Language Act means that we have reached an impasse"". The party's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process. Speaking to the BBC's Talkback programme, Shaun Woodward, former Labour NI secretary, said the situation ""genuinely poses real risks for the future of peace in Northern Ireland"". Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know He said: ""Theresa May risked everything when she decided to do a deal with the DUP, it was a catastrophic error of judgement to try to play with the politics of Northern Ireland by dabbling in what is a very fragile ecosystem."" One possible outcome of the talks impasse is a return to direct rule in Northern Ireland. What is direct rule? However, Deputy Irish Prime Minister Simon Coveney told RTÃ on Thursday ""the Irish government is not going to be allowing  a situation where we move easily into direct rule"". Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the DUP's statement on Wednesday was ""very depressing"". ""We were working on the basis that accommodation had been reached,"" he said. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017 ""We were expecting the DUP to go off and close the deal in relation to that, but they didn't do it. ""So, we want to talk to the two governments today, and I don't doubt we will be in touch with the other parties to see where this goes from here,"" he added. The DUP MP Gregory Campbell said a ""narrative"" came to light over the weekend that there was a ""possibility of a deal - despite us privately and publicly saying that if there was, it couldn't include an Irish Language Act"". ""Now, where the future has to lie is in trying to pick up the pieces and see if agreement is doable,"" he said. Karen Bradley said she believed ""the basis for an accommodation still exists"" ""We are going to have to get the budget passed next week, then we're going to have to clear the air, and get back as political parties at some point in the future. ""One thing I agree with Sinn FÃ©in, they said - 'these issues aren't going away' - and they are right. ""But what they also need to understand, is neither are we."" Analysis: Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI political correspondent Picking up the pieces after another failed talks process is not where both governments expected to be. But, they will now have to plot the next move after negotiations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in broke down on Wednesday. The parties have clashed over who was to blame. Sinn FÃ©in will set out its response to the collapse after meeting both governments. While the DUP have made it clear they want Westminster to take charge and legislate for a budget, it is now up to London and Dublin to decide how the talks process can be salvaged. When asked about the prospect of direct rule from Westminster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said any potential future governance of Northern Ireland would require ""strong"" involvement of the Irish government. ""The rest of us cannot be left at the whim of Sammy Wilson, or Ian Paisley Junior or Gregory Campbell,"" he said. ""That just cannot be allowed to happen."" Meanwhile, the Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it was a ""very, very sad day for Northern Ireland, the institutions and the people of Northern Ireland"". She added: ""It is a crying shame we are sitting here in the wake of yesterday's chaos, looking at a budget being imposed from Westminster, rather than engaging in the difficult job that is governing Northern Ireland ourselves."" Arlene Foster announced the talks had ended on Wednesday Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann has called for the publication of any progress made between the two large parties ""so the people of Northern Ireland can see where the finishing point was"". Despite Wednesday's announcement from the DUP, the Northern Ireland secretary signalled that a deal remained possible. ""I believe the basis for an accommodation still exists,"" said Karen Bradley. However, she is expected to come under pressure to legislate for budget at Westminster. The Shadow Secretary of State Owen Smith told the BBC it was ""enormously disappointing"" that the talks collapsed and called for ""some clarity"" to be provided about ""where progress was made, and where agreement was possible"". ""I don't think it's good enough, frankly, to continue with this veil of secrecy with people unable to be certain about where there was agreement or where there wasn't,"" he added.

Driving bans for children as young as 12One teenager describes driving at speeds of 135mph when he was under age.,"This video can not be played 'Mikey' illegally started driving when he was 16 years old More than 1,000 driving bans were issued in 2017 to children not legally old enough to be behind the wheel. The number of disqualifications for children aged 16 and under rose to 1,024 last year, compared with 696 in 2014, according to DVLA figures. Children as young as 12 were among those banned, with 33 disqualifications issued in total during 2017 for those aged 13 and under. Motoring group the RAC described the figures as ""the tip of the iceberg"". The statistics were given to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. Clockwise from top left: Anthony Armour, Darnell Harte, Robbie Meerun, Elliot and Ellis Thornton-Kimmit were all killed in a crash in Meanwood, Leeds A 15-year-old boy caused the deaths of five people in Leedsin November when he crashed a stolen car into a tree after reaching speeds of 88mph. The teenager, who cannot be named due to his age, admitted five counts of causing death by dangerous driving and was detained for four and a half years. Elise Dhers, whose 15-year-old brother Darnell Harte was killed in the crash, is calling for tougher tariffs for perpetrators. She said: ""The judge should have said 'I'm going to set an example, I'm going to teach young boys or girls who feel it's OK to steal a car that there are consequences for their actions'."" Currently, UK courts can impose driving bans on those who are legally too young to drive.  Once they have turned 17 and their disqualification period ends, they will be able to drive again. Penalty points would still be listed on any licence issued and could lead to an increased ban if another offence is committed. One teenager from Bradford, who wanted to be known as Mikey, described how at aged 16 he and his friends would ""chip in"" up to Â£500 to pay an adult to obtain them a car. ""I've been in a police chase but we got away because we went into these streets and the [patrol] car couldn't get into these little streets. The police had to go over the kerbs slowly and that's when we got away,"" the 18-year-old said. ""The highest speed I did was 135mph, I was putting people in danger. If I hit someone, that's someone else's family that I'm destroying - it's not worth it."" ""Mikey"" said he had been involved in a police chase while driving under age RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""It presents such a danger to every other road user, because they're not only driving without a licence, they don't have insurance. ""No doubt this is the tip of the iceberg because they have to be caught breaking the law and inevitably many will be getting away scot-free."" He added the number of roads policing officers had been cut by about 27% since 2010, so ""the chances of getting caught are far lower"". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said they were committed to courts having sufficient powers to deal with driving offences. It added: ""We will bring forward proposals for changes in the law as soon as parliamentary time allows. ""These proposals will take account of, and incorporate, all of government's proposals for safer roads, including the Department of Transport's review of cycle safety.""

Zuma bows to party pressure and quits,"This video can not be played Mr Zuma said he was resigning ""with immediate effect"" South Africa's embattled President Jacob Zuma has resigned after intense pressure from his own party. In a televised statement he said he was quitting with immediate effect but said he disagreed with his ANC party's decision. The ANC had told him to step down or face a vote of no confidence in parliament. The 75-year-old has been facing calls to give way to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's new leader. Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, faces numerous allegations of corruption. Earlier on Wednesday, police swooped on the Johannesburg home of the powerful and wealthy Gupta family with whom Mr Zuma has close ties. Jacob Zuma: The survivor whose nine lives ran out How Zuma's presidency shaped SA speech What next for South Africa? He began his speech by laughing and joking with members of the press, asking them why they looked so serious. After paying tribute to those whom he had worked with over the years, Mr Zuma said that violence and division within the ANC had influenced his decision to step down. ""No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name. I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect,"" he said. ""Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC. ""As I leave I will continue to serve the people of South Africa as well as the ANC, the organisation I have served... all of my life."" Analysis by Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg The resignation of president Jacob Zuma marks the end of an era. An era of one corruption allegation after another. An era of divisions, infighting and public squabbles. There are many people who are celebrating now, and not just from the opposition benches. Some of President Zuma's fiercest political foes came from his own ANC party. Comrades who fought white minority rule in the same trenches as he did, could not wait to see his back. He is gone now. There is a renewed sense of hope as Cyril Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy. Some will miss him though, pointing to achievements like announcing free fees for higher education. The ANC's Jesse Duarte summed up the mood for many supporters of Mr Zuma's when she said ""this is a very painful moment"". The ANC (African National Congress) issued a statement saying Mr Zuma's resignation provided ""certainty to the people of South Africa"". Deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte told reporters: ""President Zuma remains a principled member of the ANC. The ANC wants to salute the outstanding contribution he has made."" Mr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president. He led the country for more than a third of its time after apartheid. But he leaves office with several scandals hanging over him, and with South Africa's economy in dire straits. This video can not be played The rise and fall of Jacob Zuma A meeting of the ANC's National Executive Committee had announced its decision to recall Mr Zuma on Tuesday and gave him until the end of Wednesday to resign. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu then announced a parliamentary motion of no-confidence for Thursday, with Mr Ramaphosa sworn in as president as soon as possible after that. Mr Zuma's resignation capped a day of fast-moving events. It began with early morning police raids and arrests at the Johannesburg home of his close associates, the wealthy, Indian-born Gupta family. The Gupta family's walled compound in Johannesburg was sealed off during the police raid The Guptas have been accused of using their close friendship with the president to wield enormous political influence.

The talks ended on Wednesday after the DUP declared there was ""no current prospect"" of a deal. Both parties had been in negotiations in a bid to end the13-month stalemate at Stormont.

Moped-aided thefts rise in shop hotspots,"This video can not be played The London streets most affected by ride-by moped thefts Ride-by moped thefts and robberies on London's main shopping streets have increased six-fold over the last two years. Met Police data shows Oxford Street is the worst hit with 291 offences in one year - up from 13 in 2014-15. A criminology expert said moped-enabled theft is the ""crime of the moment"" as it is ""ridiculously easy"" to do. Oxford Street's crowds give thieves cover and there are plenty of ""rich pickings"" to choose from, he added. Porn star 'free to discuss' Trump story Transgender first for Australian football Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer' Regent Street saw the number of thefts jump from three to 91 between 2015 and 2017, while Bond Street went from one to 14. Supt Mark Payne, from the Met, said ""intensive operations"" in the West End have led to a decrease in moped-enabled crime since October 2017. A criminology expert said 'nowadays people are phone zombies' and unaware of their surroundings Oxford, Regent and Bond Street combined have 200 million visitors a year. Upper Street, Kings Road and Marylebone High Street were the other central shopping destinations most affected. Many offenders travel in pairs on one moped so the passenger can grab items out of the victims' hands as they drive past. Dr Simon Harding, associate professor of criminology at the University of West London, said the rise in these crimes could be because phones are more valuable than they used to be, and are an easy item to steal because people use them so much. ""If you look at mobile phones five years ago, they were pretty much in our pockets unless we got a phone call,"" he said. ""Nowadays people are phone zombies. They are on their phone walking along the street, bumping into people, not knowing where they are going."" Offenders are also motivated by the fact they will not have to pay to get the phone unlocked if they can grab it while it is in use, he said. Gloria Matuba, a 23-year-old charity worker, was targeted on her way to catch a bus home from work near Old Street, in Islington, in December 2016. ""I was on the phone to my friend, having a chit-chat as you do, and not really paying attention,"" she said. ""The way it happened, it was so quick. They came up behind me, they mounted the pavement. ""I thought someone was nudging into me but actually they'd taken my phone."" Ms Matuba said she was left ""paranoid and hysterical"" after the theft, which did not lead to any convictions - and that the increase in the crimes ""doesn't make me feel safe at all"". ""Fair enough, I lost my phone, but we've seen that they actually hurt people,"" she said. Thousands of people in London have been victims of these crimes,including former chancellor George Osborne. Of the 848 moped-enabled thefts, robberies and burglaries recorded in 14 major retail spots in the capital since November 2014, 79% were theft or attempted theft of personal property. Dr Harding said the ""culture"" that moped offenders are a part of means they will be armed. ""You'd be a fool to think they weren't,"" he added. Earlier this month a 22-year-old man was stabbed after he chased down a moped passenger who snatched his phone out of his hand on Oxford Street. Police are developing tactics to tackle the crime surge, such as using remote controlled spikes to puncture suspects' tyres. Supt Payne added: ""Offenders rely on the unwariness of the public to snatch their phones while they make calls so it is important [to be aware] at all times, particularly when emerging from a train or underground station."" Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, said she plans to ""stamp out"" the ""reckless and intimidating"" offences, with help from the Met. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company - which represents high-end traders on Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street - added: ""We will continue to work with public services to investigate these incidents and ensure our district remains secure for everyone.""

Zimbabwe opposition leader Tsvangirai diesThe head of the MDC was for decades a strong opponent of former President Robert Mugabe.8h8 hours agoAfrica,"This video can not be played Morgan Tsvangirai was best known for challenging Robert Mugabe Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has died in South Africa, a senior official in his MDC party has said. Mr Tsvangirai, 65, a former prime minister, had reportedly been suffering from colon cancer. ""He died this evening. The family communicated this to me,"" MDC vice president Elias Mudzuri told Reuters. Mr Tsvangirai's career was marked by a long political struggle against former President Robert Mugabe. He had been beaten and imprisoned numerous times. Obituary: Morgan Tsvangirai Announcing Mr Tsvangirai's death, Mr Mudzuri said on Twitter that the MDC had ""lost our icon and fighter for democracy"". Mr Tsvangirai founded the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) in 2000, repeatedly challenging Mr Mugabe during the ex-president's long grip on power. By Joseph Winter, BBC News online Africa Editor Morgan Tsvangirai was an incredibly brave man who risked his life to stand up to the authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe. He did not succeed in ousting Mr Mugabe - due to the intimidation of his supporters and some blatant rigging - but he did at least live to see the downfall of his long-time rival. Although he was obviously very sick, he even travelled home from South Africa, where he was being treated, for the occasion. But in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe always managed to get the better of the charismatic former union leader - especially when he was prime minister and they were supposedly sharing power. Some of his ex-comrades in the MDC, which he founded, accused him of dictatorial tendencies and the party split several times. Now, the MDC will have the formidable task of trying to unite and mount a credible challenge to Mr Mugabe's successor Emmerson Mnangagwa in this year's elections. In the 2008 election, Mr Tsvangirai gained the most votes in the first round but not enough to win outright. Before the second round of voting, Mr Mugabe's security forces carried out a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, and Mr Tsvangirai withdrew. Mr Mugabe was declared the winner, but an international outcry over allegations of violence and vote-rigging led to a power sharing agreement in which Mr Tsvangirai would serve as prime minister. Mr Tsvangirai ran against Mr Mugabe again in 2013 but lost by a landslide. The MDC is said to be divided over who should lead it into elections later this year against the governing Zanu-PF party, led by Mr Mugabe's successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Florida shooting: A survivor's story,"David Hogg, 17, was in a science class when the first shots rang out at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School It was 14:30 when David Hogg heard the first shot. The 17-year-old was in environmental science class at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida. The teacher had just passed out worksheets. When he heard the bang, his classmates turned to each other. That sounded like a gun, they said. The teacher closed the door. Within seconds, the fire alarm went off. ""We instinctively walked outside,"" says David. ""We thought it was a drill."" As David's class walked towards the evacuation zone, they saw a ""tsunami"" of people running towards them. They turned and followed the crowd down the corridor. What they didn't realise was this: they were heading towards the shooter. At least 17 dead in US school shooting ""A very heroic janitor stopped us,"" says David. ""He said, 'Don't go that way - he [the shooter] is over there'."" After they turned round, Ashley Kurth - the teacher in charge of the culinary programme, known in school as Chef Kurth - funnelled the crowd into her own classroom. ""Within 30 seconds she easily had 30 or 40 people in there,"" says David. The lights were switched off. One girl had a panic attack, and was given water. But, says David, most people were ""relatively calm"". Then news of the shooting filtered through on their phones. David's younger sister is also a student at Stoneman Douglas. ""I knew she was alive - at least in the beginning,"" he says. ""I had a text from her, and a call. She was very frantic. I was petrified but I knew she was on the other side of the school [away from the shooter]."" David called his dad, a former FBI agent, who told him to stay calm. Other pupils called their parents, saying they loved them. But, says David, there wasn't much crying. ""There was a group energy that kept us strong. There was a melancholy calm."" Students and adults leave the school in the aftermath of the shooting David is a student journalist, so started interviewing people, using his phone to record them. ""I figured, if I died, at least this [the recording] would be passed on to other people, so these voices would echo on."" David tried to stay calm and help others. The classroom had two doors: if the shooter entered one, he thought, they could escape through another. But he knew that might not be enough. ""I realised I may not survive,"" he says. ""It was going through everybody's minds at some point."" What we know about the suspect As it happened: Florida shooter targets school After around an hour, five members of a police Swat team burst into the classroom. They told people to get down, and put their hands up. When they were allowed to stand up, they walked out of the classroom, then started running. Their hands were still in the air. ""At this time, they hadn't eradicated the suspect,"" says David. ""We didn't know that, but they didn't have him. We were quite frankly running for our lives."" When he reached safety, David says he felt ""shock - pure shellshock"". He found his dad, and his sister. One of her friends was killed. Police vehicles block the road to the high school In the early hours of Thursday, David was still outside the school where 17 people died hours earlier. ""I feel a mix of anger, sadness, but mostly passion,"" he says. ""I don't want this to ever happen to anyone else again. The fact is there are 17 families that now have empty roomsâ¦ ""These are people's kids. They've poured all the love, everything they could ever get, into these kids. And it's all been taken by one piece of metal, and bled out onto the floor.""

One million call for Snapchat roll-back,"One million people have signed a petition calling on Snapchat to roll back its latest redesign. The changes were intended to separate interactions with friends from branded content - including that of celebrities and influencers. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegelwrote in a blog post,externalthat he believed blurring the two had contributed to the rise of fake news. However, thousands of Snapchat userssay that the new layout is hard to use,external. Nic Rumsey, who set up the petition, wrote that some are using Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps - which use servers abroad to mask the location of a device - in order to access the older version of the platform: ""That's how annoying this update has become,"" he said. ""Many 'new features' are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years."" The petition, posted on the change.org website, is one of several appealing to Snapchat to revert to its previous state. Users now swipe left to see and interact with their friends, and swipe right to see branded and celebrity content. Model Chrissie Teigen tweeted that she didn't like feeling that her followers no longer felt like ""friends"" as a result. ""How many people have to hate an update for it to be reconsidered?"" she asked. Some users have followed a six-step procedure, which involves turning off automatic updates and reinstalling the app in order to get the ""old"" style Snapchat back.

"Rich and poor life expectancy gap widensBoys born in the richest areas are likely to outlive those born in the poorest by 8.4 years, a study says.5h5 hours agoHealth","The life expectancy gap between England's richest and poorest neighbourhoods has widened since 2001, a report says. On average, a boy born in one of the most affluent areas will outlive one born in one of the poorest by 8.4 years. That was up from 7.2 years in 2001, the Longevity Science Panel (LSP) found. The government said it was tackling the issue, and added cancer survival rates were ""at an all-time high"". The LSP report said the results were concerning and required further investigation to understand the causes. But its authors said income inequality was the biggest factor. Rich and poor lifespan gap 'widening' Life expectancy rises 'grinding to halt' The LSP looked at data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2015. This divides England into 33,000 residential areas which are rated on a range of factors, such as income levels, health, education and crime. It found that death rates for 60 to 89-year-olds had improved for all socio-economic groups between 2001 and 2015, but the biggest gains were recorded among the most well-off. The result is that men and women in that age group, who were from the least advantaged fifth of the country, are now about 80% more likely than those from the most advantaged fifth to die in any given year, it said. In 2001 the higher chance of older people dying if they lived in a poor area, compared to a wealthy one, was lower at just 52% for men and 41% for women. Dame Karen Dunnell, chair of the LSP, said: ""Dying earlier if you are poor is the most unfair outcome of all, so we should all be concerned about the growing divergence in rich-poor life expectancy. ""To reduce the risk of further widening, we need better understanding of the precise causes, followed by co-ordinated policy initiatives across health, work, welfare, pension and housing to improve outcomes for all,"" she added. The study also found: Girls born in the top fifth of areas on average live 5.8 years longer than those born in the bottom 20% - up from a five-year gap in 2001 For a 60-year-old man the difference is five years - up from 4.1 in 2001 For women of the same age it is 4.2 years - up from 3.1 The report also found there had been a slowing down in the long-standing trend for improvement in mortality rates, for all groups since 2011, which it said could be linked to cuts to public spending in the NHS and social care sector. Differences in income, smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption, as well as different rates of uptake of preventive health services and treatment rates for diseases, could explain the difference in life expectancy across socio-economic groups, it said. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Health inequality is a challenging and complex area, but we are committed to tackling this issue. ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high and smoking rates are at an all-time low, but we know there is still too much variation."" They added Â£16bn is being invested in local government public health services. The LSP was set up by the insurance provider Legal and General to look at how various factors affect life expectancy.

One million call for Snapchat roll-backSnapchat's changes have sparked a backlash as users complain that it is more difficult to use.2h2 hours agoTechnology,"One million people have signed a petition calling on Snapchat to roll back its latest redesign. The changes were intended to separate interactions with friends from branded content - including that of celebrities and influencers. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegelwrote in a blog post,externalthat he believed blurring the two had contributed to the rise of fake news. However, thousands of Snapchat userssay that the new layout is hard to use,external. Nic Rumsey, who set up the petition, wrote that some are using Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps - which use servers abroad to mask the location of a device - in order to access the older version of the platform: ""That's how annoying this update has become,"" he said. ""Many 'new features' are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years."" The petition, posted on the change.org website, is one of several appealing to Snapchat to revert to its previous state. Users now swipe left to see and interact with their friends, and swipe right to see branded and celebrity content. Model Chrissie Teigen tweeted that she didn't like feeling that her followers no longer felt like ""friends"" as a result. ""How many people have to hate an update for it to be reconsidered?"" she asked. Some users have followed a six-step procedure, which involves turning off automatic updates and reinstalling the app in order to get the ""old"" style Snapchat back.

Driving bans for children as young as 12,"This video can not be played 'Mikey' illegally started driving when he was 16 years old More than 1,000 driving bans were issued in 2017 to children not legally old enough to be behind the wheel. The number of disqualifications for children aged 16 and under rose to 1,024 last year, compared with 696 in 2014, according to DVLA figures. Children as young as 12 were among those banned, with 33 disqualifications issued in total during 2017 for those aged 13 and under. Motoring group the RAC described the figures as ""the tip of the iceberg"". The statistics were given to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. Clockwise from top left: Anthony Armour, Darnell Harte, Robbie Meerun, Elliot and Ellis Thornton-Kimmit were all killed in a crash in Meanwood, Leeds A 15-year-old boy caused the deaths of five people in Leedsin November when he crashed a stolen car into a tree after reaching speeds of 88mph. The teenager, who cannot be named due to his age, admitted five counts of causing death by dangerous driving and was detained for four and a half years. Elise Dhers, whose 15-year-old brother Darnell Harte was killed in the crash, is calling for tougher tariffs for perpetrators. She said: ""The judge should have said 'I'm going to set an example, I'm going to teach young boys or girls who feel it's OK to steal a car that there are consequences for their actions'."" Currently, UK courts can impose driving bans on those who are legally too young to drive.  Once they have turned 17 and their disqualification period ends, they will be able to drive again. Penalty points would still be listed on any licence issued and could lead to an increased ban if another offence is committed. One teenager from Bradford, who wanted to be known as Mikey, described how at aged 16 he and his friends would ""chip in"" up to Â£500 to pay an adult to obtain them a car. ""I've been in a police chase but we got away because we went into these streets and the [patrol] car couldn't get into these little streets. The police had to go over the kerbs slowly and that's when we got away,"" the 18-year-old said. ""The highest speed I did was 135mph, I was putting people in danger. If I hit someone, that's someone else's family that I'm destroying - it's not worth it."" ""Mikey"" said he had been involved in a police chase while driving under age RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""It presents such a danger to every other road user, because they're not only driving without a licence, they don't have insurance. ""No doubt this is the tip of the iceberg because they have to be caught breaking the law and inevitably many will be getting away scot-free."" He added the number of roads policing officers had been cut by about 27% since 2010, so ""the chances of getting caught are far lower"". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said they were committed to courts having sufficient powers to deal with driving offences. It added: ""We will bring forward proposals for changes in the law as soon as parliamentary time allows. ""These proposals will take account of, and incorporate, all of government's proposals for safer roads, including the Department of Transport's review of cycle safety.""

One in six children 'affected by war',"A Syrian Civil Defence member carries a baby from the scene of an air strike in the Eastern Ghouta on 7 February One in every six children are now living in a global conflict zone, a new report by Save the Children claims. Children are at more risk from armed conflict now than at any other time in the last 20 years, the charity says. Its new analysis found more than 357 million children were living in a conflict zone - an increase of 75% from the 200 million of 1995. Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia were ranked as the most dangerous places for children. In general, children in the Middle East were most likely to live in a conflict zone, where two in every five lived within 50km of the site of a battle or other fatal attack. Africa was ranked second, at one in five. Just under half of at-risk children - some 165 million - were classified as living in ""high-intensity"" conflict zones. Those children are at risk of all six of what the United Nations calls ""grave violations"": killing and maiming recruitment and use of children sexual violence abduction attacks on schools and hospitals denial of humanitarian access Save the Children used UN and other research data in its report, but criticised ""huge gaps"" in the scope of data recorded by forces at war with one another. Despite its concerns, it said there was still a 300% increase in the number of children killed and maimed since 2010, according to a record of incidents verified by the UN. Part of the reason for the increase in the number of children living in dangerous areas is due to an ""increasing trend"" of urban warfare in towns and cities, it said, plus a recent trend of long and complicated armed conflicts. Deliberate humanitarian blockades by extremist groups and long-term sieges in countries such as Yemen and Syria are also to blame. ""Siege tactics and starvation tactics are also increasingly being used as a weapon of war against civilians, to try to force an armed group or whole community to surrender,"" the report says. Attacks on hospitals and schools, it said, have become the ""new normal"". This video can not be played Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim Save the Children says that despite improved international legal standards to protect children, ""increasingly brutal tactics are being utilised"" by actors around the world. That includes the use of recruitment child soldiers, and sexual violence against children - which it says is largely unknown because of a reluctance to report sexual abuse. And while the use of some weapons known to have killed and maimed children - such as chemical weapons, landmines and cluster bombs - has reduced, other threats remain. It cited the use of child suicide bombers and the widespread continued use of weapons like barrel bombs and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which kill soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. In addition to the risk of injury or death, children in affected regions often lack basic sanitation, education, and suffer from malnutrition. Last year the group said high levels of Syrian children were suffering from ""toxic stress"" due to their prolonged exposure to the horrors of war. ""Children are suffering things that no child ever should; from sexual violence to being used as suicide bombers,"" CEO Helle Thorning Schmidt said. ""Their homes, schools and playgrounds have become battlefields."" ""Crimes like this against children are the darkest kind of abuse imaginable, and are a flagrant violation of international law,"" she added, calling on world leaders to do more. The report, titled The War on Children, is based on research carried out by Save the Children and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), looking at trends in international violence from 1995-2016. Data from 2017 is incomplete, so recent escalations such in places such as Myanmar are not fully reflected. The report was released ahead of the influential Munich Security Conference, which begins on Friday and which the charity says is an opportunity for global leaders to agree on measures to protect children.

Beija Flor beat 12 other schools to win the top prize at the carnival for a 14th time. Preparations for the parade begin months in advance. Entrants in the competition often adopt a political theme. The second-placed school also criticised Brazilian leaders in their entry, depicting President Michel Temer as a vampire.

Hillwalkers warned about magnets in clothing,"Compasses can give misleading readings once exposed to magnets Magnets in outdoor clothing and on phone covers raise the risk of hillwalkers making navigational errors, Mountaineering Scotland has warned. The group said magnets were increasingly being used as fastenings on items such as gloves. Mountaineering Scotland said a recent incident in Glen Shee was thought to have been caused by a magnetic fastening deflecting a compass needle. It said a group of walkers had wrongly headed east instead of west. They then became disorientated in low cloud and ended up miles away from a road that would have led them to safety. Heather Morning, mountain safety adviser for Mountaineering Scotland, said: ""Fortunately no-one was hurt - just pride dented - but it could have turned out so much worse had mountain conditions been more severe. ""The reason for the error was the compass. ""It had been stored in a pocket next to a mobile phone in a case which had a magnetic closure on it, and the magnet had reversed the polarity of the compass needle, so that the north arrow pointed south."" The phenomenon of reversed polarity has been publicised previously in mountaineering circles. People are advised to keep their compasses well away from mobile phones. Mountaineering Scotland said it was concerned by the growing use of magnetic closures in outdoor clothing. Ms Morning said: ""Modern technology is great. The resources available now to keep us warm and safe in the mountains have never been better. ""But more joined-up thinking is needed between outdoor clothing manufacturers and mountain users to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences.""

UK: Russia behind 'malicious' cyber attack,"The Russian military was directly behind a ""malicious"" cyber-attack on Ukraine that spread globally last year, the US and Britain have said. The White House said June's NotPetya ransomware attack caused billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was ""ripping up the rule book"" and the UK would respond. Moscow denies being behind the attack, calling such claims ""Russophobic"". Ransomware, which threatens to delete the target's files unless they pay a ransom, is regarded as the fastest growing form of computer virus. Defence secretary warns of Russian plot UK security chief blames Russia for hacks Facebook in new Russian Brexit vote probe May accuses Putin of election meddling Experts believe about 2,000 NotPetya attacks were launched, mainly aimed at Ukraine. The country Ukraine has been locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. In the NotPetya attack, businesses with strong trade links with Ukraine, such as the UK's Reckitt Benckiser, Dutch delivery firm TNT and Danish shipping giant Maersk were affected. The attack is estimated to have cost companies more than $1.2bn (Â£850m). This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Reckitt Benckiser - maker of Dettol, Durex and Strepsils - said the attack disrupted its manufacturing output and shipping capacity for up to two months. On Thursday the UK government took the unusual step of publicly accusing the Russia military of being behind the attack. ""The UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" the foreign office said in a statement. Later, the White House also pointed the finger at Russia. ""In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,"" a statement said. ""This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber attack that will be met with international consequences."" Russia, however, said the claims were ""groundless"" and that Russian businesses were among those whose systems were affected. ""It's not more than a continuation of the Russophobic campaign,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Bitcoin gobbling Iceland energy supplies 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Tax haven firms own 23,000 UK properties Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: ""The UK government judges that the Russian government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber attack."" ""Its reckless release disrupted organisations across Europe costing hundreds of millions of pounds. ""We call upon Russia to be the responsible member of the international community it claims to be rather then secretly trying to undermine it."" Mr Williamson warned that the West had ""entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber attacks"".

Apple's HomePod speakers can mark wood,"Pocket-lint published this image of a mark left by its Homepod test unit Apple's new smart speakers can discolour wooden surfaces, leaving a white mark where they are placed, the firm has acknowledged. The US company has suggested that owners may have to re-oil furniture if the HomePod is moved. The device went on sale last week after having been delayed from its original 2017 release date. Apple updated its help page,externalto suggest ""placing your HomePod on a different surface"" if customers were concerned. ""It is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces,"" the company said. ""The marks can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the table surface, and will often go away after several days when the speaker is removed from the wooden surface.

""It wasn't the end of the world for us. But if you've bought an expensive Scandinavian sideboard or some beautiful piece of wooden furniture and then got a mark on it from the speaker, you can imagine the horror,"" he added.

The NYT's Wirecutter site said Apple told it that ""the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface."" Apple added that if the marks did not improve then customers could ""try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer's suggested oiling method"". It is not yet clear if the problem affects all HomePod speakers or just a sample of the initial production run. The Â£319 HomePod has been praised in reviews for the quality of the bass notes that it can produce. But to do so, it needs to be placed on a flat surface. The HomePod costs more than Google, Amazon and Sonos' entry-level smart speakers but reviews suggest it offers superior sound ""Most others devices that I test have small feet that raise them off the counter ever so slightly to cause an air flow,"" commented Mr Miles. ""But the HomePod appears to need contact with the surface that it's on to resonate and create the powerful bass. ""I put it on a coaster to see if that would combat [leaving a mark] but that destroyed the bass qualities, so that's not a fix to the problem,"" he added. According to one furniture polish advice site,the most common causes of white marks,externalon wooden furniture are heat and moisture. The BBC has asked Apple for more details about the issue. One blogger who closely follows the company was surprised by the development. ""Anyone who runs into this should be outraged,""wrote Daring Fireball's John Gruber,external. ""Apple has been making products that go on shelves and tables for years... and I've never seen a report of damage to a surface.

Pension mis-selling scandal 'erupting',"British Steel pension scheme members were targeted by ""vulture"" financial advisers after Tata was allowed to offload its retirement fund, MPs say. In 2017 the Indian firm announced a restructuring of the Â£14bn fund to keep its UK loss-making operations afloat. But the government, Tata and regulators failed to protect 124,000 members from a ""major mis-selling scandal"", the Work and Pensions Select Committee said. The UK government has yet to issue its response to the ""neglect"" claim. The Pensions Regulator said it would continue to work to protect savers. The report from the Work and Pensions Select Committee was looking at the closure of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS). Regulators had accepted that Tata Steel UK would be insolvent if it continued to sponsor the scheme. About 8,000 people are employed by Tata across England and Wales, including 3,500 in Port Talbot, but those figures were dwarfed by number of retired steelworkers - more than 100,000 - who were members of the scheme. Those members had to decide what to do with their pension funds after the scheme was separated from Tata last September. Between October and December 2017, they had a choice of entering into a new Tata-backed scheme, BSPS2, or the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). Both were less generous than the scheme that closed but BSPS2 was better for the majority of people than the PPF. This video can not be played Frank Field MP: ""Pension holders were fleeced by financial vultures"" A third option was transferring out of the scheme completely - a so-called DB transfer - but the committee said this is ""not usually in someone's interests"". But circumstances surrounding the BSPS ""created perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"", the MPs concluded. OneTata worker told the BBChe lost almost Â£200,000 by transferring out of the BSPS after seeking independent financial advice. Last week, the scheme's trustees said that, since March 2017, it has processed 2,600 pension DB transfers with a total value of Â£1.1bn. The average amount transferred out was Â£400,000 and in around 20 cases the transfer value exceeded Â£1 million. This video can not be played Retired Port Talbot steelworker Tony Taylor said a minority of pensioners have been taken advantage of The committee noted that an outline plan to save Tata Steel UK, the ""sponsor"" of the BSPS, had been in place since May 2017. But it said those signatories to the deal - Tata, the UK government and Pensions Regulator - had neglected the pension scheme's members. Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""Once again we find the pensions regulator fiddling while Rome burns, when it should have seen this rip-off coming."" He added: ""All the responsible authorities must act, now, to stop more people being cheated."" Richard Bevan is one of the Tata workers who fears he has been targeted by ""financial vultures"" The financial advisers' regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also faces serious criticism for how it handled concerns over mis-selling. Other criticisms in the report were: Despite a ""surge in interest"" in DB transfers in April 2017, the FCA did not act until November, by which stage BSPS members were faced with a pressing deadline, creating ""perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"" A communication plan by BSPS was ""woefully inadequate"", under-resourced and unable to provide basic facts for members to make a complex choice. The report said it was the responsibility of the Pensions Regulator to ensure members were well-informed, but ""all this failed"" Around 25,000 scheme members did not make any choice, thought to include many very elderly or ill pensioners. These members will move into the PPF scheme. The report said the government had not implemented a system of ""deemed consent"" to ensure that any member who would have been obviously better off in BSPS2 would automatically be moved, and had not explained its decision. The report recommended the government should ensure deemed consent is in place for similar future deals ""Contingent charging"", where financial advisers are only paid for recommending a particular course of action, had led to members receiving poor advice. The government should ban contingent charging for all DB transfer advice. 'Poor' British Steel pensions advice reviewed by police Steel industry fears Brexit deflecting issues Community union considers steel pensions advice action The pensions deal followed a year of crisis in the steel industry in the UK, with threats to jobs and falling prices Responses to the findings: TheFCAsaid it was reviewing the rules that apply to firms advising on pension transfers. ""We believe the committee's recommendations are sensible,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We are currently looking at the register to see how we can make it easier to use."" It said it remained focused on ensuring consumers are protected. ThePensions Regulatorsaid it had fulfilled its primary role by evaluating and approving this complex restructuring of the scheme. ""We believe this was the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what was a very challenging situation, bringing greater certainty for thousands of scheme members,"" said a spokesman. ""We also helped tackle unscrupulous financial advisers who were exploiting the situation and the current high transfer values available by working closely with the scheme trustees, the FCA and The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS)."" Tata Steelsaid the consultation process was a major undertaking involving ""complex financial detail"". A spokesman said it was pleased so many pension scheme members made a positive choice to select the best scheme for their future. ""We were also pleased to note the trustee expects the new scheme to pass the agreed qualifying conditions to go forward,"" he said. TheBSPStrustee welcomed the work being done to ensure that members taking transfers from defined benefit pension schemes ""do so on the basis of suitable advice"". He added that the actions of some financial advisors during the process was ""something that the committee rightly highlights as a concern for all involved"". A spokesman for thesteel unions, including Community, said: ""There is clear evidence from this report that some steelworkers were exploited and given poor advice on hugely important choices. ""Regulators need to toughen up when it comes to shutting down irresponsible financial advisers, and warning people about which firms to avoid."" He said they would continue to support members who believe they have been ripped off ""and will keep lobbying government and regulators to ensure measures are put in place so that such a scandal can never again be allowed to happen.""

Porn star 'free to discuss' Trump story,"The newspaper says Mr Cohen declined to answer why the ""private transaction"" was made An adult film star who has been embroiled in allegations of an affair with President Donald Trump is free to tell her story, her manager has said. Stormy Daniels is no longer bound by a non-disclosure contract after Mr Trump's lawyer admitted he paid her, manager Gina Rodriguez says. Mr Trump's personal lawyer confirmed in a statement to media he privately paid Ms Daniels $130,000 (Â£95,000) in 2016. Ms Rodriguez says that acknowledgement allows her client to speak freely. Porn actress Stormy Daniels alleged in 2011 that she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006 ""Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,"" Ms Rodriguez told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Her statement comes after Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told the New York Times he paid Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,""Mr Cohen told the New York Times,external. He said he told the Federal Election Commission the same after a watchdog group filed a complaint about the payment, claiming that it had served as an ""in-kind"" political contribution to Mr Trump's campaign. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump's lawyer and all-around fixer Michael Cohen has said he doesn't plan ""further comment"" on his six-figure payment to Stormy Daniels. His statements, however, raise more questions than they answer. While he said the money came from his ""personal funds"" and was not reimbursed directly or indirectly by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign, that leaves open the possibility that he was compensated by other parties - including Mr Trump himself. Why, in his generosity, would Mr Cohen give $130,000 to Ms Daniels? The Wall Street Journal has reported that it was in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement about a decade-old affair between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. Circumstantial evidence - that Ms Daniels had been in contact with media outlets prior to the transfer and has since gone silent - lends credence to this line. Even though the alleged affair is long since past, a story about possible hush money and an attempted cover-up just weeks before the presidential election is much more dangerous for a White House already on its heels. And if it turns out there's more to the money trail than has been disclosed, an embarrassing situation could quickly morph into a criminal inquiry. A Stormy (Daniels) situation: A porn star scandal Trump can't shake ""The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,"" Mr Cohen said. The lawyer has previously said Mr Trump ""vehemently denies"" it occurred. The revelations on Wednesday follow US media reports that the porn actress known as Ms Daniels was paid to sign an agreement stopping her discussing an alleged affair. She first said she had a relationship with Mr Trump in a 2011 interview. In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine,the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006,external, shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January whenthe Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election,external, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Ms Clifford was believed to be in discussion with US media about a television appearance to discuss Mr Trump at the time, the report said. Responding to questions from CNN about why the payment was made, Mr Cohen said: ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage."" ""I will always protect Mr Trump,"" Mr Cohen added. On 30 January, Ms Daniels' publicist released a statement in her name denying having an affair with Mr Trump. But many - including Ms Daniels herself - were quick to note that the signature attached to that denial did not bear much resemblance to another copy of her autograph which had been attached to an earlier statement. That denial had been released by Mr Cohen on 10 January. Ms Daniels hosted a Super Bowl party last month She has since made several public appearances on television and at strip clubs, but has remained tight-lipped when asked directly about Mr Trump in interviews. Minutes after Mr Trump's first formal State of the Union address to Congress, she gave an interview to late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel. In it, she refused to directly answer whether she had signed a non-disclosure agreement, or if she had ""ever made love to someone whose name rhymes with Lonald Lump"".

"Austria, the ashtray of Europe?","A total smoking ban was due in May but the new government has scrapped the plans Many Western countries have banned smoking in bars and restaurants, but Austria is bucking that trend. Under a law passed in 2015, Austria was due to bring in a total ban this May, but now its new government of the conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party have scrapped the plans. The move was spearheaded by the leader of the Freedom Party, Austria's Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, himself a smoker, who told parliament last month that it was about freedom of choice. He said restaurants should be free to decide if they want to have smoking sections, where ""a citizen has the possibility to decide perhaps to enjoy a cigarette or a pipe or a cigar with their coffee"". The move has horrified Austria's medical establishment. Dr Manfred Neuberger, professor emeritus at the Medical University of Vienna, says it is ""a public health disaster"". ""The decision is irresponsible. It was a victory for the tobacco industry. The new government made Austria into the ashtray of Europe."" Many of the famous coffee houses in the centre of Vienna have already gone smoke-free Dr Neuberger says Austria already has ""shamefully high"" smoking rates among young people, ""particularly compared to other high income countries"". A survey of 26 countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2013 said Austria had the highest smoking prevalence of children aged 15, a position it held since 1994. Now the Vienna Chamber of Physicians and Austrian Cancer Aid are launching a petition calling on the government to reconsider. Dr Thomas Szekeres, the head of the Austrian and Vienna Chamber of Physicians, says they ""don't understand why the government wants to step back and allow smoking"". Smoking 'causes one in 10 deaths' How has smoking ban changed the UK? 'One smoke leads to daily habit for most' ""We know smoking causes severe heart attacks, cancer and we know that in countries where smoking is not allowed in restaurants and bars, employees are protected and the whole population turned out to be healthier."" Many of the famous cafes in the centre of Vienna have already gone smoke-free, partly in anticipation of the plans for a ban, and partly because of tourism. But others remain smoky. Large restaurants have to provide separate smoking and non-smoking areas - but the rules on keeping doors closed between the two spaces are widely ignored. Small establishments can choose to be smoking or smoke-free. At the Kleines CafÃ©, each marble-topped table has an ashtray and the air is blue with tobacco smoke. Peter Noever, one of the guests there, says Vienna has a habit of turning back the clock. ""The Viennese believe that they are something super-special and smoking is a very strong part of culture. Peter Noever: ""The Viennese believe that smoking... is a very strong part of culture"" ""I was a heavy smoker, but I haven't smoked for 15 years or more. I smoked so much, I can't smoke any more. But I like smokers - they are more human."" Peter Dobcak from the Vienna Chamber of Commerce says he is in favour of overturning the ban, although he admits there are splits among restaurant owners. ""We have a lot of restaurants who prefer to let the guests smoke. ""The higher level restaurant business is in favour of the ban. And the bars, the discos and the clubs are mostly in favour of smoking because the law forces people to smoke outside and then there is noise... late in the night."" CafÃ© Hummel, in Vienna's bourgeois eighth district, went smoke-free one year ago. Its owner, Christina Hummel, says her business went down by about 5% after she banned cigarettes. But she says she is focusing on new, younger customers. ""We see, on the positive side, that more families are coming to visit us for breakfast with their children. We have the big challenge to change our business concept."" Cafe owner Christina Hummel says she is now focusing on new customers after banning cigarettes Opinions among her guests were mixed. Gerhard Lammerer, a non-smoking regular, said he was against the ban. ""People will always smoke. Why don't we leave things the way they are? Why should we make things stricter and forbid it? In the past people smoked the strongest cigarettes until they were 90."" But others strongly disagree. ""I think the smoking ban is the right thing,"" Christoph Riemekasten said. ""The air is better. In other countries there's no problem with a smoking ban, just in Austria."" Leo Lukas, a cabaret artist: ""I'm absolutely pro-ban. The life quality is much better"" Leo Lukas, a cabaret artist, agreed. He says he can breathe. ""I was a smoker myself for over 30 years, and still there are some nights when I am smoking. ""But I'm absolutely pro-ban, because the life quality is much better - even in a traditional coffee house like this. I love it. It is really better.""

"Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer'French researchers studied effects of highly-processed foods, such as cakes, bread and chicken nuggets.3m4 minutes agoHealth","This video can not be played What you need to know about bread A link between highly processed foods and cancer has been suggested by French researchers. They classified foods including cakes, chicken nuggets and mass-produced bread as ""ultra-processed"". A study of 105,000 people hinted the more of such foods people ate, the greater their risk of cancer. A lot of caution is being expressed about the study, but experts said a healthy diet is best. Mass-produced packaged breads and buns Sweet or savoury packaged snacks including crisps Chocolate bars and sweets Sodas and sweetened drinks Meatballs, poultry and fish nuggets Instant noodles and soups Frozen or shelf-life ready meals Foods made mostly or entirely from sugar, oils and fats Diet is already known to affect the risk of cancer. Being overweight is thebiggest preventable cause of the disease after smoking,externaland the World Health Organization saysprocessed meat does slightly increase the risk of cancer. But what about ultra-processed foods? The team - at Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite - used food surveys on two days to work out what people were eating. Those on the study, who were mostly middle-aged women, were followed for an average of five years. The results,in the British Medical Journal,external, showed that if the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet increased by 10%, then the number of cancers detected increased by 12%. During the study: On average, 18% of people's diet was ultra-processed On average, there were 79 cancers per 10,000 people each year Upping the proportion of processed food by 10% would lead to nine extra cancers per 10,000 people per year The researchers concluded: ""These results suggest that the rapidly increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods may drive an increasing burden of cancer in the next decades."" But they said the findings need to ""be confirmed by other large-scale"" studies and research was needed to establish what could be behind the link. This study is far from the definitive take on ultra-processed foods and cancer. It cannot say ultra-processed foods are a cause of cancer. There are also factors that muddy the waters as people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had other behaviours that have been linked to cancer.

While the researchers did adjust their analysis for this they say their impact ""cannot be entirely excluded"". Prof Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said: ""It's already known that eating a lot of these foods can lead to weight gain, and being overweight or obese can also increase your risk of cancer, so it's hard to disentangle the effects of diet and weight."" 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water New antibiotic family discovered in dirt Gang 'stole spinal fluid from women' Overall she said the study was a ""warning signal to us to have a healthy diet"" but people should not worry about eating a bit of processed food ""here and there"" as long as they were getting plenty of fruit, vegetables and fibre. Dr Ian Johnson, from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, said the study had ""identified some rather weak associations"". Does the type of bread you eat make a difference to your cancer risk? But he criticised the vagueness of the term ultra-processed. He said: ""The problem is that the definition of ultra-processed foods they have used is so broad and poorly defined that it is impossible to decide exactly what, if any, causal connections have been observed."" For Prof Tom Sanders at King's College London, the definition of ultra-processed foods throws up too many quirks. He said mass-produced bread would be classed as ultra-processed, but a home-made loaf or bread from a posh local bakery would not. ""This classification seems arbitrary and based on the premise that food produced industrially has a different nutritional and chemical composition from that produced in the home or by artisans. This is not the case,"" Prof Sanders said. Even the accompanying commentary in the British Medical Journal warned against jumping to conclusions. Martin Lajous and Adriana Monge from the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico, warned ""we are a long way from understanding the full implications of food processing for health and well-being"". They said the study was simply ""an initial insight"". What you need to know about bread.

"Catholic charity sacks former Oxfam workerCafod said it was unaware of abuse allegations, while Oxfam loses another celebrity ambassador.","The sacked worker had been among the Oxfam staff in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake A Catholic charity has sacked a worker after it emerged he had been accused of sexually exploiting vulnerable people in Haiti while working for Oxfam. Cafod said it was ""unaware"" of the claims until contacted this week by the Times, which broke the Oxfam story. Meanwhile, Sengalese singer Baaba Maal has told BBC Newsnight he is standing down from his role as a global ambassador to Oxfam after six years. The star said he found the sex abuse claims ""disgusting and heartbreaking"". Describing the allegations as ""very sad"", Maal said he was ""disassociating"" himself from Oxfam ""immediately"". Maal was one of 14 global ambassadors for Oxfam International. Others include singer Annie Lennox, the band Coldplay, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the model Helena Christensen. However, Glastonbury festival founder Michael Eavis defended Oxfam, calling it a ""wonderful"" charity. Speaking at the NME Awards, he said the festival had raised Â£6m for the charity, and planned to continue its support. Mr Eavis added that ""a few dodgy people"" should not discredit its good work. Earlier, actressMinnie Driver stood down from her ambassador rolewith Oxfam, saying she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Baaba Maal has been an Oxfam global ambassador since 2012 Pressure on Oxfam has been growing after allegations first arose last week about its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in Haiti. The charity, which denies covering up the behaviour of its staff following an earthquake in the country in 2010, is being investigated by the Charity Commission. The charities regulator said it would announce the scope of its statutory inquiry,externalinto Oxfam on Thursday. Oxfam said it would co-operate with the inquiry and recognised it was in the public interest to be ""transparent and accountable"" and that lessons are learned. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? It comes as Cafod, an international development charity, said it has sacked an employee implicated in claims sexually exploitation in Haiti. The charity said the man had applied for the job in 2014. References were provided from his previous employers and from somebody the worker said was a former line manager from Oxfam, Cafod added. This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker He was dismissed on Wednesday when Oxfam confirmed claims he was among its ex-workers who had been accused of sexual misconduct. Cafod said it was ""committed to a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct"" and the employee's failure to disclose the circumstances of his departure from Oxfam were in breach of its code of behaviour. The charity has also reviewed two historical cases of sexual misconduct allegations against other employees. One yielded no evidence and one saw a staff member dismissed. In other developments: International aid group Doctors Without Borders said it handled 24 cases of harassment or sexual abuse last year More than 1,000 people cancelled their regular donations to Oxfamover the weekend Organisations including Marks & Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award say they are considering their association with the charity International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the Oxfam case. Oxfam said it sacked its country director in Haiti, Damien Berrendorf, last year, following allegations of ""mismanagement"" and ""inappropriate behaviour"" which were reported through its own whistleblowing line. The charity said the dismissal was not related to sexual misconduct nor the 2011 case. Speaking to the BBC, Oxfam's regional director in Asia for the last two years, Lan Mercado, revealed she is aware ofallegations of sexual abuse against staff in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepalfrom 2009-2013. Lan Mercado took up her post as Oxfam's Asia regional director in 2016 Ms Mercado said the scale of misconduct was ""not comparable"" to that in Haiti and while it had been dealt with internally ""according to specified policies"", it would be wrong to say the incidents were covered up. But she said alerting the authorities and other charities about allegations was a ""practice that we need to start"".
