It's snowing - can I refuse to go to work?,"As heavy snow affects large swathes of the UK, many people are finding it hard to get to work on Thursday. Commuters have been warned of major disruption on the road and rail networks after the ""beast from the east"" brought more snow, with Storm Emma expected to make matters even worse. So if getting to work is impossible, what are your rights? Red weather warning ahead of Storm Emma In most cases you are not automatically entitled to pay if you are unable to get to work because of travel disruption or bad weather. But that doesn't necessarily mean you will lose out. If your employer normally provides your travel to work and this has been cancelled because of the bad weather you should still be paid,according to the employment advice and conciliation service Acas.,external Some jobs may also have a specific clause written into their contracts, or have a collective agreement in place, that an employer will pay you if you cannot get to work due to circumstances beyond your control. Some employers might also make discretionary, informal arrangements. For example, they may let you work from home, or agree that you can make up the missed time at a later date. However, they are not obliged to do this. Your employer can ask you to take a day of paid holiday - but only if they give you sufficient warning. The law states that you must be given a warning period of ""at least"" double the length of annual leave you are being asked to take. So, if your employer wants you to take one day's annual leave, for example, they would need to give you two days notice. In these circumstances, you are entitled to be paid. In addition, your employer cannot require you to take the time as annual leave. But don't rush out to make snow angels or have a snowball fight just yet. Your employer can still ask you to work from home, or ask you to go to another workplace that is open if the business has one, according togovernment advice website Gov.uk.,external Employees have the right to take unpaid time off to deal with emergency situations for their children or other dependants. Lawyers suggest that a school being shut at short notice is likely to be considered an emergency. Strictly, the day would be unpaid but not all employers would take this approach. Acas advises,externalyou talk to your employer as soon as you can to explain that you need to take time off and the likely length of the absence. It says one option is that you jointly agree to take the day as annual leave so you do not miss out on pay. Not necessarily. The Health and Safety Executive recommends,externala minimum temperature of 16C for offices where the work is deskbound and fairly sedentary. If the work requires physical effort, the minimum recommended temperature is 13C. These temperatures are not a legal requirement but your employer has a duty to provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But as anyone who's had a row over the office thermostat knows, what feels reasonable to one person may require another to wear their coat in the office. If low temperatures make it unsafe for workers, then Acas says you should be allowed to wear warmer clothing, take extra breaks to make hot drinks and also be allowed to bring in extra heating options such as portable heaters. However, if you are vulnerable in any way, for example are pregnant, then you may be sent home to protect your health, and this would usually be on full pay.

Markle to 'shine light' on women's rights,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle on #MeToo and #TimesUp Meghan Markle wants to ""shine a light on women feeling empowered"" as she begins to work with royal charities. She said she hoped to ""hit the ground running"" as she joined Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to discuss their foundation. Her fiance, Harry, joked that the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The Royal Foundation, set up in 2009, focuses on causes close to the royals' hearts, including the armed forces, conservation and mental health. William, Catherine, Harry and Ms Markle held the foundation's first forum on Wednesday to discuss its plans for the future. ""We've all got that same passion to want to make a difference,"" said Ms Markle. The former actress, who is to marry Prince Harry in May, has previously campaigned for the United Nations on topics such as gender equality and modern slavery. She told the forum: ""For me it's very important to want to hit the ground running... even if it's doing it quietly behind the scenes, which is what I've focused my energy on thus far."" Meghan Markle joined Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on stage in London Prince Harry explained he was keen to focus on sustainable tourism over the coming year She went on: ""[I have also been] meeting with the organisations behind the scenes quietly, learning as much as I can so I can maximise the opportunity we have here to really make an impact."" Speaking about her work on women's rights, she said: ""You'll often hear people say: 'You are helping people find their voices'. ""I fundamentally disagree with that because women don't need to find a voice - they have a voice. ""They need to feel empowered to use it and people need to be encouraged to listen."" Ms Markle said she wanted to ""hit the ground running"" after her wedding in May Analysis By Sarah Campbell, Royal Correspondent, BBC News Billed as the inaugural forum of the Royal Foundation - the focus (from the media's perspective anyway) was largely on Meghan Markle. And, as befits an actress, it's fair to say she stole the show. As has become the norm, early tweets focused on what she was wearing (Jason Wu... if you're interested), her manner (totally at ease) and finally, what she said. Prior to her engagement, Ms Markle had been a prominent advocate of female empowerment, not least through her role with UN Women. It is therefore hardly surprising that she was happy to talk about it as an issue. More interestingly, and unprompted, she mentioned the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns. She didn't endorse the movements, but even their mention could be seen as a break from usual royal protocol, which generally gives a wide berth to any issue which could be seen as political. Is this a glimpse of a slightly more edgy royal-to-be? What is without doubt is that Ms Markle, under the umbrella of the Royal Foundation, will certainly add to the royal's already considerable campaigning power. The Duchess of Cambridge also gave a short speech at the event The foursome laughed when asked whether they had ever had disagreements when working together. William said ""oh yes"", as Harry added: ""Healthy disagreements."" He continued: ""I think it's really good we've got four different personalities, we've all got that same passion to want to make a difference, but different opinions. ""And I think those opinions work really, really well. Working as family does have its challenges, of course it does... the fact everyone is laughing means you know exactly (what I mean) - but we're stuck together for the rest of our lives."" Prince Harry was also heard mentioning how the family were already busy with the ""wedding"", to which Ms Markle replied: ""We can multi-task."" The Duke of Cambridge gave a speech explaining the foundation's core aims Opening the event, Prince William said the foundation's purpose was not to seek ""quick wins"". He said: ""All of the projects have seen us working to change mindsets to make a real and lasting difference. ""They have all seen us trying to tackle the biggest challenges of the day. ""They have all seen the foundation listening and taking advice from charities and experts, rather than showing up and pretending we have all the answers. ""And they have all seen us uniting people, forming teams and coalitions, to work to make a difference together."" Prince Harry added that he was hoping to focus on sustainable tourism in the future while the Duchess, who is heavily pregnant, spoke about parenthood influencing her charitable work.

Major US retailer pulls assault-style rifles,"This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Two major US retailers have announced new restrictions on gun sales following the shooting at a Florida school where 17 people died. Dick's Sporting Goods, which has more than 600 shops, said it would no longer sell assault-style rifles, and backed ""common sense gun reform"". Walmart later said it was raising the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years. It came as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School pupils returned to classes. Grief counsellors were on hand as students and teachers arrived at the campus, two weeks after 17 of their peers were shot dead by an expelled former student with an AR-15 rifle. In the aftermath of the 14 February shooting, pressure has mounted on US politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms includingHertz car rental, United airlines and Delta airlines have ended discounts to NRA members. Trump: Lawmakers 'afraid' of US gun lobby Florida school officer defends his actions âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage Walmart, the largest seller of guns in the US, said it would remove items from its website that resembled assault-style rifles. The retailerstopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015,external, citing low demand. In a statement, Walmart said: ""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms."" In Washington, President Donald Trump urged a group of lawmakers with diverse views to come up with a comprehensive bipartisan solution in a televised meeting. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Mr Trump said he ""would give pretty serious thought to it"", despite opposition from the NRA, which supported him as a candidate. He told the lawmakers: ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA, you can't be petrified."" Also on Wednesday,a teacher in the state of Georgia was arrested after barricading himself in a classroom and firing a handgun.No-one was injured. Guns on display at a Dick's store in Massachusetts In announcing its policy change, Dick's Sporting Goods said in a statement,externalthat it had ""tremendous respect and admiration for the students organising and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country"". It added: ""We have heard you. The nation has heard you."" The retailer said it was committing itself to: No longer selling assault-style rifles (The company had stopped selling such weapons at its main shops after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting but 35 shops run by a subsidiary called Field & Stream had continued to do so) Banning the sale of high-capacity magazines that allow more shots to be fired without reloading Not selling any firearms to anyone under the age of 21 It said that while it supported the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms, ""gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people"". Dick's CEO Edward Stack told CNN he expected a backlash from some customers, saying ""the hunt business is an important part of the business, no doubt about it"". The Parkland shooting suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, bought a gun at Dick's but not the weapon he is alleged to have used in the attack, Mr Stack said. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' School to close over church rifle event Demi Lovato brings Florida survivors on stage ""We did everything by the book, and we did everything that the law required, and he was still able to buy a gun,"" he told ABC. At Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a line of police officers, school staff and community members bearing flowers greeted some 3,000 students who returned to classes on Wednesday morning. There were also many reporters, shouting questions to the teenagers about how they felt. Lyliah Skinner, a 16-year-old student, told the BBC before she left home: ""We're not going to really be learning much today - it's all about healing."" She also said she was feeling nervous ""because I'm scared it's gonna happen again"". Lyliah listed people she knew who would not be returning, including Joaquin Oliver, who sat just in front of her in a class they shared. Lyliah Skinner packs her bag before returning to school David Hogg, a senior student and now leading activist, was also feeling trepidation. It was ""really hard to think about"" what occurred two weeks ago, he said. ""Imagine getting in a plane crash and having to get back on the same plane again and again and again and being expected to learn and act like nothing's wrong,"" he told NBC News. Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control The handling of the shooting by authorities sparked criticism after it emerged that the FBI and local police had failed to follow up on multiple tips about Mr Cruz, and that an armed deputy at the school had stayed outside the school building while the attack took place. The school's Building 12, the site of the shootings, will remain closed and cordoned off indefinitely. Students returned for half a day of classes, but the focus was reconnecting with each other Members of Florida's State House and Senate will soon begin reviewing proposed bills related to firearms, which need their approval and also that of Governor Rick Scott. Among other restrictions, they would raise the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and giving police more control to seize weapons from mentally ill people. A controversial $67m voluntary programme to arm school staff, including teachers, would ensure they were trained by law enforcement and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, according to the New York Times.

UK's transition offer to EU nationals,"EU nationals who arrive in the UK during the transition period after Brexit will be eligible for indefinite leave to remain, the government says. Sources say it is a compromise offer to the EU which wants citizens to have exactly the same rights as they do now during the transition period. It means free movement of people is effectively set to continue until the end of the two year or so transition. But the UK says new arrivals should not expect all the same rights as now. The EU wants the transition period - which is intended to smooth the way to the future post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK says it should last around two years from March 2019. May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft May to fight post-Brexit residency move Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major Brexit: All you need to know Those arriving in the UK after 29 March 2019, the day Britain leaves the EU, will have to register with the authorities if they want to stay longer than three months. They will then be allowed to stay for five years ""working, studying or being self-sufficient"" to qualify to apply for indefinite leave to remain, part of the process of becoming a UK citizen. EU citizens who have been continually living in the EU for five years by 29 March 2019 will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting ""settled status"". They will be able to bring spouses and other family members to the UK automatically under EU free movement rules. Those who arrive after Brexit day will also be able to bring family members to the UK under free movement rules, during the transition period. But - in the main change to the current arrangements - when the transition period has ended they will have to abide by the rules that currently apply to British citizens who want to be joined by family members from outside the EU, such as the minimum income requirement. Since July 2012, UK citizens and settled residents applying to bring a non-EU partner to the country must be earning at least Â£18,600 per year before tax. The threshold is higher for those who are also sponsoring children. Asked how the Home Office proposals differed from free movement - something Theresa May has always insisted will end in March next year - the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We'll have a registration system and some of their rights will be different. ""When we leave EU the free movement directive doesn't apply but during the implementation period people will be free to come and live, work and study here. It's for Brussels to respond, this is us setting out our position."" The Home Office is encouraging EU member states to ""mirror"" these rules for UK citizens moving to EU member states during transition. But in a major sticking point with the EU, the UK is insisting EU citizens arriving in the UK during transition must have their rights defined and interpreted solely in UK law and through the UK courts. British judges will not be able to refer questions of interpretation to the European Court of Justice, the Home Office says. Irish citizens will not be subject to the agreement and therefore will not need to register,the Home Office says in fact sheet explaining the changes,external. When the transition period has ended, the UK will put in place a new immigration system which the Home Office says will ""strengthen control of our borders and address the public's concerns about the impacts of unrestricted immigration from the EU on jobs, wages and public services"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ""We have been pressing the Home Office for some time to clarify the arrangements for EU citizens arriving during the transition period so it is sensible that they have finally done so. ""But they should be a bit more straight with people. This new paper reiterates the prime minister's line that the expectations of EU citizens arriving in the UK after our exit will not be the same as those who moved here before our withdrawal, yet it then goes on to provide a long list of ways in which arrangements will be exactly the same. ""The clock is ticking and there isn't time to negotiate or implement an entirely new system of immigration or citizens' rights by March 2019 and they shouldn't suggest that things will change next year when they won't.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsLong-time Trump aide Hope Hicks to resignHope Hicks, White House communications director and one of President Trump's longest serving advisers, to step down.4m5 minutes agoUS & Canada","Hope Hicks, one of President Trump's closest advisers, is to step down as White House communications director. The announcement came a day after she testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee, but White House sources said this was not the reason. Ms Hicks, 29, is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had achieved all she could. She has worked for Mr Trump for years. She is the fourth person to serve as the president's communications chief. On Tuesday, Ms Hicks gave a nine-hour testimony in front of the panel investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Ms Hicks is reported to have admitted to the panel that she had occasionally told what amounted to ""white lies"" for President Trump, but she denied lying about anything relevant to the investigation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders - who described Ms Hicks as ""in a league of her own"" - said it remained unclear when she would leave the administration. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Hicks is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had accomplished all she could in the White House. Her departure will come as a major blow to Mr Trump, who said he would miss having her by his side. A former press secretary, she rose through the ranks to occupy the desk closest to the Oval Office. Ms Hicks kept a low public profile but recently found herself part of a scandal when newspapers exposed that she was in a relationship with White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who had been accused of domestic violence against past partners. Whennews of the allegations against Mr Porterbroke last month, it was Ms Hicks who helped draft an initial White House statement defending him. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted and was unimpressed with her handling of the controversy. From model to Trump's media director White House aide 'admits white lies' Ms Hicks became head of the White House communications team last August, after the abrupt firing of Anthony Scaramucci. In a statement, Mr Trump said: ""Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. ""I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future."" Mr Scaramucci, speaking on Fox News, said: ""She's one of the least malicious people I've ever met in my life. She's dedicated, she's charming, she's thoughtful, at the end of the day she's going to have an unbelievable career."" A former campaign official quoted by Politico magazine saidMs Hicks's departure left the White House without an expert ""Trump translator"",external. ""She knew what the president wanted and could explain it to the communications [team],"" the official said. Ms Hicks, Mr Scaramucci, Sean Spicer and Mike Dubke have all served in the role since January 2017. The latest upheaval comes just after Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had his White House security clearance downgraded. On Tuesday night, the president also fired off a fierce tweet against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Hope Hicks had been there since the beginning; since before the beginning. When the Trump campaign was just a ragtag band of political neophytes, she was the one distributing press releases and answering media requests. Where others had stumbled or been pushed out of Donald Trump's orbit, Hicks quietly persevered - and rode the train all the way to one of the most powerful White House jobs. Now she too is gone. She lasted nearly as long as the preceding three White House communications directors combined, but the position continues to be cursed. Administration sources insist that it was a planned exit, that she was simply waiting for the right time. It's hard, however, to imagine timing worse than this. It comes just a day after her eight hours of testimony before a congressional committee investigating possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, where she reportedly admitted to telling ""white lies"" in defence of the president. Although she may be exiting the White House, it's unlikely she escapes the spotlight so easily. She had a ringside seat to many of the controversies that have swirled around the Trump campaign and presidency - and subsequent revelations could put her name in the headlines again. Ms Hicks is seen as a key witness in the ongoing inquiry into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia. During the nine-hour hearing on Tuesday, she reportedly stonewalled lawmakers about a 2016 meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee investigating alleged Russian meddling, said that she now needed to testify. ""She has no right to claim executive privilege. She has no claim to refuse to come before the judiciary committee now she's stepped down. She should be a witness before the judiciary committee,"" he said.

"Major US retailer pulls assault-style riflesDick's Sporting Goods bans the kind of gun used to kill Florida students, as their school reopens.2m2 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Two major US retailers have announced new restrictions on gun sales following the shooting at a Florida school where 17 people died. Dick's Sporting Goods, which has more than 600 shops, said it would no longer sell assault-style rifles, and backed ""common sense gun reform"". Walmart later said it was raising the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years. It came as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School pupils returned to classes. Grief counsellors were on hand as students and teachers arrived at the campus, two weeks after 17 of their peers were shot dead by an expelled former student with an AR-15 rifle. In the aftermath of the 14 February shooting, pressure has mounted on US politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms includingHertz car rental, United airlines and Delta airlines have ended discounts to NRA members. Trump: Lawmakers 'afraid' of US gun lobby Florida school officer defends his actions âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage Walmart, the largest seller of guns in the US, said it would remove items from its website that resembled assault-style rifles. The retailerstopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015,external, citing low demand. In a statement, Walmart said: ""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms."" In Washington, President Donald Trump urged a group of lawmakers with diverse views to come up with a comprehensive bipartisan solution in a televised meeting. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Mr Trump said he ""would give pretty serious thought to it"", despite opposition from the NRA, which supported him as a candidate. He told the lawmakers: ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA, you can't be petrified."" Also on Wednesday,a teacher in the state of Georgia was arrested after barricading himself in a classroom and firing a handgun.No-one was injured. Guns on display at a Dick's store in Massachusetts In announcing its policy change, Dick's Sporting Goods said in a statement,externalthat it had ""tremendous respect and admiration for the students organising and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country"". It added: ""We have heard you. The nation has heard you."" The retailer said it was committing itself to: No longer selling assault-style rifles (The company had stopped selling such weapons at its main shops after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting but 35 shops run by a subsidiary called Field & Stream had continued to do so) Banning the sale of high-capacity magazines that allow more shots to be fired without reloading Not selling any firearms to anyone under the age of 21 It said that while it supported the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms, ""gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people"". Dick's CEO Edward Stack told CNN he expected a backlash from some customers, saying ""the hunt business is an important part of the business, no doubt about it"". The Parkland shooting suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, bought a gun at Dick's but not the weapon he is alleged to have used in the attack, Mr Stack said. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' School to close over church rifle event Demi Lovato brings Florida survivors on stage ""We did everything by the book, and we did everything that the law required, and he was still able to buy a gun,"" he told ABC. At Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a line of police officers, school staff and community members bearing flowers greeted some 3,000 students who returned to classes on Wednesday morning. There were also many reporters, shouting questions to the teenagers about how they felt. Lyliah Skinner, a 16-year-old student, told the BBC before she left home: ""We're not going to really be learning much today - it's all about healing."" She also said she was feeling nervous ""because I'm scared it's gonna happen again"". Lyliah listed people she knew who would not be returning, including Joaquin Oliver, who sat just in front of her in a class they shared. Lyliah Skinner packs her bag before returning to school David Hogg, a senior student and now leading activist, was also feeling trepidation. It was ""really hard to think about"" what occurred two weeks ago, he said. ""Imagine getting in a plane crash and having to get back on the same plane again and again and again and being expected to learn and act like nothing's wrong,"" he told NBC News. Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control The handling of the shooting by authorities sparked criticism after it emerged that the FBI and local police had failed to follow up on multiple tips about Mr Cruz, and that an armed deputy at the school had stayed outside the school building while the attack took place. The school's Building 12, the site of the shootings, will remain closed and cordoned off indefinitely. Students returned for half a day of classes, but the focus was reconnecting with each other Members of Florida's State House and Senate will soon begin reviewing proposed bills related to firearms, which need their approval and also that of Governor Rick Scott. Among other restrictions, they would raise the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and giving police more control to seize weapons from mentally ill people. A controversial $67m voluntary programme to arm school staff, including teachers, would ensure they were trained by law enforcement and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, according to the New York Times.

Prezzo set to close 100 restaurants,"Italian restaurant chain Prezzo is preparing to close about a third of its outlets in an attempt to rescue the business, the BBC understands. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. Prezzo is also expected to completely close its TexMex chain Chimichanga, which has 33 restaurants in the UK. The move to close 100 of its 300 stores would form part of a deal to cut rent costs in the future. Specialist restructuring firm AlixPartners is understood to be drafting a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration - on the company's behalf. The CVA aims to make Prezzo viable and allow the company to continue trading. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant The situation means that hundreds of jobs are under threat, but the firm may redeploy some staff. Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a string of High Street firms to run into difficulties. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth collapsed into administration this week. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. Barbecoa, a smaller chain also owned by Jamie Oliver, went into administration earlier this month. Analysts have said fears over the strength of the UK economy have meant consumers have cut back on discretionary spending. Last year, consumer spending fell for the first time since 2012,according to payments processor Visa.,external Wages have also been rising at a slower pace than inflation, leaving consumers worse off. The restaurant sector has also faced higher costs for the ingredients it buys overseas due to the drop in the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union.

Chickengate: KFC now faces gravy shortage,"Some 575 KFC shops closed last week due to a shortage of chicken After a chicken shortage led hundreds of KFC outlets to close last week, the fast food chain has now admitted it is running low on gravy. It said almost all of its 900 shops in the UK and Ireland were now open again. However, ongoing distribution problems meant some restaurants were serving a ""reduced menu"". A spokesman said: ""We're working as hard as we can to get this sorted out. We know that our gravy is a big favourite!""

Almost 700 of KFC's UK outlets were closed last week after it decided to switch suppliers from Bidvest to DHL. At the time, DHL blamed ""operational issues"" at a warehouse near Rugby it was using for deliveries nationwide. The chain has apologised to customers, running a newspaper ad showing a photo of a chicken bucket with the KFC logo letters rearranged to read ""FCK"". The accompanying text read: ""WE'RE SORRY. A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It's not ideal... Thank you for bearing with us."" The GMB union criticised KFC's decision to move its contract from Bidvest, which national officer Mick Rix said was a ""very well respected, specialised logistics provider"", to one that lacked a track record in food distribution.

Waist size 'bigger heart risk in women'Researchers say the waist-to-hip ratio is a better heart attack predictor than general obesity.3h3 hours agoHealth,"Women with bigger waists relative to their hips are at more risk of heart attacks than men of a similar ""apple shape"", research from the George Institute for Global Health says. The study showed waist-to-hip ratio to be a better heart attack predictor than general obesity - 18% stronger than body mass index in women and 6% in men. The report found a high BMI was linked to heart disease risk in both sexes. The researchers interviewed nearly 500,000 UK adults aged 40 to 69. The researchhas been published in the Journal of the American Heart Association,externaland used the UK Biobank resource. Dr Sanne Peters, the report's lead author, from the institute, which is at the University of Oxford, said: ""Our findings support the notion that having proportionally more fat around the abdomen (a characteristic of the apple shape) appears to be more hazardous than more visceral fat, which is generally stored around the hips (the pear shape)."" She said that ""looking at how fat tissue is distributed in the body - especially in women -  can give us more insight into the risk of heart attack than measures of general obesity"". Dr Peters added: ""Understanding the role sex differences in body fat distribution play in future health problems could lead to sex-specific public health interventions that could address the global obesity epidemic more effectively."" Heart attack care dangerously unequal for women, study finds Anti-inflammatory drug 'cuts heart attack risk' Cardiologist: Breast implants skew heart attack test The report said that body composition and fat distribution differed markedly between the sexes, with women having a predominance of fat mass and subcutaneous fat and men having lean mass and visceral fat. It added: ""Our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large sample size, and direct measurement of general and central adiposity on all participants. ""However, the UK Biobank is a largely white population, and further analyses are needed to determine the generalisability to other populations."" chest pain - a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing in the centre of your chest pain in other parts of the body - it can feel as if the pain is travelling from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm is affected, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and abdomen feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling or being sick overwhelming sense of anxiety (similar to having a panic attack) coughing or wheezing Although the chest pain is often severe, some people may feel only minor pain, similar to indigestion. In some cases, there may not be any chest pain at all, especially in women, the elderly and people with diabetes. Source: NHS Choices,external Ashleigh Doggett, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Considering the large amount of UK participants, this is a very interesting study which highlights that obesity remains a risk factor for heart attacks in both men and women. ""Interestingly, it suggests that those of us who are 'apple' as opposed to 'pear' shape, especially women, may be at higher risk of a heart attack. ""We know from previous BHF research that women are often misdiagnosed initially when having a heart attack so how we store fat and our body shape may be an important factor for medical staff to consider when making a diagnosis.

Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail,"One of the UK's biggest electronics retailers has collapsed into administration after talks with buyers failed to secure a sale. Maplin, which has more than 200 stores and 2,300 staff, will continue to trade through the process. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence and a withdrawal of credit insurance. These factors made it ""impossible"" to raise capital, boss Graham Harris said. The news came shortly afterretailer Toys R Us went into administration. ""We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the High Street and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere,"" Mr Harris said. Maplin will now work with administrators PwC ""to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders"", Mr Harris added. PwC said it would ""explore all opportunities to find a new owner"". Stores will open as normal during this time, and there are no plans to close shops or make redundancies at the moment, PwC said. Any outstanding customer orders will be delivered, while gift cards will continue to be accepted in stores for the present, it added. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ""The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. ""Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened,"" he said. ""Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration."" Maplin has 2,335 staff, 217 stores and an annual turnover of Â£235.8m. It operates in the UK and Ireland and has head offices in London and Rotherham. It began as a mail-order business in 1972, providing electronic components to hobbyists. Maplin opened its first shop in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex in 1976. After changing hands several times, the chain has been owned by Rutland Partners since 2014. Potential buyers had included Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the clothing company that owns Peacocks, Country Casuals and several other retailers. However, talks are understood to have broken down. High Street chains have been badly affected by lower consumer spending, higher inflation and competition from online rivals.

Scotland on red alert,"Traffic on the M80 between Glasgow and Stirling was brought to a standstill for several hours as emergency services worked to clear a series of accidents A red alert for snow is in force for many of Scotland's most highly-populated areas as blizzard conditions left some motorists stranded for hours on roads in the central belt. Trains, flights and many bus services in the affected areas have stopped. Driving conditions are treacherous, and people have been told not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary. The red warning of major disruption and potential risk to life will be in place until 10:00 on Thursday. It covers Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside, Fife and Central, as well as parts of south east Scotland and the Borders. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland that the country was experiencing ""unprecedented weather"" with many people saying it was the worst snow they had ever seen. Some gritters on the M80 and A720 were given a police escort to help them get through traffic to treat problem areas, with a series of minor accidents causing long tailbacks that left cars at a standstill for several hours. Live updates as red warning in force Where to find updates on school closures In pictures: Best shots from around the UK Video: Scotland hit by Beast from the East Red Cross gives bedding to passengers One of those stuck on the M80 was Michael Blair, who said he had stopped for fuel at Old Inns, near Cumbernauld, at about 14:30 and had moved less than a mile in the four hours since. Mr Blair, who was trying to get to Perthshire, said: ""We have no idea how long we are going to be here."" The emergency services stopped any other vehicles going onto the road as they worked to clear the tailbacks. Glasgow Airport will be closed to all flights until at least 11:00 on Thursday,with about 200 people said to still be inside the terminal on Wednesday evening. Employers had been encouraged to send staff home early ahead of the red warning coming into effect at 15:00 on Wednesday. It is the first time a red alert for snow has ever been issued in Scotland, and only the second time anywhere in the UK. A satellite image showed snow covering most of the UK A red warning means extreme weather is expected, with people urged to take immediate action to keep themselves and others safe from the impact of the weather. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely, and people must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. The warning came after the so-called Beast from the East caused major problems across most of Scotland earlier on Wednesday, with more than 1,600 schools shut and transport badly affected. About 11cm (4in) of snow had fallen in the centre of Glasgow by lunchtime on Tuesday, with First Bus saying its services in the city and surrounding areas would stop by 16:00, while Lothian Buses stopped its services at 19:00. The British Red Cross has used specially equipped 4x4 vehicles to supply bedding for people at Glasgow Airport in case passengers are stranded overnight. Other airports, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen, have also seen disruption. No trains will run on the West Coast Main Line between Scotland and England until at least lunchtime on Thursday, and the Forth Road Bridge has been closed to all traffic, with vehicles being diverted to the Queensferry Crossing. And Glasgow's subway system closed at 19:00 to allow staff to go home. Motorists have been told to only take to the roads if it is absolutely necessary The Met Office said: ""Heavy snow showers and drifting of lying snow in the strong easterly winds will become more widespread across the area later on Wednesday afternoon, through the evening and overnight into Thursday. ""Roads will become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. Long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel are expected."" It also said some rural communities could become cut off for several day, and warned of the potential for long interruptions to power supplies and other services. Mr Yousaf said the authorities were doing their best to get gritters to the worst affected areas, with emergency services ensuring that people stuck on roads such as the M80 had enough provisions. Speaking to the Reporting Scotland programme, he said people had heeded warnings not to travel ""to an extent"", with traffic much lighter than would normally be the case and many employers being ""extremely flexible"" in allowing staff to go home early or work from home. But he added: ""I have seen HGVs that are carrying home furniture, stationery and piping. I am not convinced that is necessary, and a lot of the incidents we have seen have been caused by a loss of traction by HGVs, so not everybody has been listening or heeding that advice."" Mr Yousaf stressed: ""The advice still remains - please avoid all travel not only if you are in the red warning area, but also if you are in the amber warning area which we know doesn't finish until Thursday at 6pm."" About 11cm (4in) of snow has fallen in Glasgow All 11 SPFL football matches scheduled for Wednesday evening have been cancelled. More than 450,000 pupils were off school on Wednesday, with the vast majority to remain closed on Thursday. Parents should check their local council's website and social media pages for updates. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has said it is cancelling all routine elective procedures and outpatient appointments on Thursday because of the weather conditions, although emergency and essential elective procedures will still go ahead. Staff managed to clear the runway at Glasgow Airport briefly, but flights remain cancelled Rail services have stopped in areas covered by the red warning Several universities are also closed, including Glasgow, Strathclyde and Stirling. About 27,000 homes in Aberdeenshire were left without power for less than an hour on Wednesday morning, but Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said this had not been due to the weather. Virgin Trains said the route between Carlisle and Scotland is closed with no trains or replacement buses running, because of the weather. Alternative rail routes between England and Scotland are also ""severely disrupted"". The current Met Office warning system came into force in 2011, after heavy snow in December of the previous year left motorists stranded overnight on the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh. This is the ninth red weather warning of any type for anywhere in the UK since then, and only the second ever red snow warning in the UK - and the first issued for snow in Scotland. The last red warning was on 29 January 2016 for storm force winds across Orkney and Shetland On 26 December 2015 a red alert for heavy rain was issued across Lancashire and Yorkshire. 5 December 2015 for heavy rain across parts of Cumbria and the Scottish Borders (Storm Desmond) 12 February 2014 for severe gales across Wales and northern England 18 January 2013 for snow in south Wales 7 July 2012 for rain in south west Devon and east Cornwall 3 January 2012 for storm force winds in the Central Belt of Scotland 8 December 2011 for severe gales in central and southern Scotland Police Scotland also repeated its advice for people not to travel. Ch Supt Stewart Carles, head of the force's road policing unit, said: ""The warning covers the commuter periods both this evening and tomorrow morning. ""So we would ask people to think very carefully about making alternative arrangements for these times and to consider whether they really need to make that journey, particularly on the road network which may become overwhelmed as people leave work early to beat the storm. ""We'd urge employers to be as flexible as possible in terms of their staff perhaps not being able being able to come to their normal places of work and to consider alternatives.""

UK's transition offer to EU nationalsThe UK government says EU citizens arriving after Brexit day will be able to apply to stay permanently.1h40 minutes agoUK Politics,"EU nationals who arrive in the UK during the transition period after Brexit will be eligible for indefinite leave to remain, the government says. Sources say it is a compromise offer to the EU which wants citizens to have exactly the same rights as they do now during the transition period. It means free movement of people is effectively set to continue until the end of the two year or so transition. But the UK says new arrivals should not expect all the same rights as now. The EU wants the transition period - which is intended to smooth the way to the future post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK says it should last around two years from March 2019. May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft May to fight post-Brexit residency move Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major Brexit: All you need to know Those arriving in the UK after 29 March 2019, the day Britain leaves the EU, will have to register with the authorities if they want to stay longer than three months. They will then be allowed to stay for five years ""working, studying or being self-sufficient"" to qualify to apply for indefinite leave to remain, part of the process of becoming a UK citizen. EU citizens who have been continually living in the EU for five years by 29 March 2019 will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting ""settled status"". They will be able to bring spouses and other family members to the UK automatically under EU free movement rules. Those who arrive after Brexit day will also be able to bring family members to the UK under free movement rules, during the transition period. But - in the main change to the current arrangements - when the transition period has ended they will have to abide by the rules that currently apply to British citizens who want to be joined by family members from outside the EU, such as the minimum income requirement. Since July 2012, UK citizens and settled residents applying to bring a non-EU partner to the country must be earning at least Â£18,600 per year before tax. The threshold is higher for those who are also sponsoring children. Asked how the Home Office proposals differed from free movement - something Theresa May has always insisted will end in March next year - the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We'll have a registration system and some of their rights will be different. ""When we leave EU the free movement directive doesn't apply but during the implementation period people will be free to come and live, work and study here. It's for Brussels to respond, this is us setting out our position."" The Home Office is encouraging EU member states to ""mirror"" these rules for UK citizens moving to EU member states during transition. But in a major sticking point with the EU, the UK is insisting EU citizens arriving in the UK during transition must have their rights defined and interpreted solely in UK law and through the UK courts. British judges will not be able to refer questions of interpretation to the European Court of Justice, the Home Office says. Irish citizens will not be subject to the agreement and therefore will not need to register,the Home Office says in fact sheet explaining the changes,external. When the transition period has ended, the UK will put in place a new immigration system which the Home Office says will ""strengthen control of our borders and address the public's concerns about the impacts of unrestricted immigration from the EU on jobs, wages and public services"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ""We have been pressing the Home Office for some time to clarify the arrangements for EU citizens arriving during the transition period so it is sensible that they have finally done so. ""But they should be a bit more straight with people. This new paper reiterates the prime minister's line that the expectations of EU citizens arriving in the UK after our exit will not be the same as those who moved here before our withdrawal, yet it then goes on to provide a long list of ways in which arrangements will be exactly the same. ""The clock is ticking and there isn't time to negotiate or implement an entirely new system of immigration or citizens' rights by March 2019 and they shouldn't suggest that things will change next year when they won't.""

"Universities told to give strike refundsStudents should get money back for strike-hit lectures, says university minister.2h2 hours agoFamily & Education","The universities minister says students should have refunds for lessons lost to strikes The universities minister says students whose courses have been disrupted by the university strike should receive compensation for lost classes. Sam Gyimah said this could mean a refund on tuition fees or rearranging cancelled lectures. At the launch of a new higher education regulator, Mr Gyimah told universities this was the ""age of the student"" and they deserved better value for money. King's College London says it will have a fund to compensate students. The university says that it will ring-fence any savings from staff pay on strike days and use the money to ""offset the impact of the strike on our students"". A King's spokeswoman said they would be ""considering cases for any further compensation that may be warranted in light of cancelled classes"". Mr Gyimah also called on university staff to suspend their strike action, ahead of talks with employers. The universities minister, speaking in Westminster at the launch of the Office for Students, said he was ""very serious"" about universities paying back students who had missed out on classesduring the strike over pensions. He said that the wages saved by universities because of the strike could be used to support students, rather than kept by institutions. Universities UK did not want to respond to calls for refunds, but said: ""The focus of universities is on making every effort to work with students to minimise disruption to their academic experience."" Mr Gyimah spoke of the importance of students getting what they expected from their courses, whether in teaching hours or the facilities that had been promised. He told university leaders that they might feel as though this had been an ""annus horribilis"", with intense scrutiny of vice-chancellors' pay and university funding. Sam Gyimah says this is the ""age of the student"", whose rights need to be protected But Mr Gyimah told them there were no ""calmer times ahead"", because this tougher accountability was now the new landscape of higher education. ""This is not a blip. We are once again experiencing the 'winds of change' in the university sector,"" Mr Gyimah told university heads. Establishing the Office for Students was part of this greater scrutiny, he said. ""Gone are the days when students venerated institutions and were thankful to be admitted. We are in a new age - the age of the student."" But on the level of tuition fees being charged in England, Mr Gyimah appeared to rule out the idea that different subjects, such as science, might have higher fees than arts subjects. Instead he argued that there should be more diversity in how courses were delivered - such as studying for a degree in two years rather than three. The idea of scrapping fees completely was ""snake oil"", he said. ""If it's free, numbers will be capped,"" he said, arguing that fewer places would mean a narrowing of access for poorer applicants. Mr Gyimah was speaking in the second week of a university strike, in which staff have walked out over proposed cuts to their pensions. The UCU university staff union is set to enter conciliation talks with university representatives on Monday. The union's leader Sally Hunt said that they had put forward ""sensible, affordable proposals aimed at resolving the dispute"".

Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major,"This video can not be played Major: MPs could order another referendum MPs should be given a free vote on whether to accept or reject the final Brexit deal, Sir John Major has said. The ex-prime minister argues that MPs must vote with their ""own conscience"" on whether the deal on offer will leave the UK better or worse off. And, in a speech in London, he said they could decide on a new referendum. Leading Tory backbencher and Brexit backer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Sir John had been wrong on Europe in the past ""and he is getting it wrong again"". ""We had a democratic vote, the decision has been taken and what he is trying to do is overturn that,"" he told BBC News. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Sir John insisted he was not ""targeting"" Theresa May and he genuinely wished her well in getting the best deal for Britain. This video can not be played In full: Sir John Major speaks to Laura Kuenssberg But he said some of the advice she was getting from within her own party was ""very unwelcome from the point of view of the wellbeing of the country"". Sir John, whose time as Conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1997 featured long-running battles with Eurosceptics in his party, has long been a critic of the UK's decision to leave the EU, having campaigned alongside David Cameron on the Remain side in the 2016 referendum. Brexit has become the most ""divisive"" political issue of his lifetime, he said in the speech to the Creative Industries Federation. Laura Kuenssberg: A Brexit warning from PM to PM May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft UK's transition offer to EU nationals He said the promises made by Leave campaigners during the referendum had yet to be met and were unlikely to be, describing the aspiration to spend an extra Â£350m a week on the NHS as a ""ridiculous phantom"". ""Many electors know they were misled: Many more are beginning to realise it. So, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision."" Sir John challenged what he said was the argument Brexit would have little impact on the UK, arguing that while the British people would ""get through it"", it was likely to leave the country ""weaker and less prosperous"" and a ""diminished"" force on the world stage. Given the emerging evidence that Brexit will ""hurt most those who have the least"", he said the government must ""change course"" and rethink its negotiating strategy, based on what was practically achievable rather than what he said were the demands of a ""minority of ultra-Brexiteers"". This video can not be played Major's 'Damascene conversion' to free votes - IDS While he did not enjoy being ""out of step"" with his party, the stakes were so high than he felt obliged to speak out at such a crucial moment in the negotiations. ""Leaving Europe is an issue so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it will have an impact on all our lives - most especially on the young and the future,"" he said. ""With only 12 months to go, we need answers, not aspirations."" While he was not actively calling for a further referendum, he said the ""option"" must remain open to a ""sovereign"" Parliament to insist upon. The ""meaningful"" vote promised by Theresa May on the final agreement must be ""a decisive vote, in which Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators back to seek improvements; or order a referendum so the public may approve what has been determined"". ""Brexit is a unique decision,"" he added. ""It will affect the lives of the British nation for generations to come.  If it flops - there will be the most terrible backlash. ""If Brexit is whipped through Parliament, at a time when the public are so divided about it, voters will know who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and prudence suggest a free vote. Eurosceptics say Sir John did not brook any dissent when he was prime minister ""The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely approved by Parliament, than a Brexit forced through Parliament at the behest of a minority of convinced opponents of Europe."" Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the speech, he insisted he was not ""targeting"" Theresa May and he genuinely wished her well in securing her aims. ""What I said was that there are people with ultra-Brexit views who are trying to stamp those views on the government because the parliamentary arithmetic Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the idea of another referendum was ""rather absurd"". ""We have to leave because the British people have said we should leave and we have to make the arrangements we can,"" he said. ""We have had a referendum, they have spoken and I think that is enough."" Mr Rees-Mogg suggested the former PM was talking ""complete humbug"" over the issue as rather than permitting free votes during the Maastricht battles of the early 1990s, Eurosceptic rebels were subject to the ""most aggressive"" form of whipping, with many being effectively thrown out of the party. ""You would expect John Major, a former prime minister, to make a statesmanlike speech, free of propaganda and cheap comments, when in fact, it's all cheap comments and propaganda,"" he said. ""This isn't a statesmanlike speech, this is one of somebody grubbing around in the weeds for weak arguments and it's a very poor speech in that regard.""

""Many electors know they were misled: Many more are beginning to realise it. So, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision."" Sir John challenged what he said was the argument Brexit would have little impact on the UK, arguing that while the British people would ""get through it"", it was likely to leave the country ""weaker and less prosperous"" and a ""diminished"" force on the world stage. Given the emerging evidence that Brexit will ""hurt most those who have the least"", he said the government must ""change course"" and rethink its negotiating strategy, based on what was practically achievable rather than what he said were the demands of a ""minority of ultra-Brexiteers"". This video can not be played Major's 'Damascene conversion' to free votes - IDS While he did not enjoy being ""out of step"" with his party, the stakes were so high than he felt obliged to speak out at such a crucial moment in the negotiations. ""Leaving Europe is an issue so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it will have an impact on all our lives - most especially on the young and the future,"" he said. ""With only 12 months to go, we need answers, not aspirations."" While he was not actively calling for a further referendum, he said the ""option"" must remain open to a ""sovereign"" Parliament to insist upon. The ""meaningful"" vote promised by Theresa May on the final agreement must be ""a decisive vote, in which Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators back to seek improvements; or order a referendum so the public may approve what has been determined"". ""Brexit is a unique decision,"" he added. ""It will affect the lives of the British nation for generations to come.  If it flops - there will be the most terrible backlash. ""If Brexit is whipped through Parliament, at a time when the public are so divided about it, voters will know who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and prudence suggest a free vote. Eurosceptics say Sir John did not brook any dissent when he was prime minister ""The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely approved by Parliament, than a Brexit forced through Parliament at the behest of a minority of convinced opponents of Europe."" Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the speech, he insisted he was not ""targeting"" Theresa May and he genuinely wished her well in securing her aims. ""What I said was that there are people with ultra-Brexit views who are trying to stamp those views on the government because the parliamentary arithmetic Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the idea of another referendum was ""rather absurd"". ""We have to leave because the British people have said we should leave and we have to make the arrangements we can,"" he said. ""We have had a referendum, they have spoken and I think that is enough."" Mr Rees-Mogg suggested the former PM was talking ""complete humbug"" over the issue as rather than permitting free votes during the Maastricht battles of the early 1990s, Eurosceptic rebels were subject to the ""most aggressive"" form of whipping, with many being effectively thrown out of the party. ""You would expect John Major, a former prime minister, to make a statesmanlike speech, free of propaganda and cheap comments, when in fact, it's all cheap comments and propaganda,"" he said. ""This isn't a statesmanlike speech, this is one of somebody grubbing around in the weeds for weak arguments and it's a very poor speech in that regard.""

TV drama 'too male' say women writersAn open letter asks why there are so few female writers working on major TV dramas.6m6 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts,"Call the Midwife was used as an example of a rare show with female writers More than 70 female TV writers have signed a letter accusing drama bosses of not giving them opportunities to work on primetime shows. The open letter, which claims British drama is ""overwhelmingly written by men"", was signed by 76 scriptwriters. They said they felt ""confusion and anger"" at the lack of work by women reaching the screen in top TV dramas. The BBC and ITV came in for criticism, but both pointed to a number of major programmes with female writers. The letter, which was published by Broadcast,external, said: ""The gap between being commissioned and being produced seems disproportionately large when it comes to women's work."" The signatories - who have written for shows like EastEnders, Emmerdale and Midsomer Murders - vented the ""pain and frustration"" of not seeing more women in the highest echelons of television drama. The BBC said there would be more female writers in the new series of Doctor Who The letter alludes to anarticle on Cultbox,external, which detailed nine new ITV dramas for 2018. ""Of the nine new dramas listed, only one had a female lead writer,"" the letter said. ""In fairness, the article was by no means definitive, as since it was published, ITV has announced two further dramas for 2018. Both by male writers. ""That suggests that less than 10% of new drama greenlit by ITV for this year will be written by women. Perhaps you can now understand our rage?"" The letter said the BBC's Silent Witness had employed only five female writers during its 20-year run, and criticised Doctor Who for having five series written entirely by men. Call the Midwife was used as an example of a rare hit drama with a female writing team. The letter pointed out that there were plenty of women in the ""boot camps of TV writing"", such as soaps. Soap operas ""demand unrelenting creativity, consistency and a photographic memory for years of story and enormous casts of characters"", the letter said. ""And yet these talented and hard-working female writers remain an untapped resource."" Women, it said, simply aren't ""graduating onto next-level shows where they could develop their skills further and raise their profiles"". The letter conceded: ""It is encouraging that many of the new ITV dramas have female characters front and centre. It is great to see that women's stories are now being told. It's just that we feel we might be better qualified to tell our own stories."" In response, the BBC said: ""Women have written more than 40% of the drama BBC One's head of drama Piers Wenger has ordered since taking up the role a year ago."" Highlighting writers like Anna Symon, who recently scored her first original series - BBC One's The Wilsons - Wenger said: ""It used to be that continuing drama was the only place to get a BBC One gig as a new writer, but it's not as binary as that now."" Wenger also revealed that women had written ""a number"" of the scripts for Chris Chibnall's forthcoming debut series of Doctor Who. ""Having a diverse team on that show feels appropriate, important and essential,"" he said. ITV's head of drama Polly Hill said: ""Recent drama on ITV - Bancroft, Victoria, Next of Kin, Girlfriends and Vera - have all had female writers, with strong female leads. ""The list referred to does not represent the full picture of ITV commissions. We have four new dramas written by women that have not been announced yet, as well as female writers working on forthcoming returning series."" She added: ""As we look to offer audiences the greatest range of drama, we will always support and commission female writers and take representation on and off screen seriously.""

Toys R Us UK goes into administration,"Toys R Us has gone into administration, putting 3,000 UK jobs at risk. Administrators have been appointed to begin ""an orderly wind-down"" of the UK's biggest toy retailer following the failure to find a buyer. They said that all 105 Toys R Us stores will remain open until further notice. Joint administrator Simon Thomas said: ""Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided."" Toys R Us worker: 'Bosses knew something' Five reasons Toys R Us failed Maplin collapses after rescue talks fail Business Live: Retail failures reaction Toys R Us has been facing a Â£15m tax bill. However, poor sales have made it unlikely that it can make the payment. Mr Thomas said: ""We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business. ""The newer, smaller, more interactive stores in the portfolio have been outperforming the older warehouse-style stores that were opened in the 1980s and 1990s."" A large sale of remaining products at Toys R Us is expected. The administrators said this would happen in stores only, as the online service and click-and-collect will be closed immediately. Shoppers who have ordered an item already on click-and-collect can still pick it up, but only if that item is still available in stock. Anyone with Toys R Us gift cards and vouchers should spend them in stores as soon as possible before the shops are closed down. No more gift cards will be sold. The retailer had a ""take time to pay"" service, which allowed customers to reserve a product and then pay for it gradually for 12 weeks, before picking it up. The administrators said these reservations would be honoured, provided that the outstanding balance was paid and the goods collected by 11 March. Alternatively, customers can use their deposits towards the cost of any other item bought in a store by 11 March. The UK arm of Toys R Us - its US owner filed for bankruptcy protection last September - managed to stave off administration in December after it struck an agreement with the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) to inject Â£9.8m into its retirement scheme over three years. The scheme has a shortfall of Â£38m which will now be transferred over to the PPF. People who have already retired will receive 100% of their pension payments, while whose still working will get 90%. Andy McKinnon, acting chief executive at the PPF, said: ""We will now be working to maximise the recovery to the scheme from the administration. Members of the Toys R Us pension scheme can be reassured that the PPF is there to protect them."" Maplin, the electronics retailer, has also filed for administration, putting 2,500 jobs in danger. The struggling business had been attempting to find a buyer, but its chief executive Graham Harris said it had ""not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result, we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process"". Julie Palmer, regional managing partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said Toys R Us had ""fallen foul of a perfect storm hitting bricks-and-mortar retailers across the board"". She said: ""Rising costs from the National Living Wage, apprenticeship levy and inflation, combined with ongoing pressure on consumer spending and the continued rise of the internet are hitting retailers with a big High Street presence hard."" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""Ultimately this is a necessary shakeout of some pretty out-dated retailers, which though terrible for those affected by job losses, is likely to mean a leaner, fitter retail market and a more productive use of capital. ""The question is whether there are more out there that could fall by the wayside."" Retail is tough right now, even for the strong players. Toys R Us has made a loss seven out of the last eight financial years. It is a subsidiary of a US business which has been drowning in billions of dollars of debt. Financially weak, Toys R Us has been unable to adapt to changing shopping habits. These days, many shoppers don't want or need to drive 20 minutes to a big out-of-town warehouse to buy toys. Costs have been rising for all retailers and consumer demand has been softening. It's a combination which is putting pressure on many retailers and the weaker ones are particularly exposed. Toys R Us was once the disrupter, a so-called category killer. Now many are wondering if it can survive in the UK and in what form.

Ex-soldier guilty of dog walker's murder,"Peter Wrighton's body was found near Fiveways Junction, three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk A ""callous"" ex-soldier has been convicted of murdering an 83-year-old dog walker in an ""animalistic"" attack. Alexander Palmer, 24, stabbed Peter Wrighton from behind 45 times before dragging his body under brambles in woodland in Norfolk in August 2017. Det Supt Marina Ericson described Palmer as a ""dangerous individual"". Mr Wrighton's daughter Carole Todd said mental health professionals had ""failed"" Palmer and her family and believed the murder was preventable. Ms Ericson, who led the inquiry, said Palmer was ""callous and extremely calculated in his approach to Peter's death"". ""Officers first on the scene described the incident as an animal attack and I think that description is still accurate,"" she said. ""Palmer is a dangerous individual who was truly animalistic in his actions."" This video can not be played The jury took 49 minutes to convict Alexander Palmer Palmer, of Freesia Way, Cringleford, will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday. Mr Justice Goose delayed sentencing to allow Mr Wrighton's widow to attend and said it was ""inevitable"" Palmer would receive a life sentence. Palmer mouthed the words ""I love you"" to his family as the judge sent him down to the cells. He showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict after 49 minutes of deliberations. Palmer had previously admitted being in the area at the time of the attack but denied murder. During the trial the court heard police were initially unaware of Palmer and concluded the victim had been attacked and killed near East Harling on 5 August by some sort of animal, due to his throat injuries. But a psychologist who had treated Palmer at RAF Marham read press reports of the case. She contacted the force telling them she thought he could be responsible for the death. Prosecutor Stephen Spence said Palmer told medical professionals a voice in his head called ""Little Alex"" instructed him to harm people or kill them. Palmer was injured as a victim of an assault while serving in the Army, where he served in a commando regiment, the prosecution said. He left in November 2015. Peter Wrighton's body was discovered on the edge of the heath by walkers The incident appeared to trigger problems which required mental health treatment, Mr Spence said. He said Palmer had told hospital staff: ""I will plan out the method in my head, go to the desired place where I wish the scene to be set and then I will carry out the act of hurting someone. ""It could be anyone that it happens to."" Mr Spence said: ""Particularly of note was his desire to kill strangers - dog walkers seemed to be a particular bugbear of his."" The court heard forensic samples from Palmer, a trainee pathology laboratory services technician, were discovered on a trouser leg belonging to Mr Wrighton. ""Neither of these two people were known to each other,"" he said, and any idea that DNA was transferred via Mr Wrighton's dogs was ""simply fanciful"". Mr Wrighton's daughter Carole Todd said she was concerned at mental health failures Ms Todd said outside court the revelations about Palmer's mental health history had ""shocked, astounded and angered us"". In a statement on behalf of the family, she said: ""Evidently an intelligent person, he was able to take himself off medication and get himself discharged from care. ""We feel this should not have happened and mental health professionals failed him, his family and our family. ""My mum, brother, myself and our children not only feel grief but anger, as we believe this crime could have been prevented."" A spokeswoman for the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services, said: ""The trust can confirm that staff did, on more than one occasion, liaise closely with other organisations including the police to raise concerns. Police said Palmer took this selfie shortly after killing Mr Wrighton ""A full investigation incorporating the various agencies which have been involved in this matter is now likely to take place."" The trust said staff ""acted appropriately at all times with full and proper consideration to the safety"" of Palmer ""as well as to the safety of others"".

M1 fatal crash lorry driver 'felt faint',"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash during the August Bank Holiday weekend A driver accused of causing a crash that killed eight minibus passengers stopped on the M1 carriageway because he felt faint, he told a court. Ryszard Masierak, 32, drew his lorry to a halt near Newport Pagnell on 26 August 2017 and said he was ""sweating, felt weakness and had a headache"". Asked whether his headache was because he was drunk he replied ""no"". Mr Masierak and another lorry driver, David Wagstaff, deny eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. Reading Crown Courthad previously been told Mr Masierak was twice the legal alcohol limitwhen he had stopped in the inside lane at 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Mr Masierak admitted to the court he had drunk alcohol in the hours before the crash but told the jury his drinking had nothing to do with the collision. Ryszard Masierak's supervisor previously told the court he appeared normal when he started his shift When asked by prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC whether he felt any sense of responsibility for what happened, Mr Masierak replied: ""I'm simply sorry for those people who died."" The Polish national told the jury he slowed his lorry down and put his hazard lights on before losing consciousness. He admitted to the court he could have come off at the junction before but he said he ""knew something bad was happening to me"". Through a Polish interpreter, he told the jury: ""This slip road was in the distance as if some mist was in my eyes. Instead of seeing one lane I could see two."" He said he did attempt to pull on to the hard shoulder to stop. ""I fell to the floor between the passenger seat and the driver's seat. Then I lost consciousness and do not remember anything from then on - not the force of the impact,"" he added. While his vehicle was stopped, the court hasheard a lorry being driven by Mr Wagstaff  - who was on a hands-free call at the time - ploughed into the back of the minibusforcing it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle. Mr Wagstaff also gave evidence on Wednesday and, occasionally upset, said he ""cannot remember anything at all"" about the collision. David Wagstaff was on a hands-free call when he crashed into the minibus The jury heard there was no evidence of Mr Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, braking or trying to turn the wheel before the crash. Mr Wagstaff told the court: ""I do remember saying, 'It's my fault, I have done it' but I cannot remember too much of anything else."" His lawyer, Gillian Jones QC said Mr Wagstaff told a police officer: ""I'm going to prison. I have seen it often enough. I was on the telephone."" Mr Wagstaff said he does not recall this conversation but added those words ""definitely"" sound like something he would say. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph, who was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around the lorry, and seven of his passengers were killed in the crash. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph Four others, including a four-year-old girl, were seriously injured. They were on their way from Nottingham to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris on the Bank Holiday weekend. Mr Masierak told the jury it felt like he had been in a ""small coma"" when he woke up following the collision. Mr Masierak, of Barnards Close in Evesham, Worcestershire, and Mr Wagstaff, 54, of Derwent Street in Stoke-on-Trent, both also deny four charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving charges, while Mr Masierak faces an additional charge of drink-driving.

Waist size 'bigger heart risk in women',"Women with bigger waists relative to their hips are at more risk of heart attacks than men of a similar ""apple shape"", research from the George Institute for Global Health says. The study showed waist-to-hip ratio to be a better heart attack predictor than general obesity - 18% stronger than body mass index in women and 6% in men. The report found a high BMI was linked to heart disease risk in both sexes. The researchers interviewed nearly 500,000 UK adults aged 40 to 69. The researchhas been published in the Journal of the American Heart Association,externaland used the UK Biobank resource. Dr Sanne Peters, the report's lead author, from the institute, which is at the University of Oxford, said: ""Our findings support the notion that having proportionally more fat around the abdomen (a characteristic of the apple shape) appears to be more hazardous than more visceral fat, which is generally stored around the hips (the pear shape)."" She said that ""looking at how fat tissue is distributed in the body - especially in women -  can give us more insight into the risk of heart attack than measures of general obesity"". Dr Peters added: ""Understanding the role sex differences in body fat distribution play in future health problems could lead to sex-specific public health interventions that could address the global obesity epidemic more effectively."" Heart attack care dangerously unequal for women, study finds Anti-inflammatory drug 'cuts heart attack risk' Cardiologist: Breast implants skew heart attack test The report said that body composition and fat distribution differed markedly between the sexes, with women having a predominance of fat mass and subcutaneous fat and men having lean mass and visceral fat. It added: ""Our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large sample size, and direct measurement of general and central adiposity on all participants. ""However, the UK Biobank is a largely white population, and further analyses are needed to determine the generalisability to other populations."" chest pain - a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing in the centre of your chest pain in other parts of the body - it can feel as if the pain is travelling from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm is affected, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and abdomen feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling or being sick overwhelming sense of anxiety (similar to having a panic attack) coughing or wheezing Although the chest pain is often severe, some people may feel only minor pain, similar to indigestion. In some cases, there may not be any chest pain at all, especially in women, the elderly and people with diabetes. Source: NHS Choices,external Ashleigh Doggett, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Considering the large amount of UK participants, this is a very interesting study which highlights that obesity remains a risk factor for heart attacks in both men and women. ""Interestingly, it suggests that those of us who are 'apple' as opposed to 'pear' shape, especially women, may be at higher risk of a heart attack. ""We know from previous BHF research that women are often misdiagnosed initially when having a heart attack so how we store fat and our body shape may be an important factor for medical staff to consider when making a diagnosis. ""The study highlights the need for similar research amongst more diverse populations, and for further research into sex differences which could lead the way in treating patients on an individualised basis.""

Police examine new Weinstein allegation,"Harvey Weinstein, pictured in 2013, was one of Hollywood's most powerful men A 10th woman has reported Harvey Weinstein to British police for alleged sexual assault. The woman, who has not been named, went to the police on 8 February to accuse the movie mogul of assaulting her in central London in the mid-1990s. The Metropolitan Police has now received a total of 15 complaints against Weinstein from the 10 women, dating from the early 1980s to 2015. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Scotland Yard said: ""Officers from the Met's Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command have received allegations of sexual assault from 10 victims under Operation Kaguyak."" It added: ""On 8 February an allegation was received that the man sexually assaulted a woman (Victim 10) in Westminster in the mid-1990s.""

Students 'should get refund over strike',"The universities minister says students should have refunds for lessons lost to strikes The universities minister says students whose courses have been disrupted by the university strike should receive compensation for lost classes. Sam Gyimah said this could mean a refund on tuition fees or rearranging cancelled lectures. At the launch of a new higher education regulator, Mr Gyimah told universities this was the ""age of the student"" and they deserved better value for money. King's College London says it will have a fund to compensate students. The university says that it will ring-fence any savings from staff pay on strike days and use the money to ""offset the impact of the strike on our students"". A King's spokeswoman said they would be ""considering cases for any further compensation that may be warranted in light of cancelled classes"". Mr Gyimah also called on university staff to suspend their strike action, ahead of talks with employers. The universities minister, speaking in Westminster at the launch of the Office for Students, said he was ""very serious"" about universities paying back students who had missed out on classesduring the strike over pensions. He said that the wages saved by universities because of the strike could be used to support students, rather than kept by institutions. Universities UK did not want to respond to calls for refunds, but said: ""The focus of universities is on making every effort to work with students to minimise disruption to their academic experience."" Mr Gyimah spoke of the importance of students getting what they expected from their courses, whether in teaching hours or the facilities that had been promised. He told university leaders that they might feel as though this had been an ""annus horribilis"", with intense scrutiny of vice-chancellors' pay and university funding. Sam Gyimah says this is the ""age of the student"", whose rights need to be protected But Mr Gyimah told them there were no ""calmer times ahead"", because this tougher accountability was now the new landscape of higher education. ""This is not a blip. We are once again experiencing the 'winds of change' in the university sector,"" Mr Gyimah told university heads. Establishing the Office for Students was part of this greater scrutiny, he said. ""Gone are the days when students venerated institutions and were thankful to be admitted. We are in a new age - the age of the student."" But on the level of tuition fees being charged in England, Mr Gyimah appeared to rule out the idea that different subjects, such as science, might have higher fees than arts subjects. Instead he argued that there should be more diversity in how courses were delivered - such as studying for a degree in two years rather than three. The idea of scrapping fees completely was ""snake oil"", he said. ""If it's free, numbers will be capped,"" he said, arguing that fewer places would mean a narrowing of access for poorer applicants. Mr Gyimah was speaking in the second week of a university strike, in which staff have walked out over proposed cuts to their pensions. The UCU university staff union is set to enter conciliation talks with university representatives on Monday. The union's leader Sally Hunt said that they had put forward ""sensible, affordable proposals aimed at resolving the dispute"".

Row over racist Mosley election leaflet,"Privacy campaigner Max Mosley published a by-election leaflet saying: ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health,"" it has been claimed. The 1961 leaflet, backing a candidate for his father Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, wasfound by the Daily Mail in archives in Manchester,external. The newspaper says it raises questions over Mr Mosley's evidence to a 2008 High Court trial. Mr Mosley said he didn't recall the leaflet and he was not a racist. In evidence to the 2008 trial, in which he successfully sued the News of the World over reports about a sado-masochistic sex session he had had with five prostitutes, Mr Mosley denied any knowledge of the leaflet. He said he had challenged lawyers for the the now-defunct Sunday tabloid to produce the document in court, ""which they failed to do"". ""I obviously would not have done that if I knew of its existence,"" he told the Press Association. ""My record in motor-sport demonstrates that I do not tolerate racism and, like most people, my political views have changed over time."" The former Formula 1 boss was presented with a photocopy of the leaflet, for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 Moss Side by-election,during an interview with Channel 4 News,external.

The leaflet, which says it was ""published by Max Mosley"", includes the warning: ""Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD [venereal (sexually transmitted) disease] and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" It also states that ""if enough people vote for me in this election, the government... will be sending coloured immigrants home, instead of bringing more in"" and urges voters to ""let us give the coloured people a fair deal by sending them back to good jobs and good wages at home in Jamaica"". Asked about the line ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health,"" Mr Mosley said: ""I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely."" But he said he had ""no reason to apologise to anyone"", adding: ""This was a statement in a leaflet which I am not even sure is genuine, which would never reflect my view, it would not reflect my view then or now because I simply wouldn't dream of insulting people."" He told Channel 4 News: ""If that leaflet is genuine, I am responsible for it and it shouldn't have been issued"". Tom Watson's office has been funded by Max Mosley But he said: ""I have never been a racist. I am not a racist, never will be a racist."" He was also quizzed about whether he was a ""fit and proper person"" to be funding the office of Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, which has received Â£500,000 from Mr Mosley. ""Why should I not support Tom Watson, who is probably one of the most honest and courageous politicians we have got?"" he said. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Mr Watson said: ""My views on press regulation are well known and have not changed. ""The views expressed by Max as a young man are not the views he holds now, just as the Rothermere family [owners of Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Daily Mail] no longer uses its newspapers to support fascism."" Mr Mosley has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the News of the World wrongly reported his sado-masochistic sex session had been ""Nazi-themed"", and has donated funds to press regulator Impress. He is also attempting to use data protection laws to delete references to what he calls this ""private party"" and what he says are inaccurate references about his relationship to Impress. He told the Press Association he would ""continue to campaign for the vital reforms needed to protect ordinary people against the bullying of newspapers like the Daily Mail"".

'Bucket list' killer jailed for 28 years,"Police said Jemma Lilley, pictured, had tarpaulins at her house where Aaron Pajich was killed A woman who had an ""obsession"" with serial killers and had murder on her ""bucket list"" has been jailed for killing a teenager. Jemma Lilley, previously of Stamford, Lincolnshire, garrotted, stabbed and buried Aaron Pajich at her home in Perth, Australia. The 26-year-old was convicted alongside housemate Trudi Lenon at the Supreme Court of Western Australia in November. The pair have been sentenced to life with a minimum jail term of 28 years. During a four-week trial, prosecutor James McTaggart told the court Lilley was so ""full of herself and euphoric"" after the killing she could not help boasting to a work colleague. How ""euphoric"" killers' murder plot was hatched Jurors were told Lilley, who had a troubled childhood, had emigrated to Australia in 2010. She developed what prosecutors described as a long-term fascination with horror films, murder and serial killers. Lilley idolised horror film character Freddy Krueger, and had previously told a friend she wanted to kill before she turned 25. The supermarket shelf-stacker had also penned a book about a serial killer named SOS - a nickname she used during online exchanges with accomplice Lenon. Aaron Pajich's mother Sharon Pajich said he was 'my precious little boy, full of life' The pair met through a friend and became close, eventually moving in together about two months before the killing. Both women exchanged homicidal fantasies which gradually intensified until they lured Mr Pajich to his death. In the weeks before, they bought various supplies, including a circular saw and 100 litres of hydrochloric acid. Lilley's stepmother Nina said she had ""always had an obsession with serial killers"" but this had been ""a way of venting her frustration of what happened when she was a child"". Speaking to The Times after the conviction, Ms Lilley, 48, said: ""The book was a big problem with me. At the beginning I was 'fair enough you want to write a horror story', but I didn't like the contents of it."" Mr Pajich was lured to his death on 13 June 2016 and buried in a shallow grave covered with concrete and tiles, with both defendants blaming each other for the killing. Lenon, 43, told the court Lilley approached the teenager from behind as he installed games on her computer, garroted him until the wire broke then stabbed him three times. Aaron's mother Sharon Pajich said Lilley and Lenon were ""disgusting animals"" who should never be released. The pair were sentenced on Wednesday.

Toyota to build new Auris in UK,"Toyota has said it will build the next generation of its Auris hatchback at its Burnaston plant in Derbyshire. The Japanese carmakeralso said,externalits Deeside factory in North Wales would build most of its engines. It comes after Toyota promised to invest Â£240m inupgrading Burnaston last March. There are fears some carmakers could desert the UK because of Brexit if new trade barriers threaten their competitive position. Toyota said the move would secure more than 3,000 jobs across its Burnaston and Deeside plants. The car industry has warned Brexit could lead to potential tariffs on exports and disrupt its largely European supply chain. And earlier this month, industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers said investment in the UK automotive sector fell by a third last year, as companies wait for certainty over the country's future relationship with the EU. However, a number of big carmakers have committed to building more cars in the UK since the Brexit vote in June 2016. In November 2016, Nissan announced plans to build the next generation of Qashqai and X-Trail sports utility vehicles at its Sunderland factory, while BMW has said it will assemble its electric Mini in Oxford. Without doubt, it's good news for Toyota's UK plants. But an announcement like this was always likely. Toyota has already spent more than Â£2.5bn in this country, far more than at any of its other European bases. That's not the kind of investment you turn your back on. Last year, it said it would spend Â£240m preparing Burnaston to build a new generation of cars. This is the first of those new models. The company is portraying its decision as a vote of confidence in the UK. But it comes with a warning: continued free and frictionless trade with Europe will be vital for future success. In other words, it is firmly committed to the UK for now. But that commitment is not open-ended or unconditional. Dr Johan van Zyl, president of Toyota Europe, said: ""Today's announcement that we will manufacture the new Auris at Burnaston, with most engines to be supplied from Deeside, shows our confidence in the skills and capabilities of our Toyota UK members."" However, he added: ""As a company, we are doing what we can to secure the competitiveness of our UK operations as a leading manufacturing centre for our European business. The Toyota plant at Burnaston ""With around 85% of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success."" The government has also pledged to support the competitiveness of the UK sector after Brexit, and has invested Â£20m in Burnaston alongside Toyota. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Toyota's decision to build the new Auris model in Burnaston was ""testament to the highly-skilled and committed workforce that helps make the UK's automotive sector one of the most productive in the world"". A Toyota spokesman said the Auris would be built at Burnaston ""for the life of the model"". While it could not say how long that might be, typically this would last five years. The spokesman would not comment on the future of the Avensis, the other car Toyota builds in Britain, saying the firm did not comment on future product issues.

'Bullied for the way I looked',"Hannah Lewis was bullied about her appearance ""Hannah Lewis is a big, fat, lanky slag with greasy hair, a spotty face and a big nose. ""Those words haunted me throughout my adolescence,"" says Hannah, now 24. ""Being the tallest in my class and developing early meant that I was always 'different' from the other children,"" she recalls. But her experience is not uncommon, YMCA research finds, with more than half (55%) of children saying they had been bullied about the way they looked. For its research - In Your Face - the youth charity surveyed 1,006 youngsters aged 11 to 16 across the UK and carried out focus groups in 12 different UK locations. It found that of those who had experienced appearance-based taunting: 60% had tried to change the way they looked 53% said they became anxious 29% said they said they became depressed 24% said they had reduced the amount they ate ""It makes me not want to come into school and it makes it harder in lessons,"" one young person from the Vale of Glamorgan told YMCA researchers. ""With my experiences, without my mum boosting up my confidence, for me to have been able to have got through the 11 years of school, without her giving me that boost and other members of my family, I wouldn't have been able to get through it,"" said another from Nottinghamshire. For 54% of victims, the bullying had started by the age of 10. This was true for Hannah who says the taunting began at primary school. ""From the age of nine, I encountered remarks from the other children about how I already had teenage spots, how I was a 'freak' for being so tall and how old I looked for my age,"" she says. ""You take what they say as fact, so your perception of how you really look becomes distorted - you expect the truth to be what you've been told."" She says being bullied from a young age contributed to her developing body dysmorphic disorder, which is when someone becomes obsessed with imaginary defects in their appearance. 'Selfie' body image warning issued Does social media impact on body image? While therapy has helped her deal with the obsessive element of the disorder, Hannah says she still suffers with low self-esteem. ""What's helped me is focusing on my personal qualities - my skills, my abilities in my studies, my sense of humour."" The YMCA is urging secondary schools in England and Wales to make use of itsbody confidence campaign toolkit,externalwhich offers guidance, materials and advice on teaching about improving young people's body confidence. Hannah, who now volunteers for the YMCA to raise awareness about body confidence, adds: ""Difference and diversity should be celebrated, and young people should always be reminded that in the future, colleges and universities are going to look at grades, efforts and personal achievements, rather than popularity and appearance. ""We need to teach them to appreciate all the things that their body can do as opposed to just what it looks like."" Denise Hatton, chief executive of the YMCA England & Wales, says: ""Bullying has always existed among young people, but this generation face increasing pressure to live up to unrealistic beauty ideals which they say come from celebrities, social media and the media. ""It's crucial that we teach young people how to feel comfortable in their own body and that looking different isn't a bad thing. ""We know from previous research that young people who have learned about body confidence at school feel better about their bodies.""

The inquiry was set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal and ""part two"" of the inquiry was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" and the press had cleaned up its act. Labour shadow culture secretary Tom Watson condemned the decision, calling it a ""bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion"". Labour MP Chris Bryant was a victim of phone hacking and is in contact with other victims, including the family of Millie Dowler. He says many of the victims will feel that the culture secretary has ""shoved another little knife in our hearts"". House of CommonsParliament There's an early end for Commons today, to enable MPs and staff to attempt to get home through the snow. The House will next sit at 2:30pm on Monday, to put questions to defence ministers and to debate the Data Protection Bill. Future of ATMs House of CommonsParliament Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick winds up the debate, and the day's business. Mr Jenrick says the Treasury will be following this issue ""very closely in the months and and years"" to come and says the use of coinage and notes is in decline as a result of digitisation. Mr Jenrick says the government will ""protect the vulnerable"" and ensure the benefits of technology ""work for all"" in the UK. He adds that ""there are more ATMs in the UK than ever before, around 54,000 of which are free to use"", forming one of the largest networks in the world. Future of ATMs House of CommonsParliament Conservative Simon Hoare is finishing off the week with a short debate on the future of ATMs. The ATM Industry Association has warned  that thousands of free-to-use ATMs may close after cuts to fees for operators. Consumer group Which? say 200 communities in Britain already have poor ATM provision, or no cash machines at all. Mr Hoare says banks are ""very much the heart"" of rural communities and warns of the ""death of cash"".  Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Immigration minister Caroline Nokes rises to conclude the debate. She jokes that she wishes she'd had lunch first, given the wide variety of produce that has been discussed. Ms Nokes says we want to see a ""more dynamic and self-reliant"" agricultural industry as the UK continues to compete internationally, ""supplying products of the highest quality and increasing our exports"". She assures MPs that the seasonal agricultural workers scheme is ""under constant review"", referring tocomments made last weekby the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords adjourns, and will return at 2.30pm on Monday. Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Shadow home office minister Afzal Khan says there ""appears to be a consensus"" that the government needs to take some urgent action. Mr Khan says there are ""strong and compelling"" arguments for the revival of a seasonal agricultural workers scheme, which Labour would support. ""Businesses need to be able to plan for next season"", he says. Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP John Lamont emphasises the importance of seasonal workers to farming on the Scottish borders. The MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says the struggle to recruit seasonal agricultural workers is ""notably due to the drop in the pound"". Mr Lamont says the numbers of people coming from the European Union to work seasonally has been falling ""long before the EU referendum was announced"". He calls on the UK government to look closely at re-introducing the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. The scheme, allowing thousands of East European migrants to work on British farms, was closed in 2013 when labour market curbs for workers from Romania and Bulgaria were lifted. Read more about it here.  Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Keen assures peers that Sir Brian Leveson's response to the inquiry's closure will be made available for them to read. He rejects the claim that the decision amounts to a ""political deal"", saying it's a matter of ""political judgement"". He acknowledges the right of peers to return to the matter. Crossbencher Baroness Hollins, who tabled the amendment laying the groundwork for Leveson two on which the government was defeated, says she ""looks forward"" to peers returning to the Data Protection Bill. Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Shadow culture spokesman Lord Stevenson of Balmacara points out that Sir Brian Leveson believes the inquiry should continue in an amended form, arguing that without this we won't know the extent of alleged corruption between police, politicians and the media. He says the government believes it's ""sorted out"" but ""victims will not agree - and neither would I"". The Lib Dem Lord McNally accuses the government of ""capitulating to vested interests"" and says Paul Dacre, the Murdochs and the Barclay brothers ""will be smiling"". Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Keen of Elie is repeating a statement made earlier in the Commons in which Culture Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out conducting part two of the Leveson Inquiry. The inquiry, set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal, was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" since Leveson's 2012 report and the press had cleaned up its act. In January, peers defeated the government to back a proposal that would require Theresa May to proceed with the second stage of the Leveson inquiry when they added it as an amendment to the Data Protection Bill.

Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Kerry McCarthy says there are reports of food rotting because there aren't enough workers to harvest it. While demand for British fruit and vegetables has risen drastically, she says, the ability to source migrant workers has fallen. With food going to waste, she says, one farmer in Kent is even considering moving a substantial amount of his business to Spain. ""Rotting harvests jeopardise the already thin profit margins,"" Ms McCarthy tells MPs. She says migrants workers - generally from Bulgaria and Romania - make up 20 per cent of staff in the agricultural sector. House of CommonsParliament This video can not be played During the business statement a little earlier, SNP MP Alan Brown told the Commons that a case of mistaken identity led to him being threatened with court action over an unpaid London bus fare. The MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said this was the result of an error by a company employed by Transport for London. Replying, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said he raised a serious point but wondered why ""so many people are called Alan Brown"". Facial recognition debate House of LordsParliament Green peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb opens her debate on the use of facial recognition technology in security and policing. She calls it a ""turning point in our civil liberties"" which ""has had barely any acknowledgment"". She says it's an unregulated practice, and calls for police to stop using it and for CCTV images of innocent people to be deleted. Nuclear Safeguards Bill House of LordsParliament Energy Minister Lord Henley responds that there are international obligations to ensure the ONR is independent, and those measures include independent public corporation status and restrictions on ministers' involvement. Lord Hunt is persuaded to withdraw his amendment, and the bill clears committee stage. The bill will pass on to report stage, a chance for peers to seek amendments to the bill before their changes are sent back to the Commons for approval. Nuclear Safeguards Bill House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Hunt of Kings Heath introduces the final amendment on this bill today, which would turn the Office for Nuclear Regulation into a non-ministerial government department. He says after Brexit the ONR will be policing the UK's international commitments and its independent status ""needs to be enhanced"". Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament The St David's Day debate may be cancelled but today's other backbench business debate is still going ahead. It concerns seasonal migrant workers and is opened by Conservative MP Kirstene Hair, who argues that workers are needed in the agricultural sector, which cannot recruit enough UK workers during peak seasons. ""Action has to be taken or we will watch the demise of an industry,"" she warns, with some migrant workers returning ""year after year"". She calls for a visa system allowing EU and non-EU workers to continue to come to the UK. Nuclear Safeguards Bill Euratom regulates the nuclear industry across Europe, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, disposing of waste, and carrying out research. It was set up in 1957 alongside the European Economic Community (EEC), which eventually morphed into the EU. The 1957 treaty established a ""nuclear common market"" to enable the free movement of nuclear workers and materials between member states. The final arrangements between the UK and Euratom after Brexit will have big repercussions for a country which is committed to atomic energy for the long term - unlike Germany, which ditched nuclear power in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Select committee statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign affairs spokesman Fabian Hamilton asks whether budget cuts harmed the ability of the Foreign Office to lobby for representation on the UN court. Ian Murray tells MPs it ""looked as though they were robbing Peter to pay Paul"" by moving staff to lobby in EU member states. Finally, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says the government will make a formal response at a future date. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Maplin collapses as rescue talks failThe 200-store electronics retailer is unable to secure a sale of the business, its boss says.10m11 minutes agoBusiness","One of the UK's biggest electronics retailers has collapsed into administration after talks with buyers failed to secure a sale. Maplin, which has more than 200 stores and 2,300 staff, will continue to trade through the process. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence and a withdrawal of credit insurance. These factors made it ""impossible"" to raise capital, boss Graham Harris said. The news came shortly afterretailer Toys R Us went into administration. ""We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the High Street and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere,"" Mr Harris said. Maplin will now work with administrators PwC ""to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders"", Mr Harris added. PwC said it would ""explore all opportunities to find a new owner"". Stores will open as normal during this time, and there are no plans to close shops or make redundancies at the moment, PwC said. Any outstanding customer orders will be delivered, while gift cards will continue to be accepted in stores for the present, it added. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ""The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. ""Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened,"" he said. ""Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration."" Maplin has 2,335 staff, 217 stores and an annual turnover of Â£235.8m. It operates in the UK and Ireland and has head offices in London and Rotherham. It began as a mail-order business in 1972, providing electronic components to hobbyists. Maplin opened its first shop in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex in 1976. After changing hands several times, the chain has been owned by Rutland Partners since 2014. Potential buyers had included Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the clothing company that owns Peacocks, Country Casuals and several other retailers. However, talks are understood to have broken down. High Street chains have been badly affected by lower consumer spending, higher inflation and competition from online rivals.

Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk',"Most cannabis being sold illegally in the UK is super-strength skunk linked to ahigher risk of psychotic mental health episodes, an analysis of 995 samples seized by the police suggests. In 2016, 94% of police seizures were high-potency marijuana, compared to 85% in 2008 and 51% in 2005. The drug contains more of the psychoactive ingredient THC than some other types of cannabis, such as hash. Researchers from King's College London say users should be warned of this. There are three main types of street cannabis - hash (hashish or resin), herbal cannabis (weed, grass or marijuana) and high-potency cannabis or skunk. Hash is made from the resin of the plant, while herbal cannabis is made from the dried leaves and flowering parts of pollinated cannabis plants. Skunk is made from from unpollinated cannabis plants which naturally contain higher levels of THC - the substance that gives recreational users the 'stoned' feelings they seek from the drug, but can also cause nasty side effects, including paranoia and hallucinations. Hash and herbal cannabis are considered to be milder than skunk. That's because they contain higher levels of a substance called CBD (cannabidiol) which experts say works as an anti-psychotic and counteracts some of the negative effects of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). It's argued that cannabis with high levels of THC and no or very low CBD can lead to people developing psychiatric issues. The skunk examined by the researchers from King's College London was high potency - about 14% THC. High-potency skunk Previous work by the same team, based ona study of 780 people,external, suggests the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of potent ""skunk-like"" cannabis than for non-users. The use of hash, a milder form of the drug, was not associated with increased risk of psychosis. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, there is sufficient evidence to show that people who use cannabis, particularly at a younger age, such as around the age of 15, have a higher than average risk of developing a psychotic illness, including schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The researchers say their latest work, published in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis, is the first comprehensive survey of cannabis strength published in the UK for nearly a decade. They analysed police seizures of cannabis from London, Kent, Derbyshire, Merseyside and Sussex in 2005, 2008 and again in 2016. Skunk was the dominant street drug over this time period, while the availability of weaker cannabis resin went down - from 43% in 2005 and 14% in 2008, to 6% in 2016. THC levels in skunk remained fairly constant over the decade. Cannabis is a Class B drug - it's illegal to possess, give away or sell. Possession is illegal whatever you're using it for, including pain relief. The penalty for possession is up to five years in prison. Supplying can get you up to 14 years and an unlimited fine. Giving it to friends, even if they don't pay, is considered as supplying. According to Home Office statistics, cannabis was the most commonly used drug in 2016/17, with 6.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 having used it in the last year. That's around 2.2 million people. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. Alfie Dingley and his mum Hannah Deacon MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Cannabis oil is a type of medical cannabis that has made the headlines most recently in the UK because of the case ofAlfie Dingley, a young boy with severe epilepsy who can suffer up to 30 violent seizures a day. His mother, Hannah Deacon, has been fighting for the courts to allow her son, who is six, to get the treatment in Britain.

May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft,"This video can not be played May: I'll make opposition to plans 'crystal clear' to EU An EU proposal for the Northern Ireland border threatens the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom, Theresa May has said. The EU'sdraft legal agreement,externalproposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May said ""no UK prime minister could ever agree"" to this. The EU says the ""backstop"" option is not intended to ""provoke"" the UK. Unveiling the draft agreement on what has proved to be a busy day for Brexit news, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier called on the UK to come up with alternatives. He said the text was ""no surprise"" and was just a legally-worded assessment of what had been agreed in the negotiations so far. Real crisis or par for the course? Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Reality Check guide to the key bits of the EU draft Johnson says NI border row being exploited UK's transition offer to EU nationals The EU's 120-page paper covers the issues which have been negotiated so far - including the UK's financial settlement, citizens' rights and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is a member of the EU - after Brexit. On how to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland, the EU says a ""backstop"" is needed in case neither of the UK's preferred solutions can be found. This video can not be played Michel Barnier: I'm not trying to provoke anyone This would involve an ""area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods is ensured"", covering customs, VAT, energy, agriculture, goods and other sectors, across the island of Ireland. ""The territory of Northern Ireland... shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union,"" the document says. Other options - a UK-EU deal that means checks are not needed and technological solutions for a ""virtual"" border - will also be explored. Mr Barnier said the document contained ""concrete and realistic solutions"". The idea of separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland has provoked an angry reaction from the Democratic Unionist Party and some Conservative MPs who say it would effectively create a new border in the Irish Sea. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she would be making her opposition to it ""crystal clear"" to the EU commission. ""The draft legal text the commission have published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minster could ever agree to it,"" she said. This video can not be played Will the bridge that unites the two villages be used to divide them? The prime minister was responding to a question from David Simpson of the DUP, the party that gives the government the Commons support it needs to win key votes in the House of Commons. Earlier the DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his reaction to the publication was one of ""amazement"" that the EU thought it ""could possibly fly with either us or the British government"". ""We did not leave the European Union to oversee the breakup of the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC, adding that it would be ""catastrophic"" for Northern Ireland to be ""cut off"" from UK markets. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested the row over the border was being used to keep the UK inside the customs union. But Labour said the EU-UK government ""war of words"" needs to end. ""Theresa May's failure to offer any viable solution to the border in Northern Ireland has come back to haunt her,"" said shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Kier Starmer. In December both sides came up with an agreement that Downing Street hailed as a ""breakthrough"" and meant the EU agreed to move talks on to the next phase. It included a promise to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But the EU says that the next phase of negotiations - which includes drawing up a post-Brexit transition and opening trade talks on permanent post-Brexit relations - can only progress if December's agreement is ""translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible"". And doing this has reopened the debate about the Northern Ireland border. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Downing Street said that overall the negotiations were ""progressing well"", adding that ""it would be surprising at this point if we did agree on everything"". The Irish government said the publication was ""another important step in the Brexit negotiations"". Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said the ""backstop"" option was ""very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary"". Labour says it would solve the Irish border question by entering into a new customs union with the EU, meaning checks are not needed as people and goods pass between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Brexit: All you need to know Kuenssberg: Major's warning for May As well as the Irish border, another area of contention is the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The UK has said it will leave the ECJ's jurisdiction and regain control of its laws after Brexit. According to the EU's draft document, disputes over the Brexit agreement in future years would be settled by a ""joint committee"" made up of representatives from both sides. But the EU proposes that this committee would be able to refer to the European Court of Justice for a binding ruling - with the EU's court having the power to levy a fine or suspend parts of the Brexit treaty. The EU is also insisting that EU citizens who arrive in Britain during the transition period have the same right to stay in the country as those who arrived before Brexit - the UK has said these people should be treated differently as their ""expectations"" will be different. In a newpolicy paper,external, the UK said people arriving during transition would be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK - with their rights subject to UK law. Mr Barnier stressed that the document was a draft and would now be circulated among the 27 other EU nations and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group for revision and agreement before being placed on the negotiating table. UK negotiators will work with the EU to see how December's commitments can be translated into legal form, Theresa May said. Attention will then soon turn to Friday, when the prime minister is to make a speech setting out the UK's strategy for the next phase of negotiations. Key to this will be how closely the UK seeks to stay to EU rules in order to maintain a close trading relationship. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has, meanwhile, said Conservative MPs must vote with their ""own conscience"" on whether to accept the final deal reached between the UK and the EU. In a speech in London, he said they could decide on a new referendum. Sir John said ""both democracy and prudence"" suggest that parties should not dictate to their MPs how to vote. ""Brexit is a unique decision,"" he added. ""It will affect the lives of the British nation for generations to come. If it flops - there will be the most terrible backlash. But Eurosceptic MPs were not impressed with his suggestion. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - who rebelled on EU votes during Sir John's time in Downing Street - told the BBC: ""He was not a prime minister who was too keen on free votes when he was there."" Backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Sir John had been wrong on Europe in the past ""and he is getting it wrong again"".

The inquiry was set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal and ""part two"" of the inquiry was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" and the press had cleaned up its act. Labour shadow culture secretary Tom Watson condemned the decision, calling it a ""bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion"". Labour MP Chris Bryant was a victim of phone hacking and is in contact with other victims, including the family of Millie Dowler. He says many of the victims will feel that the culture secretary has ""shoved another little knife in our hearts"". House of CommonsParliament There's an early end for Commons today, to enable MPs and staff to attempt to get home through the snow. The House will next sit at 2:30pm on Monday, to put questions to defence ministers and to debate the Data Protection Bill. Future of ATMs House of CommonsParliament Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick winds up the debate, and the day's business. Mr Jenrick says the Treasury will be following this issue ""very closely in the months and and years"" to come and says the use of coinage and notes is in decline as a result of digitisation. Mr Jenrick says the government will ""protect the vulnerable"" and ensure the benefits of technology ""work for all"" in the UK. He adds that ""there are more ATMs in the UK than ever before, around 54,000 of which are free to use"", forming one of the largest networks in the world. Future of ATMs House of CommonsParliament Conservative Simon Hoare is finishing off the week with a short debate on the future of ATMs. The ATM Industry Association has warned  that thousands of free-to-use ATMs may close after cuts to fees for operators. Consumer group Which? say 200 communities in Britain already have poor ATM provision, or no cash machines at all. Mr Hoare says banks are ""very much the heart"" of rural communities and warns of the ""death of cash"".  Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Immigration minister Caroline Nokes rises to conclude the debate. She jokes that she wishes she'd had lunch first, given the wide variety of produce that has been discussed. Ms Nokes says we want to see a ""more dynamic and self-reliant"" agricultural industry as the UK continues to compete internationally, ""supplying products of the highest quality and increasing our exports"". She assures MPs that the seasonal agricultural workers scheme is ""under constant review"", referring tocomments made last weekby the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords adjourns, and will return at 2.30pm on Monday. Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Shadow home office minister Afzal Khan says there ""appears to be a consensus"" that the government needs to take some urgent action. Mr Khan says there are ""strong and compelling"" arguments for the revival of a seasonal agricultural workers scheme, which Labour would support. ""Businesses need to be able to plan for next season"", he says. Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP John Lamont emphasises the importance of seasonal workers to farming on the Scottish borders. The MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says the struggle to recruit seasonal agricultural workers is ""notably due to the drop in the pound"". Mr Lamont says the numbers of people coming from the European Union to work seasonally has been falling ""long before the EU referendum was announced"". He calls on the UK government to look closely at re-introducing the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. The scheme, allowing thousands of East European migrants to work on British farms, was closed in 2013 when labour market curbs for workers from Romania and Bulgaria were lifted. Read more about it here.  Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Keen assures peers that Sir Brian Leveson's response to the inquiry's closure will be made available for them to read. He rejects the claim that the decision amounts to a ""political deal"", saying it's a matter of ""political judgement"". He acknowledges the right of peers to return to the matter. Crossbencher Baroness Hollins, who tabled the amendment laying the groundwork for Leveson two on which the government was defeated, says she ""looks forward"" to peers returning to the Data Protection Bill. Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Shadow culture spokesman Lord Stevenson of Balmacara points out that Sir Brian Leveson believes the inquiry should continue in an amended form, arguing that without this we won't know the extent of alleged corruption between police, politicians and the media. He says the government believes it's ""sorted out"" but ""victims will not agree - and neither would I"". The Lib Dem Lord McNally accuses the government of ""capitulating to vested interests"" and says Paul Dacre, the Murdochs and the Barclay brothers ""will be smiling"". Leveson Inquiry statement House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Keen of Elie is repeating a statement made earlier in the Commons in which Culture Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out conducting part two of the Leveson Inquiry. The inquiry, set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal, was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" since Leveson's 2012 report and the press had cleaned up its act. In January, peers defeated the government to back a proposal that would require Theresa May to proceed with the second stage of the Leveson inquiry when they added it as an amendment to the Data Protection Bill.

Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Kerry McCarthy says there are reports of food rotting because there aren't enough workers to harvest it. While demand for British fruit and vegetables has risen drastically, she says, the ability to source migrant workers has fallen. With food going to waste, she says, one farmer in Kent is even considering moving a substantial amount of his business to Spain. ""Rotting harvests jeopardise the already thin profit margins,"" Ms McCarthy tells MPs. She says migrants workers - generally from Bulgaria and Romania - make up 20 per cent of staff in the agricultural sector. House of CommonsParliament This video can not be played During the business statement a little earlier, SNP MP Alan Brown told the Commons that a case of mistaken identity led to him being threatened with court action over an unpaid London bus fare. The MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said this was the result of an error by a company employed by Transport for London. Replying, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said he raised a serious point but wondered why ""so many people are called Alan Brown"". Facial recognition debate House of LordsParliament Green peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb opens her debate on the use of facial recognition technology in security and policing. She calls it a ""turning point in our civil liberties"" which ""has had barely any acknowledgment"". She says it's an unregulated practice, and calls for police to stop using it and for CCTV images of innocent people to be deleted. Nuclear Safeguards Bill House of LordsParliament Energy Minister Lord Henley responds that there are international obligations to ensure the ONR is independent, and those measures include independent public corporation status and restrictions on ministers' involvement. Lord Hunt is persuaded to withdraw his amendment, and the bill clears committee stage. The bill will pass on to report stage, a chance for peers to seek amendments to the bill before their changes are sent back to the Commons for approval. Nuclear Safeguards Bill House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Hunt of Kings Heath introduces the final amendment on this bill today, which would turn the Office for Nuclear Regulation into a non-ministerial government department. He says after Brexit the ONR will be policing the UK's international commitments and its independent status ""needs to be enhanced"". Seasonal migrant workers House of CommonsParliament The St David's Day debate may be cancelled but today's other backbench business debate is still going ahead. It concerns seasonal migrant workers and is opened by Conservative MP Kirstene Hair, who argues that workers are needed in the agricultural sector, which cannot recruit enough UK workers during peak seasons. ""Action has to be taken or we will watch the demise of an industry,"" she warns, with some migrant workers returning ""year after year"". She calls for a visa system allowing EU and non-EU workers to continue to come to the UK. Nuclear Safeguards Bill Euratom regulates the nuclear industry across Europe, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, disposing of waste, and carrying out research. It was set up in 1957 alongside the European Economic Community (EEC), which eventually morphed into the EU. The 1957 treaty established a ""nuclear common market"" to enable the free movement of nuclear workers and materials between member states. The final arrangements between the UK and Euratom after Brexit will have big repercussions for a country which is committed to atomic energy for the long term - unlike Germany, which ditched nuclear power in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Select committee statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign affairs spokesman Fabian Hamilton asks whether budget cuts harmed the ability of the Foreign Office to lobby for representation on the UN court. Ian Murray tells MPs it ""looked as though they were robbing Peter to pay Paul"" by moving staff to lobby in EU member states. Finally, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says the government will make a formal response at a future date. Â© 2025 BBC.

BBC charity sacked staff for sex harassmentInternational development charity BBC Media Action reveals six people were dismissed over 10 years.7h7 hours agoWorld,"A BBC charity says it has sacked six people for sexual harassment or for watching pornography on work computers. BBC Media Action said the incidents happened overseas in the past 10 years and those sacked were all foreign nationals. The international development charity has received Â£70m over the past five years from the UK's Department for International Development (DfID). The government agency said it had no record of the sexual misconduct. It comes as international charities face closer scrutiny following claims of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff in Haiti. DfID has asked all UK charities working overseas to provide assurances about their safeguarding and disciplinary policies and procedures. BBC Media Action said it had responded, giving those assurances. ""We have reviewed all cases in the last 10 years involving or potentially involving sexual misconduct. Six such cases have been identified over this period, all of which were investigated,"" a statement said. ""In two of these, no grounds were found to take any disciplinary action. ""In the remaining four, formal disciplinary action was taken. None involved beneficiaries and we are not aware of any child protection issues. A total of six people were dismissed for sexual harassment or for watching pornography on work computers."" How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Thousands cancel donations to charity How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? The charity said it would continue to examine policies and processes around safeguarding and whistleblowing ""and take action to strengthen them further wherever necessary"". It added: ""We want to foster a culture where everyone working at BBC Media Action can recognise abuse, knows what they can do to help prevent it, and where anyone with an allegation is heard."" BBC Media Action is an independent charity that is not funded by the BBC licence fee. It trains journalists and produces programmes in countries across the world. A DfID spokesman said: ""DfID does not have a record of any sexual misconduct allegations relating to BBC Media Action on our Counter Fraud and Whistleblowing system.""

Why is my train cancelled?,"As the so-called beast from the east headed for the UK, hundreds of train services were cancelled in anticipation. But was it really necessary? On Monday, a number of private train operators, including South Eastern, Greater Anglia, Southern, c2c, Greater Northern and TFL Rail announced reduced timetables ahead of the forecast snow and freezing conditions. But not all commuters were convinced the cancellations were required. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Normal services have been cut to allow engineers to focus on keeping the main parts of the rail network open. Compacted snow can turn into solid ice and prevent points - which direct trains from one track to another - from working, according to Network Rail. One train operator, Greater Anglia, said its limited service was to allow track engineers to deploy ""snow ploughs, points heaters and snow clearing teams"". Live updates: Snow causes disruption Travel warning as snow sweeps across Scotland How cold is it where you are? But it's not just snow that causes problems. Frozen rails can stick together, causing signals to stay red and stop trains. The UK's systems - especially in rural areas - are not designed for the extreme temperatures we're seeing this week, Tony Miles from Modern Railway magazine explained. Engineers would need to be sent to de-ice problem areas, he said. ""Network Rail go on advice from the Met Office,"" Mr Miles added. ""It's better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver."" But Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said blanket suspensions are ""worrying"". ""The industry needs to better communicate why such drastic action is necessary,"" he added. Network Rail has since admitted snow was not as bad as anticipated in Anglia and said it was working to restore a full service by Wednesday. A report in the Daily Telegraph has suggested therecould be a financial incentive for private train operators,external, who get paid compensation from Network Rail for cancellations and delays to services caused by bad weather or engineering work. It reports that between 2011 and 2017 rail companies were handed more than Â£2bn in compensation by Network Rail. Over the same period passengers received Â£187m in compensation from rail operators. But the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), a pan-industry body, said the payments were overseen by the rail regulator and were ""completely separate from the money customers rightly receive for delays"". Network Rail provides the infrastructure upon which services run. If it fails in its obligations, train companies are paid to cover the revenue lost, the BBC's transport correspondent Victoria Fritz explained. ""On the other side of the relationship, train operators must pay the track operator for the privilege of using the network. ""Track charges make up 25% of Network Rail's revenue."" ""No train company wants to lose fare revenue,"" Fritz added. ""Their forecasts are based on passenger growth and revenue growth. ""So it's not exactly fair to say that train companies rub their hands in glee when it gets a bit nippy."" A train crosses the viaduct in Denby Dale, west Yorkshire Passengers received Â£74m in compensation last year, five times more than five years earlier, according to the RDG. But the process is not always straightforward. If your pre-booked train is cancelled or delayed and you choose not to travel, you are entitled to a refund on most ticket types. Once an emergency timetable with reduced services has been put into action, passengers who buy on-the-day tickets are unable to claim compensation for a cancelled train as the train operators have given notice. However you can claim against the revised timetable. So if the trains that are advertised to run are delayed by more than 30 minutes, you can still make a claim to the individual train operator under the delay repay scheme. This process differs depending on the type of ticket you're travelling on and with whom. But the offer of a refund is unlikely to please everyone... Allow Twitter content?

Row over 'racist' Mosley election leaflet,"Privacy campaigner Max Mosley published a by-election leaflet saying: ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health,"" it has been claimed. The 1961 leaflet, backing a candidate for his father Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, wasfound by the Daily Mail in archives in Manchester,external. The newspaper says it raises questions over Mr Mosley's evidence to a 2008 High Court trial. Mr Mosley said he didn't recall the leaflet and he was not a racist. In evidence to the 2008 trial, in which he successfully sued the News of the World over reports about a sado-masochistic sex session he had had with five prostitutes, Mr Mosley denied any knowledge of the leaflet. He said he had challenged lawyers for the the now-defunct Sunday tabloid to produce the document in court, ""which they failed to do"". ""I obviously would not have done that if I knew of its existence,"" he told the Press Association. ""My record in motor-sport demonstrates that I do not tolerate racism and, like most people, my political views have changed over time."" The former Formula 1 boss was presented with a photocopy of the leaflet, for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 Moss Side by-election,during an interview with Channel 4 News,external.

The leaflet, which says it was ""published by Max Mosley"", includes the warning: ""Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD [venereal (sexually transmitted) disease] and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" It also states that ""if enough people vote for me in this election, the government... will be sending coloured immigrants home, instead of bringing more in"" and urges voters to ""let us give the coloured people a fair deal by sending them back to good jobs and good wages at home in Jamaica"". Asked about the line ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health,"" Mr Mosley said: ""I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely."" But he said he had ""no reason to apologise to anyone"", adding: ""This was a statement in a leaflet which I am not even sure is genuine, which would never reflect my view, it would not reflect my view then or now because I simply wouldn't dream of insulting people."" He told Channel 4 News: ""If that leaflet is genuine, I am responsible for it and it shouldn't have been issued"". Tom Watson's office has been funded by Max Mosley But he said: ""I have never been a racist. I am not a racist, never will be a racist."" He was also quizzed about whether he was a ""fit and proper person"" to be funding the office of Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, which has received Â£500,000 from Mr Mosley. ""Why should I not support Tom Watson, who is probably one of the most honest and courageous politicians we have got?"" he said. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Mr Watson said: ""My views on press regulation are well known and have not changed. ""The views expressed by Max as a young man are not the views he holds now, just as the Rothermere family [owners of Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Daily Mail] no longer uses its newspapers to support fascism."" Mr Mosley has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the News of the World wrongly reported his sado-masochistic sex session had been ""Nazi-themed"", and has donated funds to press regulator Impress. He is also attempting to use data protection laws to delete references to what he calls this ""private party"" and what he says are inaccurate references about his relationship to Impress. He told the Press Association he would ""continue to campaign for the vital reforms needed to protect ordinary people against the bullying of newspapers like the Daily Mail"".

N Korea 'helping Syria chemical weapons',"There have been recent reports of chlorine gas attacks in the eastern Ghouta region North Korea has been sending equipment to Syria that could be used to make chemical weapons, a UN report says. Some 40 previously unreported shipments were made between 2012 and 2017, the report found. Materials included acid-resistant tiles, valves and pipes. The leaked report says North Korean missile specialists have been seen at Syrian weapon-making centres. The allegations follow new reports of chlorine being used by Syrian forces, which the government denies. Meanwhile, for a second day, a ""pause"" in fighting has failed to hold in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus. The daily five-hour pause was meant to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave the rebel-held area through a humanitarian corridor. But as with Tuesday, the truce was marred by violence.Activists reported hearing missile strikes and barrel bombs, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused ""militants"" of blocking access to the humanitarian corridor. What are the allegations against North Korea? North Korea is under international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Is North Korea just playing the US? But a confidential report, compiled by a UN Panel of Experts which assesses North Korea's compliance with UN resolutions, found evidence of illicit supplies sent to Syria. The report, which has been seen by the BBC, details the ""innovative evasion techniques"" used by North Korea to send items such as high-heat, acid-resistant tiles, corrosion-resistant valves and thermometers. The Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) - a Syrian government agency - is alleged to have paid North Korea for the equipment via a number of front companies. The SSRC is promoted by the Syrian government as a civilian research institute buta Western intelligence agency told the BBC last year that chemical weapons were being manufactured at three SSRC sites- Masyaf, in Hama province, and at Dummar and Barzeh, both just outside Damascus. Barzeh was named in the UN report as one of the chemical weapons and missile facilities North Korean technicians had been seen operating at. The Syrian government told the UN panel that the only North Koreans present in Syria were sports coaches and athletes. Among the alleged shipments from North Korea to Syria, at least five were sent via a Chinese trading firm, Cheng Tong Trading Co Ltd, the UN report says. The shipments allegedly contained acid-resistant tiles - which can be used for activities conducted at high temperatures - of a quantity that would cover the area of a large scale industrial project. While the seized items ""do not appear on any control lists"", they included ""materials that can be used to build bricks for the interior walls of [a] chemical factory"", the report noted. North Korea flouting sanctions, UN told China responded to the UN panel's findings, saying it had no ""evidence demonstrating the Cheng Tong Trading Co has business with"" any North Korean entities in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. UN spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric did not say whether the leaked report would be published, but told the New York Times: ""I think the overarching message is that all member states have a duty and responsibility to abide by the sanctions that are in place."" The UN Panel issued a report last September,external, which said it was ""investigating reported prohibited chemical, ballistic missile and conventional arms co-operation"" between Syria and North Korea. Syria signed up to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to have its declared chemical weapons stock destroyed in 2013 aftera Sarin nerve agent attack killed hundreds of people in rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. It has been accused of repeatedly using banned chemical weapons in the civil war since then. Q&A: Syria chemical weapons disarmament deal The spectre of nerve agents in Syria - again The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that Sarin was used in Khan Sheikhoun, a rebel-held town in Idlib province, last April in an incident that killed more than 80 people. OPCW and UN investigators are confident the Syrian air force was to blame. Suspected chlorine attacks have been recently reported in Syria, including on Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta. Experts say North Korea has long offered military supplies and weapons know-how around the world in exchange for cash. The UN report also highlights its efforts to illicitly trade with dozens of countries and groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America. US to impose 'largest' N Korea sanctions Reality Check: How North Korea does business Syria and North Korea have decades-old military ties. Last week, US President Donald Trump said Washington was imposing a fresh set of sanctions on North Korea, targeting more than 50 ships and maritime transport companies in several countries. This video can not be played 'Chance of N Korea war highest in decades' says ex-US general North Korea is already under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. Viewpoint: Chemical weapons âthreat to Westâ North Korea crisis in 300 words But it continued tests last year, including tests of a nuclear weapon and a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. The US says the new sanctions are designed to put a further squeeze on North Korea, cutting off sources of revenue and fuel for its nuclear programme and clamping down on evasion of already existing restrictions.

Johnson says NI border row being exploited,"The draft withdrawal treaty will set out the options for supporting cross-border trade and traffic Boris Johnson has said the row over the border in Northern Ireland is being used to frustrate Brexit. The foreign secretary insisted there were ""very good solutions"" to avoid the need for a hard border. There is a stand-off on the issue with the EU publishing alegal draft,externalof its Brexit withdrawal agreement. An option for Northern Ireland to follow EU rules to avoid a ""hard border"" - if an alternative arrangement is not agreed - has sparked a row. The Democratic Unionist Party, which offers vital support in key votes to the Tory government, says details of the draft treaty have ""fundamentally breached"" an agreement reached in Brussels late last year. Conservative Brexiteers say it is ""completely unacceptable"" and would effectively annex Northern Ireland. The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, unveiling the draft agreement, described this Northern Ireland border option as a ""backstop"" if no other proposals are found. And a former EU commissioner said it was down to the UK to come up with a solution, warning that ""at a high pace we are heading to the cliff edge"". BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was shaping up to become ""the big Brexit bust-up"" with both sides of the argument refusing to budge. How to read the draft Brexit treaty Why English courts are opening in the EU Brexit: All you need to know Mr Johnson faced criticisism on Tuesday for suggesting in a BBC interview the issue of the border could be managed as easily as London's congestion charging zone. Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, he said: ""What is going on at the moment is that the issue of the Northern Irish border is being used quite a lot politically to try and keep the UK in the customs union - effectively the single market - so we cannot really leave the EU. That is what is going on."" This video can not be played Will the bridge that unites the two villages be used to divide them? ""If the EU or Dublin believes the UK government will be signing up to a border in the Irish Sea, they are deluded,"" said senior DUP member Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr Donaldson argued the draft divorce treaty would also undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in the Belfast Agreement. Boris Johnson spoke to reporters after braving the snow for a jog That 1998 treaty - also known as the Good Friday Agreement - between the British and Irish governments and most political parties in Northern Ireland decided how the region would be governed and brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict. Former Brexit minister David Jones told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the EU was proposing that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union, and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""That effectively amounts to an annexure of Northern Ireland by the European Union,"" he said, adding: ""I think that it would be pretty catastrophic and I think that the European Union in actually proposing this is behaving wholly irresponsibly."" This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) But former EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said: ""If you have another solution then please come up with it."" All of the UK's proposals so far have been ""mutually incompatible"", he added. And Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE that in order to avoid the backstop being triggered,  ""it is up to the UK to bring proposals to the table to make that possible"". He added: ""It's not OK for people, whether pro-Brexit politicians in Britain, people or parties in Northern Ireland, to just say 'no' now."" Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition Boris Johnson: Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Fox warning of customs union 'sellout' The draft document aims to encapsulate - in legally binding language - agreements already reached on Ireland, citizens' rights and the UK's so-called ""divorce bill"". It mandates that during the Brexit transition, which it says should last only until the end of 2020, the UK must continue to comply with all existing EU legislation. It would however lose all voting rights and decision-making power, including on any rules adopted by the 27 remaining member states. EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the document will not contain any surprises because it translates the political pledges made by both sides in the talks so far. ""The clock is ticking; time is short,"" Mr Barnier said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""I am concerned."" Theresa May wants trade to be frictionless across the Irish border after Brexit. But there is plenty of political friction as every potential solution seems to bring a new problem. In a leaked letter designed to demonstrate that there would be no need for new infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Boris Johnson used a potentially toxic phrase: ""even IF there is a hard border"". This allowed critics to suggest that a regime of border checks which would be anathema to republicans, nationalists and the Irish government was being contemplated. Downing Street swiftly reiterated its commitment to no hard border. But one of the solutions - indeed, the most detailed option - being put forward by the EU would keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU regulations. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson has said the government cannot sign up to what would in effect be a border in the Irish Sea. And with rebellions threatened by some of her own backbenchers, Mrs May is likely to need the DUP's MPs to deliver the Brexit she's promising. The prime minister's office has categorically dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit. The statement on Tuesday evening followed the leak of a letter to the prime minister from Mr Johnson, in which he appeared to contemplate the possibility of future customs border checks, after the UK, including Northern Ireland leaves the EU customs union. The leaked letter, obtained by Sky News, quoted Mr Johnson telling the prime minister the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland would continue to leave 95% of traffic to pass unchecked. Following the letter's emergence, Labour called for Mr Johnson - one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet - to be dismissed ""before he can do any more damage"". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said the letter was ""designed to outline how a highly facilitated border would work and help to make a successful Brexit"". ""It shows how we could manage a border without infrastructure or related checks and controls while protecting UK, Northern Ireland, Irish and EU interests.""

"'Bucket list' killer jailed for 28 yearsBriton Jemma Lilley garrotted, stabbed and buried Aaron Pajich at her home in Australia.6h6 hours agoLincolnshire","Police said Jemma Lilley, pictured, had tarpaulins at her house where Aaron Pajich was killed A woman who had an ""obsession"" with serial killers and had murder on her ""bucket list"" has been jailed for killing a teenager. Jemma Lilley, previously of Stamford, Lincolnshire, garrotted, stabbed and buried Aaron Pajich at her home in Perth, Australia. The 26-year-old was convicted alongside housemate Trudi Lenon at the Supreme Court of Western Australia in November. The pair have been sentenced to life with a minimum jail term of 28 years. During a four-week trial, prosecutor James McTaggart told the court Lilley was so ""full of herself and euphoric"" after the killing she could not help boasting to a work colleague. How ""euphoric"" killers' murder plot was hatched Jurors were told Lilley, who had a troubled childhood, had emigrated to Australia in 2010. She developed what prosecutors described as a long-term fascination with horror films, murder and serial killers. Lilley idolised horror film character Freddy Krueger, and had previously told a friend she wanted to kill before she turned 25. The supermarket shelf-stacker had also penned a book about a serial killer named SOS - a nickname she used during online exchanges with accomplice Lenon. Aaron Pajich's mother Sharon Pajich said he was 'my precious little boy, full of life' The pair met through a friend and became close, eventually moving in together about two months before the killing. Both women exchanged homicidal fantasies which gradually intensified until they lured Mr Pajich to his death. In the weeks before, they bought various supplies, including a circular saw and 100 litres of hydrochloric acid. Lilley's stepmother Nina said she had ""always had an obsession with serial killers"" but this had been ""a way of venting her frustration of what happened when she was a child"". Speaking to The Times after the conviction, Ms Lilley, 48, said: ""The book was a big problem with me. At the beginning I was 'fair enough you want to write a horror story', but I didn't like the contents of it."" Mr Pajich was lured to his death on 13 June 2016 and buried in a shallow grave covered with concrete and tiles, with both defendants blaming each other for the killing. Lenon, 43, told the court Lilley approached the teenager from behind as he installed games on her computer, garroted him until the wire broke then stabbed him three times. Aaron's mother Sharon Pajich said Lilley and Lenon were ""disgusting animals"" who should never be released. The pair were sentenced on Wednesday.

"Slovak PM offers â¬1m over slain journalistPosing next to stacks of cash, Robert Fico asked for information about the murder of Jan Kuciak.2h2 hours agoEurope","The PM also hit out at opposition groups for the ""political abuse of a tragedy"" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has offered a one million euro ($1.2m) reward for anyone who comes forward with information about the murder of an investigative journalist. Jan Kuciak, 27, and his partner Martina Kusnirova were shot dead in their home. Both were found with single gunshot wounds on Sunday. Several newspapers in Slovakia have printed Kuciak's last article, which links the Italian mafia to high-level political corruption. Mr Fico held a press conference on Tuesday, where he stood by piles of banknotes that the government is promising in exchange for information about the killings. Slovakia shocked by journalist's shooting Press speculation about the motive for the mysterious murders has been rife in Slovakia. Kuciak's colleagues in the media say that authorities should look no further than his latest piece, published by Slovak outlets overnight. In the unfinished article, he alleges that businessmen in eastern Slovakia - with links to Calabria's notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia - are embezzling EU structural funds. He also claims that they have political ties in the country. Both Kuciak and his girlfriend were discovered with single fatal gunshot wounds, police say According to earlier media reports, Maria Toroskova, a senior advisor to PM Fico, was among those being probed. ""Do not link innocent people without any evidence to a double homicide,"" Mr Fico told journalists on Tuesday. ""It's crossing the line. It's no longer funny."" During the Tuesday press conference Mr Fico complained about ""political abuse of a tragedy"" after opposition politicians held a news conference making accusations linking the ruling Smer party to the killings. Opposition groups have called for fresh anti-corruption protests in the capital Bratislava on Wednesday. Police President Tibor Gaspar said authorities had questioned 20 people since Monday, and had contacted the Czech Republic and Italy about the investigation. Mr Gaspar also confirmed the EU's police agency Europol had offered their specialist assistance with the investigation. The chief has said the motive was ""most likely"" related to Kuciak's investigative journalism, and has warned reporters about publishing details of the case. ""How can we do our work effectively if you are alerting some people who may be involved?"" he said. The killing of the couple has triggered calls for fresh anti-corruption demonstrations Like other ex-communist countries, Slovakia enacted far-reaching law and justice reforms in order to qualify for EU membership. Kuciak had been working for Aktuality.sk, an online unit of Swiss and German-owned publisher Ringier Axel Springer, for three years. He, like fellowmurdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, worked on the Panama Papers scandal. The Slovak Prime Minister has said he would meet media outlets to assure them ""that the protection of freedom of speech and the safety of journalists is our common priority and that it is extremely important to my government"".

BBC charity sacked staff for sex harassment,"A BBC charity says it has sacked six people for sexual harassment or for watching pornography on work computers. BBC Media Action said the incidents happened overseas in the past 10 years and those sacked were all foreign nationals. The international development charity has received Â£70m over the past five years from the UK's Department for International Development (DfID). The government agency said it had no record of the sexual misconduct. It comes as international charities face closer scrutiny following claims of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff in Haiti. DfID has asked all UK charities working overseas to provide assurances about their safeguarding and disciplinary policies and procedures. BBC Media Action said it had responded, giving those assurances. ""We have reviewed all cases in the last 10 years involving or potentially involving sexual misconduct. Six such cases have been identified over this period, all of which were investigated,"" a statement said. ""In two of these, no grounds were found to take any disciplinary action. ""In the remaining four, formal disciplinary action was taken. None involved beneficiaries and we are not aware of any child protection issues. A total of six people were dismissed for sexual harassment or for watching pornography on work computers."" How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Thousands cancel donations to charity How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? The charity said it would continue to examine policies and processes around safeguarding and whistleblowing ""and take action to strengthen them further wherever necessary"". It added: ""We want to foster a culture where everyone working at BBC Media Action can recognise abuse, knows what they can do to help prevent it, and where anyone with an allegation is heard."" BBC Media Action is an independent charity that is not funded by the BBC licence fee. It trains journalists and produces programmes in countries across the world.

Man fell 130ft at 'lethal' Qatar stadium,"Zachary Cox fell 130ft while working at the Khalifa International Stadium A construction worker was killed in a fall at a Qatar 2022 World Cup stadium building site while using ""potentially lethal equipment"", an inquest heard. Zachary Cox, 40, plummeted 130ft (40m) at Khalifa International Stadium in Doha on 19 January last year. He sustained brain injuries and a broken neck in the fall, Brighton and Hove Coroner's Court heard. Work practices at the stadium were ""inherently unsafe"", the coroner said. His family has called for an independent inquiry into his death. Mr Cox, who was born in Johannesburg but later lived in Hove and London, fell when a faulty hoist he was using to put a suspended walkway in place broke. His safety harness also snapped under the weight and he dropped head first. He was pronounced dead in hospital. Coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley found he died from multiple injuries after a fall from height after new work practices, which she branded ""inherently unsafe"", were introduced. Zachary Cox was employed by a South African subcontractor, which was working for a German firm The inquest heard extra hoists were brought in to speed up the construction after problems with some of the 1.8 tonne metal platforms had to be fixed, putting the project behind schedule. Recording a narrative conclusion, the coroner said: ""The site managers at the stadium knew or should have known that they were effectively requiring a group of their workers to rely on potentially lethal equipment. ""[The new system] was chaotic, unprofessional, unthinking and downright dangerous."" After the inquest, Mr Cox's sisters-in-law Ella Joseph and Hazel Mayes called for an independent inquiry and for the Foreign Office to step in. ""We demand reassurance that those responsible for making the decisions that ultimately led to Zac's death will be held to account and justice will be served,"" they said. ""We want to know lessons will be learnt, so other families won't suffer under similar circumstances."" Mr Cox was employed by a South African subcontractor, which was working for a German firm.

Satisfaction with GP services slumps,"This video can not be played Government must give more money to healthcare, says professor Public satisfaction with GP services has fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1983, according to the annual British Social Attitudes survey. Satisfaction dropped seven percentage points to 65% in the 2017 study, making it the first time general practice has not been the highest-rated NHS service. The study showed people were happy with the care given by GPs, but were unhappy about things like waiting times. Public satisfaction with the NHS fell six percentage points from 2016. Hugh Pym analysis: How unhappy is the public with NHS? Only 57% of people were happy with the service - the lowest level since 2011 - while dissatisfaction has risen to 29% - the highest level in a decade. The survey was conducted by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and analysed by the Nuffield Trust and the King's Fund think tanks. A nationally representative sample of 3,004 people in England, Scotland and Wales were asked about their overall satisfaction with the NHS and 1,002  of them were also quizzed about their satisfaction with individual NHS services. The main reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the overall service were: Satisfaction - quality of care free at the point of use attitudes and behaviour of NHS staff range of services and treatments available Dissatisfaction - staff shortages long waiting times lack of funding government reforms ""The public used to put GPs on a pedestal,"" said Ruth Robertson, fellow at the King's Fund. ""But since 2009, when there was an 80% satisfaction rating, it has been steadily declining. ""It shows the impact of the huge pressure on GPs and the public is responding to that."" NHS Tracker: Check targets in your area NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff Did the NHS avert disaster this winter? Missed NHS targets spell trouble However, Ms Robertson was keen to stress that the NHS was still highly valued by the public. ""More people are satisfied with the NHS than are dissatisfied,"" she said. ""They showed really strong support for the core value principles of the NHS. ""I think this shows that it is not falling out of favour, but people are worried about the NHS and they are worried about funding and staffing shortages."" The age group which was most satisfied with GPs was people aged over 65 and Ms Robertson added: ""This is because they see GPs more often so build up a stronger personal relationship with them."" Prof John Appleby, chief economist and director of research at the Nuffield Trust, told the BBC: ""These results should make the government sit up and take notice. ""If they want to see satisfaction rise, my suggestion is they should think seriously now about more money for healthcare over the next few years. ""The public are concerned about headline measures and things they really notice like waiting times. ""We have seen over the last 18 months or two years increasingly hospitals miss their targets in terms of their A&E waiting times and their inpatient waiting times. ""We know that people are increasingly dissatisfied with their access to getting GP appointments and so on, so there is clearly something to be done. ""It's not just about money to fix these problems but these are the things that the public notice and they care about, so it's something that the government should also notice and care about."" Rare photographs that changed lives Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law How cold is it where you are? An Ipsos/Mori poll published at the start of Februaryshowed that nearly half the public felt the biggest issue facing Britain was the NHS (48%), more than those with concerns about Brexit (46%).,external Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This is extremely distressing news for hard-pressed GPs and their teams who are working flat out to do the very best they can for their patients in increasingly difficult circumstances. ""But while we are very disappointed in these figures, they are hardly surprising as what we are seeing now is symptomatic of the inevitable effects of a decade of underinvestment in our family doctor service - and just not having enough GPs in the system to meet demand. ""Our service is the lifeblood of the NHS - we manage risk and uncertainty as well as considering all aspects of our patients' lives when delivering care. ""Without general practice, other NHS services would crumble, but we urgently need more support, including more GPs, if we are to deliver the safe and effective care that our patients need and have come to rely on."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Just last year, the NHS was rated as the best and safest health system in the world by independent experts and, as this report itself points out, the majority of patients are satisfied with the NHS."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This report exposes widespread public dissatisfaction with NHS performance under this government, as years of overstretched budgets take their toll on frontline services.""

Toys R Us and Maplin on brink of collapse,"Toys R Us in the UK and electronics chain Maplin are on the brink of collapse, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. The struggling retailers - two of the UK's best known chains - are understood to have put administrators on standby after failing to secure a rescue deal. Maplin - owned by Rutland Partners - had put the business up for sale, but talks with a potential buyer are understood to have broken down. Toys R Us was also seeking a possible sale but has failed to secure a buyer. Maplin has 200 stores and 2,500 staff in the UK, while Toys R Us employs about 3,000 workers in its 105 stores. Maplin in talks with potential buyers The toy chain in the UK - whose US owner filed for bankruptcy protection last September - is facing an imminent deadline for a Â£15m VAT bill which it will not be able to pay without selling the business. It had managed to stave off collapse in December byagreeing a rescue planto allow it to restructure its operations, including the closure of at least 26 stores planned for this Spring. But with poor sales continuing into the new year and the VAT bill looming, the only route left for the firm to continue trading was to find a buyer which is now understood to be unlikely. Maplin was reported to be in talks with Edinburgh Woolen Mill over a sale Meanwhile, Maplin had been in talks with Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the  clothing company that owns Peacocks, Country Casuals and several other retailers, over a possible sale, according to Sky News. The move came after insurers cut credit cover last year because of Maplin's falling profits. The breakdown of the sale talks means that administration is now the most likely outcome for the firm. Toys R Us and Maplin are the latest of a string of well-known retailers to run into financial problems in recent months. Clothing chain New Look and department store chainHouse of Fraserare seeking financial support from landlords and other creditors. Meanwhile, bed retailer Warren Evans, Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East and High Street furniture chainsFeather & BlackandMultiyorkhave all recently fallen into administration. Toys R Us is understood to have made a loss for seven out of the past eight years of trading Toys R Us in the UK has blamed its problems on its ""warehouse-style stores"". It opened these in the 1980s and 1990s, but it said in December that they had become ""too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". The UK business is understood to have made a loss for seven out of the past eight years of trading. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight With Passion, said both Toys R Us and Maplin had cut staffing to try to cut costs, which had led to poor service in the shops. She said for Toys R Us, the problem was particularly acute because it sold mainly branded goods. ""Therefore to succeed you need to offer some kind of differentiating factor - either a good discount or an experience that makes visiting the stores worthwhile. ""Toys R Us didn't move with the times. It didn't do discounts or retail theatre,"" she said.

EU to publish first draft of Brexit treaty,"The draft withdrawal treaty will set out the options for supporting cross-border trade and traffic Boris Johnson has said the row over the border in Northern Ireland is being used to frustrate Brexit. The foreign secretary insisted there were ""very good solutions"" to avoid the need for a hard border. There is a stand-off on the issue with the EU publishing alegal draft,externalof its Brexit withdrawal agreement. An option for Northern Ireland to follow EU rules to avoid a ""hard border"" - if an alternative arrangement is not agreed - has sparked a row. The Democratic Unionist Party, which offers vital support in key votes to the Tory government, says details of the draft treaty have ""fundamentally breached"" an agreement reached in Brussels late last year. Conservative Brexiteers say it is ""completely unacceptable"" and would effectively annex Northern Ireland. The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, unveiling the draft agreement, described this Northern Ireland border option as a ""backstop"" if no other proposals are found. And a former EU commissioner said it was down to the UK to come up with a solution, warning that ""at a high pace we are heading to the cliff edge"". BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was shaping up to become ""the big Brexit bust-up"" with both sides of the argument refusing to budge. How to read the draft Brexit treaty Why English courts are opening in the EU Brexit: All you need to know Mr Johnson faced criticisism on Tuesday for suggesting in a BBC interview the issue of the border could be managed as easily as London's congestion charging zone. Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, he said: ""What is going on at the moment is that the issue of the Northern Irish border is being used quite a lot politically to try and keep the UK in the customs union - effectively the single market - so we cannot really leave the EU. That is what is going on."" This video can not be played Will the bridge that unites the two villages be used to divide them? ""If the EU or Dublin believes the UK government will be signing up to a border in the Irish Sea, they are deluded,"" said senior DUP member Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr Donaldson argued the draft divorce treaty would also undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in the Belfast Agreement. Boris Johnson spoke to reporters after braving the snow for a jog That 1998 treaty - also known as the Good Friday Agreement - between the British and Irish governments and most political parties in Northern Ireland decided how the region would be governed and brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict. Former Brexit minister David Jones told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the EU was proposing that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union, and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""That effectively amounts to an annexure of Northern Ireland by the European Union,"" he said, adding: ""I think that it would be pretty catastrophic and I think that the European Union in actually proposing this is behaving wholly irresponsibly."" This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) But former EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said: ""If you have another solution then please come up with it."" All of the UK's proposals so far have been ""mutually incompatible"", he added. And Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE that in order to avoid the backstop being triggered,  ""it is up to the UK to bring proposals to the table to make that possible"". He added: ""It's not OK for people, whether pro-Brexit politicians in Britain, people or parties in Northern Ireland, to just say 'no' now."" Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition Boris Johnson: Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Fox warning of customs union 'sellout' The draft document aims to encapsulate - in legally binding language - agreements already reached on Ireland, citizens' rights and the UK's so-called ""divorce bill"". It mandates that during the Brexit transition, which it says should last only until the end of 2020, the UK must continue to comply with all existing EU legislation. It would however lose all voting rights and decision-making power, including on any rules adopted by the 27 remaining member states. EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the document will not contain any surprises because it translates the political pledges made by both sides in the talks so far. ""The clock is ticking; time is short,"" Mr Barnier said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""I am concerned."" Theresa May wants trade to be frictionless across the Irish border after Brexit. But there is plenty of political friction as every potential solution seems to bring a new problem. In a leaked letter designed to demonstrate that there would be no need for new infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Boris Johnson used a potentially toxic phrase: ""even IF there is a hard border"". This allowed critics to suggest that a regime of border checks which would be anathema to republicans, nationalists and the Irish government was being contemplated. Downing Street swiftly reiterated its commitment to no hard border. But one of the solutions - indeed, the most detailed option - being put forward by the EU would keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU regulations. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson has said the government cannot sign up to what would in effect be a border in the Irish Sea. And with rebellions threatened by some of her own backbenchers, Mrs May is likely to need the DUP's MPs to deliver the Brexit she's promising. The prime minister's office has categorically dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit. The statement on Tuesday evening followed the leak of a letter to the prime minister from Mr Johnson, in which he appeared to contemplate the possibility of future customs border checks, after the UK, including Northern Ireland leaves the EU customs union. The leaked letter, obtained by Sky News, quoted Mr Johnson telling the prime minister the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland would continue to leave 95% of traffic to pass unchecked. Following the letter's emergence, Labour called for Mr Johnson - one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet - to be dismissed ""before he can do any more damage"". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said the letter was ""designed to outline how a highly facilitated border would work and help to make a successful Brexit"". ""It shows how we could manage a border without infrastructure or related checks and controls while protecting UK, Northern Ireland, Irish and EU interests.""

"'Bullied for the way I looked'More than half of children aged 11 to 16 say they have been bullied about the way they look, survey finds.8h8 hours agoFamily & Education","Hannah Lewis was bullied about her appearance ""Hannah Lewis is a big, fat, lanky slag with greasy hair, a spotty face and a big nose. ""Those words haunted me throughout my adolescence,"" says Hannah, now 24. ""Being the tallest in my class and developing early meant that I was always 'different' from the other children,"" she recalls. But her experience is not uncommon, YMCA research finds, with more than half (55%) of children saying they had been bullied about the way they looked. For its research - In Your Face - the youth charity surveyed 1,006 youngsters aged 11 to 16 across the UK and carried out focus groups in 12 different UK locations. It found that of those who had experienced appearance-based taunting: 60% had tried to change the way they looked 53% said they became anxious 29% said they said they became depressed 24% said they had reduced the amount they ate ""It makes me not want to come into school and it makes it harder in lessons,"" one young person from the Vale of Glamorgan told YMCA researchers. ""With my experiences, without my mum boosting up my confidence, for me to have been able to have got through the 11 years of school, without her giving me that boost and other members of my family, I wouldn't have been able to get through it,"" said another from Nottinghamshire. For 54% of victims, the bullying had started by the age of 10. This was true for Hannah who says the taunting began at primary school. ""From the age of nine, I encountered remarks from the other children about how I already had teenage spots, how I was a 'freak' for being so tall and how old I looked for my age,"" she says. ""You take what they say as fact, so your perception of how you really look becomes distorted - you expect the truth to be what you've been told."" She says being bullied from a young age contributed to her developing body dysmorphic disorder, which is when someone becomes obsessed with imaginary defects in their appearance. 'Selfie' body image warning issued Does social media impact on body image? While therapy has helped her deal with the obsessive element of the disorder, Hannah says she still suffers with low self-esteem. ""What's helped me is focusing on my personal qualities - my skills, my abilities in my studies, my sense of humour."" The YMCA is urging secondary schools in England and Wales to make use of itsbody confidence campaign toolkit,externalwhich offers guidance, materials and advice on teaching about improving young people's body confidence. Hannah, who now volunteers for the YMCA to raise awareness about body confidence, adds: ""Difference and diversity should be celebrated, and young people should always be reminded that in the future, colleges and universities are going to look at grades, efforts and personal achievements, rather than popularity and appearance. ""We need to teach them to appreciate all the things that their body can do as opposed to just what it looks like."" Denise Hatton, chief executive of the YMCA England & Wales, says: ""Bullying has always existed among young people, but this generation face increasing pressure to live up to unrealistic beauty ideals which they say come from celebrities, social media and the media. ""It's crucial that we teach young people how to feel comfortable in their own body and that looking different isn't a bad thing. ""We know from previous research that young people who have learned about body confidence at school feel better about their bodies.""

Trump son-in-law's security clearance downgradedPresident Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser will no longer receive top-level briefings.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada,"Mr Kushner will no longer receive a daily secret intelligence report President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has had his White House security clearance downgraded, US media are reporting. Mr Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, had been receiving top-level security briefings. However, background checks into Mr Kushner had still not been completed, so he had interim clearance only. He and other White House aides who have yet to receive permanent clearance will not now get top-level briefings. Mr Kushner, who is married to Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, had access to the President's Daily Brief, a secret intelligence report. The moves were confirmed by Mr Kushner's lawyer to Politico, and by two unnamed officials to the Reuters news agency. Politico reported that the 37-year-old was informed of the decision on Friday. Politico quoted Mr Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell,externalas saying that it would ""not affect Mr Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president"". A spokesperson for Mr Kushner told the BBC in a statement: ""Those involved in the process again have confirmed that there are dozens of people at Mr Kushner's level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for these clearance reviews to take this long in a new administration, and that the current backlogs are now being addressed."" It comes as the White House moves to impose greater discipline on access to secrets. General John Kelly, Mr Trump's chief of staff, said earlier this month that he would be limiting the number of people with top-level security clearance. It emerged that the president's former staff secretary, Rob Porter, had been able to work with interim security clearance despite allegations of domestic abuse. The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear The news of the change in Mr Kushner's status followed the announcement hours earlier that his spokesman Josh Raffel was to leave the White House. Meanwhile,the Washington Post reported,externalthat Mr Kushner's contacts with certain foreign government officials have raised concerns with the White House. The newspaper, citing current and former US officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter, reported that officials in the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico have privately discussed ways in which they could take advantage of Mr Kushner and his business arrangements. Mr Kushner was given a wide brief in his role as a White House adviser despite a lack of political experience. He was tasked with brokering a Middle East peace deal and liaising with Mexico. But he had faced problems with his background checks as he sought to obtain permanent security clearance. Who are the people around the president? The wealthy New York real estate developer had to refile the national security questionnaire required of all prospective White House employees after making a number of omissions. Last October, the head of the National Background Investigations Bureau told Congress he has ""never seen that level of mistakes"" on any security clearance application. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Jared Kushner, who according to the Washington Post had requested more information from the intelligence community,externalthan any White House employee not on the National Security Council, has had his wings clipped - at least for now. The administration may insist that Mr Kushner can continue to work on his sweeping portfolio of duties unhindered. His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, may say that this is a normal process and there are no concerns. The reality, however, is that this is an embarrassing development for the presidential son-in-law. He no longer has access to the presidential daily briefing. And, when dealing with foreign officials, he won't have the most sensitive information about their interests and actions. The problem for the White House could extend beyond just Mr Kushner, however. According to an NBC News report, as of November more than 130 administration employees were working under temporary security clearances, including Ivanka Trump and White House counsel Don McGahn. Mr Kushner may be the first, and one of the most influential, individuals to be revealed to have had a security downgrade - but he may not be the last. This video can not be played Jared Kushner has a long list of things to do And last week, it was reported that a senior Justice Department official had told the White House that their investigations would further delay Mr Kushner's security clearance. The information was reportedly passed on to the White House by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the special counsel investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Two weeks ago, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said that presidential aides with interim security clearances should have only ""limited"" access to secret information.

Hundreds of schools closed as snow hits,"Traffic on the M80 between Glasgow and Stirling was brought to a standstill for several hours as emergency services worked to clear a series of accidents A red alert for snow is in force for many of Scotland's most highly-populated areas as blizzard conditions left some motorists stranded for hours on roads in the central belt. Trains, flights and many bus services in the affected areas have stopped. Driving conditions are treacherous, and people have been told not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary. The red warning of major disruption and potential risk to life will be in place until 10:00 on Thursday. It covers Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside, Fife and Central, as well as parts of south east Scotland and the Borders. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland that the country was experiencing ""unprecedented weather"" with many people saying it was the worst snow they had ever seen. Some gritters on the M80 and A720 were given a police escort to help them get through traffic to treat problem areas, with a series of minor accidents causing long tailbacks that left cars at a standstill for several hours. Live updates as red warning in force Where to find updates on school closures In pictures: Best shots from around the UK Video: Scotland hit by Beast from the East Red Cross gives bedding to passengers One of those stuck on the M80 was Michael Blair, who said he had stopped for fuel at Old Inns, near Cumbernauld, at about 14:30 and had moved less than a mile in the four hours since. Mr Blair, who was trying to get to Perthshire, said: ""We have no idea how long we are going to be here."" The emergency services stopped any other vehicles going onto the road as they worked to clear the tailbacks. Glasgow Airport will be closed to all flights until at least 11:00 on Thursday,with about 200 people said to still be inside the terminal on Wednesday evening. Employers had been encouraged to send staff home early ahead of the red warning coming into effect at 15:00 on Wednesday. It is the first time a red alert for snow has ever been issued in Scotland, and only the second time anywhere in the UK. A satellite image showed snow covering most of the UK A red warning means extreme weather is expected, with people urged to take immediate action to keep themselves and others safe from the impact of the weather. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely, and people must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities. The warning came after the so-called Beast from the East caused major problems across most of Scotland earlier on Wednesday, with more than 1,600 schools shut and transport badly affected. About 11cm (4in) of snow had fallen in the centre of Glasgow by lunchtime on Tuesday, with First Bus saying its services in the city and surrounding areas would stop by 16:00, while Lothian Buses stopped its services at 19:00. The British Red Cross has used specially equipped 4x4 vehicles to supply bedding for people at Glasgow Airport in case passengers are stranded overnight. Other airports, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen, have also seen disruption. No trains will run on the West Coast Main Line between Scotland and England until at least lunchtime on Thursday, and the Forth Road Bridge has been closed to all traffic, with vehicles being diverted to the Queensferry Crossing. And Glasgow's subway system closed at 19:00 to allow staff to go home. Motorists have been told to only take to the roads if it is absolutely necessary The Met Office said: ""Heavy snow showers and drifting of lying snow in the strong easterly winds will become more widespread across the area later on Wednesday afternoon, through the evening and overnight into Thursday. ""Roads will become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. Long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel are expected."" It also said some rural communities could become cut off for several day, and warned of the potential for long interruptions to power supplies and other services. Mr Yousaf said the authorities were doing their best to get gritters to the worst affected areas, with emergency services ensuring that people stuck on roads such as the M80 had enough provisions. Speaking to the Reporting Scotland programme, he said people had heeded warnings not to travel ""to an extent"", with traffic much lighter than would normally be the case and many employers being ""extremely flexible"" in allowing staff to go home early or work from home. But he added: ""I have seen HGVs that are carrying home furniture, stationery and piping. I am not convinced that is necessary, and a lot of the incidents we have seen have been caused by a loss of traction by HGVs, so not everybody has been listening or heeding that advice."" Mr Yousaf stressed: ""The advice still remains - please avoid all travel not only if you are in the red warning area, but also if you are in the amber warning area which we know doesn't finish until Thursday at 6pm."" About 11cm (4in) of snow has fallen in Glasgow All 11 SPFL football matches scheduled for Wednesday evening have been cancelled. More than 450,000 pupils were off school on Wednesday, with the vast majority to remain closed on Thursday. Parents should check their local council's website and social media pages for updates. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has said it is cancelling all routine elective procedures and outpatient appointments on Thursday because of the weather conditions, although emergency and essential elective procedures will still go ahead. Staff managed to clear the runway at Glasgow Airport briefly, but flights remain cancelled Rail services have stopped in areas covered by the red warning Several universities are also closed, including Glasgow, Strathclyde and Stirling. About 27,000 homes in Aberdeenshire were left without power for less than an hour on Wednesday morning, but Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said this had not been due to the weather. Virgin Trains said the route between Carlisle and Scotland is closed with no trains or replacement buses running, because of the weather. Alternative rail routes between England and Scotland are also ""severely disrupted"". The current Met Office warning system came into force in 2011, after heavy snow in December of the previous year left motorists stranded overnight on the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh. This is the ninth red weather warning of any type for anywhere in the UK since then, and only the second ever red snow warning in the UK - and the first issued for snow in Scotland. The last red warning was on 29 January 2016 for storm force winds across Orkney and Shetland On 26 December 2015 a red alert for heavy rain was issued across Lancashire and Yorkshire. 5 December 2015 for heavy rain across parts of Cumbria and the Scottish Borders (Storm Desmond) 12 February 2014 for severe gales across Wales and northern England 18 January 2013 for snow in south Wales 7 July 2012 for rain in south west Devon and east Cornwall 3 January 2012 for storm force winds in the Central Belt of Scotland 8 December 2011 for severe gales in central and southern Scotland Police Scotland also repeated its advice for people not to travel. Ch Supt Stewart Carles, head of the force's road policing unit, said: ""The warning covers the commuter periods both this evening and tomorrow morning. ""So we would ask people to think very carefully about making alternative arrangements for these times and to consider whether they really need to make that journey, particularly on the road network which may become overwhelmed as people leave work early to beat the storm. ""We'd urge employers to be as flexible as possible in terms of their staff perhaps not being able being able to come to their normal places of work and to consider alternatives.""

Mark Wareham said tankers were unable to get ""anywhere near"" Sunnyside Farm in Trudoxhill, near Frome, for two days. He said: ""It's a massive impact - dairy farming is tight enough and hard enough without losing money, but what can you do? You've just got to get on with it."" An elderly couple in the Scottish Borders whose remote home was surrounded by 12ft snow-driftshave been rescued, along with their two dogs. The pair, aged 70 and 71, had no heating and had run out of firewood when they were dug out of their West Linton home by two police officers. They had to be dug out after their Scottish Borders house became surrounded by snow-drifts Network Rail's latest statement makes clear that the extreme weather is continuing to cause major problems. It says: ""Our teams are putting in a huge amount of work to keep the railway running and passengers on the move. ""However, there has been, and continues to be,
significant snow in many areas and strong winds are causing it to drift, which
is presenting a real challenge for workers on the ground."" The company says that, with temperatures expected to rise, it will be looking at its areas of flood risk, including checking bridges.

"Labour activists urge harassment actionLabourToo says inappropriate behaviour has been taking place at ""all levels"" of the party.6h6 hours agoUK Politics","Labour activists have submitted a dossier to Jeremy Corbyn detailing claims of harassment, intimidation and abuse ""at all levels"" in the party. The 43 anonymised cases in the LabourToo report cover women describing themselves as party staff, activists, politicians and candidates. They complain of behaviour ranging from inappropriate touching to rape. It comes as MPs prepare to debate proposals for a new complaints and grievance system for Parliament. The new procedures were drawn up by Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom in the wake of a rash of complaints of inappropriate behaviour last autumn, which led to the resignations of two Conservative cabinet ministers and the suspension of a number of both Tory and Labour MPs.

""Sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination is not restricted to the corridors of Westminster, but is taking place at all levels within the Labour Party,"" they said.

"'Bucket list' killer jailed for 28 yearsBriton Jemma Lilley garroted, stabbed and buried the body of Aaron Pajich at her home in Australia.2m2 minutes agoLincolnshire","Police said Jemma Lilley, pictured, had tarpaulins at her house where Aaron Pajich was killed A woman who had an ""obsession"" with serial killers and had murder on her ""bucket list"" has been jailed for killing a teenager. Jemma Lilley, previously of Stamford, Lincolnshire, garrotted, stabbed and buried Aaron Pajich at her home in Perth, Australia. The 26-year-old was convicted alongside housemate Trudi Lenon at the Supreme Court of Western Australia in November. The pair have been sentenced to life with a minimum jail term of 28 years. During a four-week trial, prosecutor James McTaggart told the court Lilley was so ""full of herself and euphoric"" after the killing she could not help boasting to a work colleague. How ""euphoric"" killers' murder plot was hatched Jurors were told Lilley, who had a troubled childhood, had emigrated to Australia in 2010. She developed what prosecutors described as a long-term fascination with horror films, murder and serial killers. Lilley idolised horror film character Freddy Krueger, and had previously told a friend she wanted to kill before she turned 25. The supermarket shelf-stacker had also penned a book about a serial killer named SOS - a nickname she used during online exchanges with accomplice Lenon. Aaron Pajich's mother Sharon Pajich said he was 'my precious little boy, full of life' The pair met through a friend and became close, eventually moving in together about two months before the killing. Both women exchanged homicidal fantasies which gradually intensified until they lured Mr Pajich to his death. In the weeks before, they bought various supplies, including a circular saw and 100 litres of hydrochloric acid. Lilley's stepmother Nina said she had ""always had an obsession with serial killers"" but this had been ""a way of venting her frustration of what happened when she was a child"". Speaking to The Times after the conviction, Ms Lilley, 48, said: ""The book was a big problem with me. At the beginning I was 'fair enough you want to write a horror story', but I didn't like the contents of it."" Mr Pajich was lured to his death on 13 June 2016 and buried in a shallow grave covered with concrete and tiles, with both defendants blaming each other for the killing. Lenon, 43, told the court Lilley approached the teenager from behind as he installed games on her computer, garroted him until the wire broke then stabbed him three times. Aaron's mother Sharon Pajich said Lilley and Lenon were ""disgusting animals"" who should never be released. The pair were sentenced on Wednesday.

"Driver 'hit woman in anti-Muslim attack'Paul Moore struck the Somali woman twice days after a bomb blast in London, a court hears.10h10 hours agoLeicester","Paul Moore is also accused of deliberately driving his car at a 12-year-old Somali girl in Butterwick Drive A motorist deliberately drove into a Somali woman twice in an anti-Muslim attack days after a bomb blast in London, a court heard. Zaynab Hussein was hit by Paul Moore's car in Leicester, moments before he tried to drive at a Somali girl, 12, Nottingham Crown Court was told. Mr Moore, 21, set out to kill five days after the Parsons Green Tube attack last September, prosecutors said. Mr Moore denies attempted murder but does not deny being the driver. Live updates from the East Midlands Prosecutor Jonathan Straw said the defendant, of Letchworth Road, Leicester, struck Ms Hussein, who was wearing a hijab, in Acer Close, and subsequently drove over again seconds later. The attack, on 20 September last year, was ""purely because of the colour of her skin"" and her ""perceived Islamic faith"", Mr Straw said. ""It is no coincidence, we say, that there had been a bomb at Parsons Green Tube station in London, said to have been carried out by sympathisers of Islamic State,"" he told the court. Mr Moore also denies attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving and driving above the legal alcohol limit. He told friends in the car he wanted to run someone over and laughed after hitting Ms Hussein, the jury heard. In a statement to police, Ms Hussein described how she was thrown into the wall of a nearby house by the impact of the crash. ""When I hit the floor, I saw blood coming from my forehead,"" the court heard. ""I remember shouting for help but nobody was around, I tried to get up, but could not.  I didn't have any feeling in my right arm and I thought it might have been broken. ""So, I tried to reach for my mobile with my left hand, but could not find any feeling in my left arm."" Ms Hussein was taken to hospital with severe fractures to her pelvis, spine and breaks to her limbs. After months of specialist treatment, she remains confined to bed. The jury was told, after targeting Ms Hussein, Mr Moore went on to try to hit the Somali girl on her way to school, in nearby Butterwick Drive. In that instance he only clipped her side, sending her school bag flying. The trial continues.

"Lewinsky: Clinton affair an abuse of powerMonica Lewinsky, who had an infamous affair with the president, reflects after the #MeToo movement.5h5 hours agoUS & Canada","Ms Lewinsky and President Clinton had a sporadic affair which began in 1995 Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with former president Bill Clinton, has said their relationship constituted a ""gross abuse of power"" on his part. Ms Lewinsky was 22 when she became romantically involved with the then president, who was 27 years her senior. She has written an article for Vanity Fair magazine,external, reflecting on events after the #MeToo movement. She also revealed that she was diagnosed with PTSD after the scandal. The condition was caused by being ""publicly outed and ostracised"" as the affair unravelled in the press and courts, she says. News of their relationship dominated the US news agenda in 1998 and 1999, after the president initially denied it before admitting to ""inappropriate intimate physical contact"" with the former White House intern. Gillibrand: Bill Clinton should have resigned 1998 BBC archive report: Sex, lies and impeachment,external How #MeToo is exposing scale of abuse House Republicans impeached the president, arguing he had lied to federal investigators, but Mr Clinton was acquitted in the Senate. He remained in power until 2001. The scandal was triggered after a friend of Ms Lewinsky recorded their conversations detailing the affair In the magazine piece, Ms Lewinsky, now 44, says she stands by her 2014 comments that their relationship was consensual, but muses about the ""vast power differentials"" that existed between the two. Ms Lewinsky says she had ""limited understanding of the consequences"" at the time, and regrets the affair daily. ""The dictionary definition of ""consent""? To give permission for something to happen,"" she wrote. ""And yet what did the 'something' mean in this instance, given the power dynamics, his position, and my age?...He was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better."" Special prosecutor Kenneth Star tried to force Ms Lewinsky to testify against Mr Clinton Since re-emerging into the public eye in 2014,Ms Lewinsky has regularly spoken out publicly against cyberbullying, calling herself ""patient zero"" of the internet trend. In the Vanity Fair essay, she also discusses the growing movement of women publicly speaking out against sexual harassment and assault. She writes that she was moved to tears after being contacted by one of the leaders of the #MeToo movement, who expressed sympathy that Ms Lewinsky was ""so alone"" during the affair.

"Satisfaction with GP services slumpsAnd overall public happiness with the NHS falls to its lowest level since 2011, a survey finds.1h31 minutes agoHealth","This video can not be played Government must give more money to healthcare, says professor Public satisfaction with GP services has fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1983, according to the annual British Social Attitudes survey. Satisfaction dropped seven percentage points to 65% in the 2017 study, making it the first time general practice has not been the highest-rated NHS service. The study showed people were happy with the care given by GPs, but were unhappy about things like waiting times. Public satisfaction with the NHS fell six percentage points from 2016. Hugh Pym analysis: How unhappy is the public with NHS? Only 57% of people were happy with the service - the lowest level since 2011 - while dissatisfaction has risen to 29% - the highest level in a decade. The survey was conducted by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and analysed by the Nuffield Trust and the King's Fund think tanks. A nationally representative sample of 3,004 people in England, Scotland and Wales were asked about their overall satisfaction with the NHS and 1,002  of them were also quizzed about their satisfaction with individual NHS services. The main reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the overall service were: Satisfaction - quality of care free at the point of use attitudes and behaviour of NHS staff range of services and treatments available Dissatisfaction - staff shortages long waiting times lack of funding government reforms ""The public used to put GPs on a pedestal,"" said Ruth Robertson, fellow at the King's Fund. ""But since 2009, when there was an 80% satisfaction rating, it has been steadily declining. ""It shows the impact of the huge pressure on GPs and the public is responding to that."" NHS Tracker: Check targets in your area NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff Did the NHS avert disaster this winter? Missed NHS targets spell trouble However, Ms Robertson was keen to stress that the NHS was still highly valued by the public. ""More people are satisfied with the NHS than are dissatisfied,"" she said. ""They showed really strong support for the core value principles of the NHS. ""I think this shows that it is not falling out of favour, but people are worried about the NHS and they are worried about funding and staffing shortages."" The age group which was most satisfied with GPs was people aged over 65 and Ms Robertson added: ""This is because they see GPs more often so build up a stronger personal relationship with them."" Prof John Appleby, chief economist and director of research at the Nuffield Trust, told the BBC: ""These results should make the government sit up and take notice. ""If they want to see satisfaction rise, my suggestion is they should think seriously now about more money for healthcare over the next few years. ""The public are concerned about headline measures and things they really notice like waiting times. ""We have seen over the last 18 months or two years increasingly hospitals miss their targets in terms of their A&E waiting times and their inpatient waiting times. ""We know that people are increasingly dissatisfied with their access to getting GP appointments and so on, so there is clearly something to be done. ""It's not just about money to fix these problems but these are the things that the public notice and they care about, so it's something that the government should also notice and care about."" Rare photographs that changed lives Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law How cold is it where you are? An Ipsos/Mori poll published at the start of Februaryshowed that nearly half the public felt the biggest issue facing Britain was the NHS (48%), more than those with concerns about Brexit (46%).,external Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This is extremely distressing news for hard-pressed GPs and their teams who are working flat out to do the very best they can for their patients in increasingly difficult circumstances. ""But while we are very disappointed in these figures, they are hardly surprising as what we are seeing now is symptomatic of the inevitable effects of a decade of underinvestment in our family doctor service - and just not having enough GPs in the system to meet demand. ""Our service is the lifeblood of the NHS - we manage risk and uncertainty as well as considering all aspects of our patients' lives when delivering care. ""Without general practice, other NHS services would crumble, but we urgently need more support, including more GPs, if we are to deliver the safe and effective care that our patients need and have come to rely on."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Just last year, the NHS was rated as the best and safest health system in the world by independent experts and, as this report itself points out, the majority of patients are satisfied with the NHS."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This report exposes widespread public dissatisfaction with NHS performance under this government, as years of overstretched budgets take their toll on frontline services.""

Toys R Us and Maplin on brink of collapseThe two chains are understood to have put administrators on standby after failing to secure sale deals.1han hour agoBusiness,"Toys R Us in the UK and electronics chain Maplin are on the brink of collapse, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. The struggling retailers - two of the UK's best known chains - are understood to have put administrators on standby after failing to secure a rescue deal. Maplin - owned by Rutland Partners - had put the business up for sale, but talks with a potential buyer are understood to have broken down. Toys R Us was also seeking a possible sale but has failed to secure a buyer. Maplin has 200 stores and 2,500 staff in the UK, while Toys R Us employs about 3,000 workers in its 105 stores. Maplin in talks with potential buyers The toy chain in the UK - whose US owner filed for bankruptcy protection last September - is facing an imminent deadline for a Â£15m VAT bill which it will not be able to pay without selling the business. It had managed to stave off collapse in December byagreeing a rescue planto allow it to restructure its operations, including the closure of at least 26 stores planned for this Spring. But with poor sales continuing into the new year and the VAT bill looming, the only route left for the firm to continue trading was to find a buyer which is now understood to be unlikely. Maplin was reported to be in talks with Edinburgh Woolen Mill over a sale Meanwhile, Maplin had been in talks with Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the  clothing company that owns Peacocks, Country Casuals and several other retailers, over a possible sale, according to Sky News. The move came after insurers cut credit cover last year because of Maplin's falling profits. The breakdown of the sale talks means that administration is now the most likely outcome for the firm. Toys R Us and Maplin are the latest of a string of well-known retailers to run into financial problems in recent months. Clothing chain New Look and department store chainHouse of Fraserare seeking financial support from landlords and other creditors. Meanwhile, bed retailer Warren Evans, Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East and High Street furniture chainsFeather & BlackandMultiyorkhave all recently fallen into administration. Toys R Us is understood to have made a loss for seven out of the past eight years of trading Toys R Us in the UK has blamed its problems on its ""warehouse-style stores"". It opened these in the 1980s and 1990s, but it said in December that they had become ""too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". The UK business is understood to have made a loss for seven out of the past eight years of trading. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight With Passion, said both Toys R Us and Maplin had cut staffing to try to cut costs, which had led to poor service in the shops. She said for Toys R Us, the problem was particularly acute because it sold mainly branded goods. ""Therefore to succeed you need to offer some kind of differentiating factor - either a good discount or an experience that makes visiting the stores worthwhile. ""Toys R Us didn't move with the times. It didn't do discounts or retail theatre,"" she said.
