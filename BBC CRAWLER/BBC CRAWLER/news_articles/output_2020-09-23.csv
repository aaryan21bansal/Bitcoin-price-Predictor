Daily reported UK Covid cases rise by a quarter,"The number of daily reported Covid-19 cases has risen by a quarter, according to the latest UK government figures. There have been 6,178 coronavirus cases in the UK in the last 24 hours, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said it was ""essential"" the public followed the new measures brought in to curb the spread. Tighter restrictions were announced across the UK on Tuesday, including a 22:00 closing time for pubsin England,external. People are being told to work from home if they can, rules on face coverings have been expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings in England has been halved. 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' Where do I have to wear a face covering now? New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Meanwhile,Scotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. In Walesthere were a further 389 casesand in Northern Irelandthere were 220 cases in the past 24 hours,external. Reacting to the UK figures, Ms Doyle said: ""New measures have been bought in to stop the spread of the virus and it is essential that you follow them. ""You should work from home if you can, must now wear a face covering in retail and hospitality settings, unless you are eating or drinking, and not be in a group larger than six people. Announcing the tighter restrictions for England on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said theymight have to stay in place for up to six months. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said the need for new Covid restrictions was not down to an ""act of God"" but a ""failure of government"" In a televised response to the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported the further ""necessary"" restrictions introduced by the government. But he said The government needed to ""fix"" testing ""fast"", saying: ""It's a national scandal that we still don't have a testing system that works,"" and that was ""the only way we can get control of the virus"". ""The return of this virus, and the return of restrictions, are not an act of God,"" he added. ""They're a failure of government."" Referring to reports of people struggling to get hold of coronavirus tests in recent weeks, Sir Keir said: ""People shouldn't have to travel hundreds of miles to get a test for their child, for themselves or for their relatives."" What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? Sir Keir also warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government didn't provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ended. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happensafter the scheme expires at the end of October. We should be very careful about reading too much into a single day's rise - the jump of more than 1,000 is rapid and if repeated would mean daily case numbers doubling in less than a week. But figures can fluctuate from day to day. Nonetheless, the UK has been warned it should be prepared for cases to continue growing. The figure for new cases is well below what was seen at the peak, which was estimated at 100,000 cases a day. We don't know for sure, since a lack of testing meant the system was only picking up the tip of the iceberg then. Clearly we are not picking up all the cases now - the evidence from last week's surveillance report suggested perhaps only half were being identified by the testing programme. What matters now is whether this scale of rise is repeated in the coming days and weeks - and how that translates into hospitalisations and deaths, both of which are going up too. The data from Spain and France suggests that sharp rises can slow, and upward trends in admissions to hospital can be reversed. But, make no mistake, the UK is entering a crucial point in the battle against the virus. Earlier Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measuresamid criticism from some scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"",  casting doubt on the changes of the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - being below one by Christmas. ""To slow the epidemic down will mean putting the brakes on very hard. I suspect we will see very stringent measures coming in through the UK but it will be too late,"" he warned. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Prof Peter Openshaw, a fellow member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a ban on households mixing indoors in England ""ought to be instituted sooner rather than later"", adding, ""If we wait two or three weeks, it will be too late."" The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, also believes it is inevitable England will to have to follow Scotland's latest move,according to the Times,external. Another scientist, Prof Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said it was important to give the new measures time to work, maintain a clear and consistent public message and not to panic. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4.

NHS Covid-19 app launches for the over-16s,"Users will be told to self-isolate if the app determines they are at high risk of being infected More than one million people have downloaded the government's contact-tracing app for England and Wales within its first day of release. NHS Covid-19 instructs users to self-isolate for 14 days if it detects they were nearby someone who has the virus. It also has a check-in scanner to alert owners if a venue they have visited is found to be an outbreak hotspot. Anyone aged 16 and over is being asked to install it. The government plans to give its own download tally on Monday. This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the app ""helps us to find more people who are at risk of having the virus"" that human contact tracers are unable to find. ""Everybody who downloads the app will be helping to protect themselves, helping to protect their loved ones, helping to protect their community because the more people who download it, the more effective it will be,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The app keeps secret who receives a self-isolation alert. And there was some confusion about whether users could ignore a notification telling them to stay at home. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""That self-isolation is voluntary, unlike the mandatory self-isolation if you are called by NHS Test and Trace."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said people might need to ""upgrade"" to access the NHS Covid-19 app But the Department of Health had earlier said that users must obey the command and would in theory be liable for fines of Â£1,000 or more if they did not, while acknowledging it had no way to check. A senior source has since told the BBC that the notification is ""advisory"" because the authorities cannot legally enforce something that cannot be proved. How to use England and Wales' contact-tracing app How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The decision to allow those 16 and over to download the app is a change from trials, which were limited to the over-18s. User will have to verify they are over 16 before they can start using the app The move reflects a desire by health chiefs for the software to be used by as many students in further education colleges and universities as possible. The age limit is in line with the Protect Scotland contact-tracing app. And health chiefs behind Northern Ireland's StopCOVID NI have said they intend to launch a new version that accepts under-18s later this month. The launch comes as the UKreported 6,178 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. The government had originally intended to release the app months ago. But problems with the initial design and the addition of extra features meant it was only ready for its final public test in August. One tech expert who has tracked the initiative acknowledged the team involved had worked hard to address concerns about privacy and transparency, but said wider problems could still limit its impact. ""Not only is the app late to launch, but it will be hindered by the delays in the testing system,"" Rachel Coldicutt told the BBC. ""If you don't have symptoms, will a push notification saying you were near someone a week ago make you and your family self-isolate and spend days hitting refresh on the testing website, trying to find a test?"" Although the app allows users to order a coronavirus test and automatically get the results, the government does not believe it will complicate efforts to meet demand. The app is available for smartphones only - not tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go toAndroid's Google Play,externalorApple's App Store,externaland search for ""NHS Covid-19"". The handsets must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. And some of the latest Huawei handsets are excluded. The notification will tell the recipient to go into self-isolation for a fortnight - and trigger the start of the app's countdown clock. Even if the recipient has no symptoms or a subsequent negative test result, they must stay at home for the duration. Unlike when a human contact tracer orders someone to self-isolate, the app keeps the subject's identity a secret. Those that have not received such an alert, but fill in the app's symptoms checker and meet the criteria, will be directed to self-isolate for eight days. They will also be directed to an external website to book a test. Read more about how the app works in our Q&A Automated contact tracing is designed to complement the work done by humans by helping to identify encounters with strangers - for example, someone standing close to a user while waiting in a queue outside a shop. When someone anonymously shares a positive Covid-19 test result via the app, a process developed by Apple and Google makes other users' smartphones check if they had recently detected the infected person's handset. But smartphones were not designed for this purpose and the readings involved are not always accurate. This has led to fears of ""false positives"" - people being instructed to self-isolate who were never at risk. A publicity campaign will encourage users to download the app to protect others However, health chiefs believe a recent change to the calculations involved should help minimise the problem: they now take into account when the virus-carrier was at their most contagious. One of the app's other major features is a scanner to let it keep track of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other places the user has visited. Hospitality venues in England now face Â£1,000 fines if they do not display an officialTest and Trace poster featuring a QR barcode assigned to them,external. Cinemas, community centres and places of worship are also being asked to display authorised QR barcode posters So far, the government says more than 160,000 businesses have downloaded a unique code for their property. The benefit is that if officials later identify a venue as being at the centre of an outbreak, they can update a database which the phones regularly check for a match. Users can then be told to self-isolate and/or get tested, depending on the circumstances, without having to revealing their identities. Other facilities, including postcode-based threat updates and details of the latest guidance, are intended to encourage people to regularly look at the app and change their behaviour. But a major challenge will be convincing them to download it in the first place: officials suggest only about one in 10 people installed the app during a recent trial in the London Borough of Newham, an area picked for its ethnic diversity. When the BBC visited on Wednesday, a reporter could only find one person using it Scotland's app launched about a fortnight ago, and roughly one in five people there have installed it Ireland, one of the leaders in the field, has still only convinced about one in three people to use its app, which was released in July To encourage adoption in England and Wales, the the major mobile networks have agreed not to deduct data used by the app from subscribers' monthly allowances. In addition, the app now supports more languages than the test version - adding Turkish, Arabic, Mandarin, Romanian and soon Polish. The app provides a risk score for the user's neighbourhood as well as a self-isolation countdown clock And it now allows users to delete individual venue visits from the app's ""digital diary"". This followed feedback from victims of domestic abuse, whose partners often check their phones. One change, however, may be less popular. Those told to go into self-isolation because of a contact-tracing match will not be able to challenge the decision. Adocument published online had indicated,externalthat users would be able to call an NHS 111 operator, who might overrule the command. TESTING:What tests are available?

Breonna Taylor officer charged but not over death,"This video can not be played Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented the grand jury decision A police officer has been charged over the narcotics raid that resulted in the fatal shooting of a black woman at her home in the US state of Kentucky. Breonna Taylor, 26, a hospital worker, was shot multiple times as officers stormed her home on 13 March. Brett Hankison has been charged, not with Ms Taylor's death, but with ""wanton endangerment"" for firing into a neighbour's apartment in Louisville. Two other officers who were involved have not been charged. Under Kentucky law, someone is guilty of wanton endangerment if they commit an act that shows ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". This lowest-level felony offence can come with a five-year sentence for each count. Mr Hankison was charged on three counts. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of US police killings Ms Taylor's relatives and activists for whom her death has become a rallying cry had been calling for the three officers, who are all white, to be charged with murder or manslaughter. But this was rejected by a grand jury that reviewed the evidence. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died On Wednesday, Judge Annie O'Connell announced the charges that had been brought by a grand jury against Mr Hankison. Kentucky Attorney General Mr Cameron then held a news conference in which he expanded on the decision. ""This is a gut-wrenching emotional case,"" he said. ""There is nothing I can offer them today to take away the grief and heartache as a result of losing a child, a niece, a sister and a friend,"" he added in a message to Ms Taylor's family. Mr Cameron said a ballistics report had found that six bullets struck Ms Taylor, but only one was fatal. That analysis concluded that Detective Myles Cosgrove had fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. The attorney general said it was not clear if Mr Hankison's shots had hit Ms Taylor, but they had hit a neighbouring apartment. This video can not be played Protesters march in Louisville following the grand jury decision The top prosecutor said the other two officers - Jonathan Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove - had been ""justified to protect themselves and the justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges"". Mr Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first black attorney general, added: ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. ""Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge."" He added that the FBI was still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. The National Guard were deployed in Louisville ahead of the announcement Ben Crump, a high-profile lawyer for the Taylor family, said the outcome was ""outrageous and offensive"". Officials this month agreed to pay her family $12m (Â£9.3m) in a settlement. Asked for his reaction to the decision, Mr Trump told a White House news conference: ""I thought it was really brilliant."" He praised Kentucky's attorney general, who addressed the Republican party convention last month, for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""I think he's a star,"" he said, adding that he approved of the Kentucky governor's decision to send in the National Guard. Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Kentucky prosecutors to release the evidence that was presented to the grand jury. ""I think having more of the facts out there so people can see, people can truly process it, is where we need to be,"" Mr Beshear told reporters. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville on Tuesday and protests are expected. The National Guard have also been deployed. Mayor Greg Fischer has set a 21:00-06:30 curfew in the city that will remain in place for the next 72 hours. He earlier said he had declared a state of emergency ""due to the potential for civil unrest"". Police have closed traffic on certain streets where protests have been prevalent, and barricades have been erected around the city centre. Demonstrations over Ms Taylor's death have been held in the city for more than 100 consecutive days. The National Guard deployment has been criticised because one of its troops fatally shot a black restaurant owner, David McAtee, as authorities dispersed Black Lives Matter protesters in June. The police department said its officers had come under fire while they were trying to clear the area. But after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras, the city's police chief was sacked. Shortly after midnight on Friday 13 March, she was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when they heard a banging on the door. Plainclothes Louisville police officers were carrying out a narcotics raid, and they used a battering ram to enter the property. A judge had granted a warrant to search Ms Taylor's home because investigators suspected a convicted drug dealer - her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover - was using the address to receive packages. She had no criminal record. Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, later told police he thought the late-night intruder was Glover, according to the New York Times. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI. The death of Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor, who had also got out of bed amid the commotion, was shot and died on the hallway floor. According to an arrest report, the officers had been granted a ""no-knock"" warrant, allowing them to enter the property without warning. But Mr Cameron said on Wednesday the officers had not actually served such a warrant. The attorney general said the officers' statements that they identified themselves ""are corroborated by an independent witness"". Some neighbours told local media they did not hear the officers announce themselves. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County prosecutor Thomas Wine has previously said the search was cancelled after the shooting. The subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Ms Taylor's injuries as ""none"" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used. Mr Walker was initially charged with attempted murder and assault of a police officer, but the case against him was dropped in May amid national scrutiny of the case. From left: Brett Hankison, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove Mr Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after investigators found he had ""wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds"" during the raid, according to his termination letter. Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties. The Louisville Courier-Journal has reported that six officers are under internal police review for their role in the shooting. Seven solutions to US police problems Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Mr Mattingly wrote an email on Saturday to more than 1,000 colleagues in which he criticised city leaders and protesters. ""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,"" he wrote in the message, which was published by media outlets on Tuesday. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonised, and the criminals are canonised."" ""Your civil rights mean nothing,"" he added, ""but the criminal has total autonomy."" Are you in Louisville?

Students told to isolate after 124 test positive,"Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow A major outbreak of Covid-19 at Glasgow University has led to 172 students testing positive. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"", and added that 600 people were self-isolating. Details emerged as Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was ""very concerned"" about outbreaks at  several universities. They include Abertay in Dundee and the University of Aberdeen. The clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence in the city. The university said they involved the Murano Street and Cairncross residences, and were largely due to social activity at the start of Freshers Week, from 12-14 September. In a statement it said: ""The total number of reported cases since the start of term is 124 but the actual number is likely to be higher. ""Over 600 students are isolating across all residences.  We are not aware of any students who have had to receive hospital treatment."" The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland The statement added that those students affected had access to food and other supplies. Advice on medical issues including mental health and wellbeing was also being made available. The Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow, with more than 1,100 student bedrooms. In total, about 2,500 spaces are available in seven residences for students at the city's universities. The university said any students found to be breaking the rules faced disciplinary action including termination of their accommodation contracts and suspension from the university. A mobile testing centre will be set up at Murano and student unions will be closed this weekend. The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland. All 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases at Abertay University. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self-isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts, and promised that if they do so they will not be punished for breaching guidance. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" During Wednesday's daily coronavirus briefing, Prof Leitch described the Glasgow University outbreak as ""significant"" and issued a warning to students about attending house parties. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Thursday, he said: ""I am concerned, very concerned, about higher and further education, I always have been. ""Predictably, we have cases. Every country in the world that has brought universities back has got cases. ""We need to be very, very careful. Even though most of those cases will not get serious illness, some of them will and some of them will potentially spread it to the community."" Prof Leitch initially said students would be allowed to return to their family homes ""but they should think hard about that"". ""If you are not self-isolating and have no symptoms, you can go home for the holidays etc,"" he said. ""But we would ask you to think carefully about that. We don't want too much spread - particularly from high areas to low areas. ""So maybe not as often as you normally would, but it's not illegal."" However, he later tweeted to ""clarify"" that students and their families must adhere to the nationwide ban on household visits. Prof Leitch said: ""To clarify, they are a separate household. There are exceptions, eg caring responsibilities, but the law is clear: they can't meet indoors with another household - even mum and dad. Sorry."" UK health secretaryMatt Hancock has refused to rule out banning students from returning homeat Christmas. One student at Cairncross House told BBC Scotland she was asked to quarantine on Sunday - a week after arriving in the city. Under Scottish government guidelines, students in residences are assigned to ""households"" based on shared facilities such as kitchens. She said two people in her household of eight had tested positive for coronavirus. They are mainly reporting a loss of taste or smell, and a slight fever, she said. It appears to have spread through the residence in Freshers' Week, when students mixed with people outside their households. One of the clusters involves the Cairncross House accommodation ""I don't think people were being too wildly unsensible,"" the student said. ""People were mixing outside of their households because I mean it was Freshers Week, people weren't going to stay in their own kitchens and not do anything. ""But I don't think people were being too crazy. There haven't been massive parties."" She said they have been advised to wear masks when they leave their rooms to use shared kitchens, and to order supermarket deliveries. But she was able to continue her studies as all her classes are online. ""It's a bit strange,"" she said. ""It does get a bit hard to concentrate when you're sitting in your room from 9-5 and you can't go out for a walk to clear your head. ""At the same time, it's nice to have the work to occupy my time. But it's only day three, so it might get harder."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

Brexit: Lorries will need a permit to enter Kent,"Truck drivers will need a permit to enter Kent after the Brexit transition period ends, the government has said. The announcement comes after a letter from cabinet minister Michael Gove warned that queues 7,000-trucks-long could clog up roads around the port of Dover and Channel Tunnel. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said the Kent Access Permit system would be enforced by police and ANPR cameras. It is intended to ensure drivers have all the paperwork they need, he said. Drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to apply for the permits online and show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for no-deal planning, wrote to logistics groups with the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" planning for when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union rules on 1 January. In that scenario, he said just half of big businesses and 20% of small businesses would be ready for the strict application of new EU requirements at the border. ""In those circumstances that could mean between only 30% and 60% of laden HGVs would arrive at the border with the necessary formalities completed for the goods on board,"" he told MPs. ""They'd therefore be turned back by the French border authorities, clogging the Dover to Calais crossing."" He said it could lead to delays of up to two days for drivers waiting to cross the Channel. Although he said those queues were likely to subside after businesses learned from seeing their cargo denied access to the continent. The transition period is due to expire at the end of the year but only a quarter of businesses are ""fully ready"" for the post-Brexit arrangements, Mr Gove said. Imports will also be disrupted in January, according to the letter sent to the freight industry by Mr Gove. It also raises the prospect of a winter spike in Covid-19 leading to absences of port and border staff. Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said: ""It is incredible that ministers are only now admitting to their plans to arrest British truckers for entering Kent without new travel passports. With just over three months to go, how are businesses meant to prepare amid this Conservative carnival of incompetence?'"" What is the Brexit transition period? How many trade deals has the UK done? What do I need to know about Brexit now? A simple guide The picture of chaos at the border might be familiar from a similar set of projections made for no-deal Brexit a year ago as part of what was known as Operation Yellowhammer. The government says this is not a prediction but an illustration of what could be reasonably expected. Moreover, Mr Gove told parliament on Wednesday the government was ""absolutely determined to do everything that we can to secure a deal"". According to the Cabinet Office document, without a free trade deal and in its reasonable worst-case scenario, there may be ""maximum queues of 7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days"". ""Both imports and exports could be disrupted to a similar extent,"" it says. The EU is expected to impose full goods controls on the UK, stopping all freight without the correct documentation at the end of the transition period on 1 January. The disruption is assumed to build in the first two weeks of January, and could last three months, or longer should France rigorously apply Schengen passport checks on hauliers at Dover and the Channel Tunnel. Brexit jargon explained The purpose of this stark communication is to try to get traders to act now to get ready for new border formalities that could help mitigate the disruption. Mr Gove told the industry that this needs to happen irrespective of whether or not there is a deal in the UK-EU trade negotiations. In response the freight industry says putting in place the measures needed to avoid border delays will be ""a huge challenge for government and industry"". Logistics UK, representing road, rail, sea and air haulage firms says it is urging businesses to quickly install and understand the new processes they will need to use. But firms need early access to both UK and EU systems so that they can conduct testing and training before 1 January, it says. A recent meeting between the industry and government was described as a ""washout"", with insiders describing the relationship as ""fraught"" and hauliers fearful that they were being cast as the ""fall guys"" for delays and disruption likely in January. There are further issues should there be no trade deal agreed. Hauliers would have to rely on special permits rationed by the Department for Transport, though a mutually beneficial deal here is possible. But discussions on these issues await settlement of the impasse in negotiations on state aid and fisheries. This video can not be played The government is ""not pointing the finger"" at hauliers, Michael Gove told the BBC Industry sources have raised the possibility that the UK would have to sign up to EU rules limiting driver hours, in order to get access to EU roads. And there is a specific new reference to France imposing strict passport checks at the ""juxtaposed controls"" currently designed to offer seamless travel across the Channel. ""There also remains a risk of continuing disruption caused by Schengen controls being applied rigorously at the juxtaposed controls at the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel,"" the document says.

Sunak to announce new job protection plans,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October. ""I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs throughout the winter,"" he tweeted. The move comes after a day of mounting pressure on the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is understood to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. At the same time,the Treasury said there would be no Budget this autumn. ""Now is not the right time to outline long-term plans - people want to see us focused on the here and now,"" it said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson was urged to act swiftly by Labour and SNP MPs to prevent what one called a ""tsunami of job losses"". And on Wednesday night, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government does not provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ends. In a televised response to yesterday's Prime Ministerial Broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" In a recording, filmed just before news broke that the chancellor will make an announcement tomorrow about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October, he said: ""There was nothing in the Prime Minister's statement last night to protect people's jobs, businesses or our town centres and high streets. The PM said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. The German ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme and its French equivalenthave attracted much attention in the UK from employers and trade unions alike, with both the CBI and the TUC in favour. They fear unemployment could spike when the furlough scheme ends, as firms struggle to keep workers on the payroll. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey called on the government to""stop and rethink"" the furlough scheme, although he did not back any particular alternative. Could the furlough scheme be extended? Julian Metcalfe, the boss of the Itsu restaurant chain and founder of Pret a Manger, said the PM needed to show leadership rather than ""spouting off some Churchillian nonsense that we'll make it through [the winter]"". Boris Johnson said the chancellor is working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions ""The repercussions of these six months, it's going to be devastating to so many people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""People in the hospitality industry, people in work in hotels and restaurants and takeaways and coffee shops - a great many are closing down. We're losing thousands upon thousands of jobs here. ""How long can this continue, this vague 'work from home'?"" Germany's Kurzarbeit: The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"": The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion: A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion: A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage. Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages While there are fears that the cost of a replacement furlough scheme could damage the economy further, others argue that continued government support for jobs is needed to stop unemployment surging from November. Advocates of a salary top-up scheme also point to the fact that both France and Germany have extended their schemes to run for the whole of next year. A short-time working programme could also be cheaper than the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of employees' wages up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has cost Â£39.3bn so far, while the Germans estimate that the bill for Kurzarbeit during the pandemic will reach â¬33.5bn (Â£31bn) by the end of 2021, although that naturally depends on the progress of the pandemic. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson came under pressure from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for more support for businesses going forwards ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. ""We have been saying it for months. When is the prime minister finally going to act?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford says the last thing that 61,000 at-risk Scottish workers want is a hug from Boris Johnson. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said 60,000 workers in Scotland faced being ""sold onto the scrapheap"" if the furlough scheme was not extended while Labour's Graham Morris said there was a risk of ""a tsunami of job losses in the pipeline within 38 days"". In response, the PM acknowledged many firms faced ""very difficult circumstances"" and although an ""indefinite extension"" of the furlough scheme was out of the question, further support was being worked on. ""That is why we are looking at a massive package of investment in jobs and growth in the short, medium and long term,"" he said. ""In addition to the package I set out yesterday, there will be creative and imaginative measures from the chancellor to help people through this crisis.""

Sunak to unveil emergency jobs scheme,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak will later unveil a plan aimed at minimising further unemployment as stricter Covid-19 restrictions come into force. The new measures are expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month. In July, around five million workers were still receiving some or all of their incomethrough the scheme, many in the hospitality sector. Pubs and restaurants have warned they will be hit hard by new restrictions. From Thursday, hospitality venues in England will have to shut at 22:00 BST as the government tries to control the spread of the coronavirus. Scotland is introducing similar measures, with pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST from Friday, while in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 from Thursday. ""Lots of businesses will not survive this and we are going to see more and more people lose their jobs,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality. At around 11:45, the chancellor is expected to address the Commons to unveil plans that the government hopes will stem those job losses. Covid crisis forces Autumn Budget to be scrapped Could UK adopt German or French furlough scheme? The Treasury said the chancellor had been ""preparing contingency plans over the summer in case the pandemic required it"". It is understood Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is also thought to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. The prime minister said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. Mr Sunak also announced on Wednesday that the Autumn Budget would be scrapped this year because of the pandemic. While latest government figures are yet to be released, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates almost three million - or 12% of the workforce - are currently furloughed. Director Paul Johnson said he expected a ""big rise"" in unemployment when the existing furlough scheme expires at the end of next month. ""We've already seen something like a reduction of nearly three quarters of a million... in terms of the number of people on payroll and then we've got at least another two million or so on furlough not working,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""Some of those will likely be supported by this new scheme but not all of them and that implies, I suspect, by the end of the year that we will have something like... two million fewer than we had at the beginning of the year, although oddly that doesn't seem to be translating at the moment into the official unemployment figures."" Cancelling the Budget is a big deal, because of what it shows about the big picture: a government still in crisis mode, having to put off medium-term tough decisions, on tax rises, that would have at least been signalled in the contents of a Budget Red Box. But we will get more spending, more support for jobs. Asthe chancellor told me last week, that does not mean extending the furlough scheme endlessly, but he has been thinking ""creatively"". The discussions with business groups and unions have centred around supporting employers with cash flow constraints to keep viable jobs. The furlough scheme's initial purpose was to support people's wages, expressly for them to stay at home. The new scheme is likely to take inspiration from continental Europe, by subsidising ""short time"" work, that is to say, helping top up pay for workers given fewer hours of work in the crisis. The furlough scheme is regularly lauded by the prime minister, and has undoubtedly been one of the most competently executed policy responses of the Covid crisis. Throw in the fact that the Tory ""red wall"" is more comfortable with use of state spending, and some Tory thinkers advocate a permanent scheme of wage support, such as occurs in Germany. We also expect extensions by weeks or months of the various loan guarantee schemes offered by the Treasury. Already banks are fretting about having to call in some of these loans. Now significant swathes of the economy remain under the shadow of the pandemic and of ongoing social restrictions meant to defeat it. It is difficult to see how a full Spending Review over four years could occur. The Treasury can not calculate the size of the pie to be sliced up. Having a one year review, like last year, also avoids some corrosive internal politics over winners and losers. So more spending, and more jobs support, as infection rates rise, and restrictions look likely to be strengthened rather than loosened, but not yet accounting for how it is all to be paid for, at a time of high and rising public borrowing. The government has been under mounting pressure to extend or replace the furlough scheme, which will wind down next month. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was introduced in March and paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since then, employers have been asked to pay 10% of the wages of those on furlough, plus their National Insurance and pension contributions. Furloughed workers can also now return to work part-time with the government paying for any remaining hours not worked. Could the furlough scheme be extended? How many people are out of work? During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson faced calls from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned tocut up to 6,000 jobsin the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"".

"No case to extend lockdowns, first minister saysNew measures to control the spread of covid need to be given a chance to work, Mark Drakeford says.WalesComments","This video can not be played Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people not to down their drinks ahead of the new pub curfew There is ""no case"" for more areas to be locked down as new measures to control the rising Covid-19 rate need time to work, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford saidthe six south Wales counties already in lockdownwere the ""trigger point"" and efforts were being concentrated in those ""hotspot"" areas. New Wales-wide measures include early closing times and table service for pubs, cafes and restaurants. But lockdowns could be extended to new areas if necessary, he added. From Thursday at 18:00 BST, licensed premises must stop serving alcohol at 22:00 and off-licences and supermarkets must stop selling alcohol at the same time. He told BBC Breakfast: ""There was not yet a case for extending those [local lockdown] measures to other local authorities, but we would keep them under very close and daily review."" He said the two ""trigger points"" for taking more action in the south Wales counties not yet under lockdown would be a rise in case numbers and the positivity rate. Bridgend is one of six counties under lockdown after a spike in coronavirus cases People in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport and Blaenau Gwent are only allowed to enter or leave those counties for work, education, or a limited number of other essential reasons. Cardiff, Vale of Glamorgan, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire are on a watch-list for monitoring, and could face lockdown if cases rise. On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford announced a Â£500 payment to support people on low income who were asked to self-isolate. He also asked people to ""only travel when you need to do so"". He reiterated people needed to continue working from home wherever possible and wear face coverings on public transport, in shops and in enclosed public spaces. Mr Drakeford confirmed these measures at a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. This included clarifying the rule on pubs and restaurants to state that theyhad to stop serving alcohol at 22:00, rather than close completely, which he had said in the initial announcement on Tuesday evening. He denied stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 was a ""stab in the dark"", saying there was evidence from Wales' local lockdown areas that a ""small minority of people, late in the evening, when a lot of alcohol has been consumed, behave in ways that cause a risk to other people"". Speaking in the Senedd, he said: ""Our system will allow people to drink up, to eat up, to bring their evening to an orderly close and then make their way home."" 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Welsh universities set for 'different' freshers' week Rathlin Island: The UK island with no coronavirus cases He said there was a ""mixed picture"" about the spread of coronavirus across the country with higher levels in south Wales where lockdowns had been introduced. ""But further west, and in parts of north Wales, the rates are much lower,"" he added. He said people were being admitted to hospital needing treatment for the serious effects of coronavirus and - ""very sadly"" - in the last week, there were a number of deaths from coronavirus. Testing had seen a ""sharp rise"" in demand - 70,000 last week compared to 64,000 the week before, the highest number of tests processed so far in one week. He also told the briefing there was ""no evidence"" that visitors coming into Wales had led to spikes in infections. ""Coronavirus remains at its lowest levels in the holiday areas of Wales. The visitors we have had so far have been people who have acted responsibly and helped us to keep Wales safe."" Mr Drakeford said there was emerging evidence in Caerphilly, the first area to go into local lockdown, that enhanced measures to control the virus were working. ""Recent days have been encouraging. The numbers in Caerphilly have been coming down quite steadily over the last three or four days. ""We will need another couple of days to make sure that that is a sustained trend. ""My aim will be, if we are seeing a reliable improvement in Caerphilly, to begin to restore to people some of the freedoms we've had to withdraw from them."" Mr Drakeford said: ""If [people] act together in that sense of social solidarity, it is still possible to turn the tide on this."" Asked about Christmas get-togethers, he said: ""We will do everything we can and work as hard as we can so that people in Wales will still be able to meet their families, I'm afraid in this more restricted way, come December. ""That fight is still on by government doing what we can, our partners in the local authorities, health authorities and police, but most of all by each one of us in our own lives doing those simple things that we know add up to making the real difference. ""In that way come December we will still be able to get together with those people that mean the most to us and celebrate Christmas."" Mr Drakeford also told the Today programme that, despite the call for essential travel only, it was still ""very possible"" for people in Wales to have a holiday ""without travelling very far at all"". ""So people have got to make those decisions in their own circumstances, so we're not saying 'no holidays' to people,"" he said. ""But just think carefully, avoid unnecessary travel."" Trecco Bay holiday park is one of the UK's largest On Tuesday afternoon, Trecco Bay holiday park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, announced it was closing at 18:00 BST, giving people just hours to pack up and leave the site. The site was fully occupied, meaning about 4,000 people had to leave the same afternoon. Steve Richards, chief executive of Parkdean, which runs the park, said he had taken the decision because of the local lockdown coming into force in Bridgend, but added such resorts were generally in rural, coastal settings with a much lower density of people than typical town centres. ""This closure will affect many businesses and jobs in Porthcawl who rely on the regular influx of tourists to the area and, of course it will mean many hard-working Welsh people who account for over 90% of our guests, will now not be able to enjoy a well-earned break,"" he said. ""We're gutted to leave"", said Keith Evans Among those forced to leave was Keith and Iris Evans of Cimla, Neath, who were only given a few hours to pack up, having been on site since mid-July. ""We're gutted to leave. It's so relaxing here and there's a real community among the owners. ""We were told at 2:45pm that because of lockdown in Bridgend we had to be out by 6pm, but we couldn't. A lot of people didn't like it but they've had to accept it."" Campsite owner Thomas Beynon said there is confusion over travelling to take a holiday Thomas Beynon, owner of Three Cliffs campsite, Gower, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over non-essential travel. ""They [the Welsh Government] have not gone as far as to ask us not to open, but that's what the public has taken it as,"" he said. ""I've had 20 emails today asking are we still open. We're a seasonal business and have missed key parts of the year, [so] September and October could make a big difference. The country can't afford a full lockdown again."" People travelling on motorways through lockdown areasare still allowed to stop at service stations,external, so Sarn services in Bridgend is unaffected by the rule preventing people from outside the county stopping during their journey within its borders. The six counties hit with the lockdown restrictions all adjoin one another in south east Wales At present, the number of people allowed to attend a wedding is 30 - this figure has been cut in half in England. Mr Drakeford said discussions would take place later on whether the number should be reduced. If there was no evidence that numbers at weddings have led to spikes in the virus ""then I think that will point us in the opposite direction,"" he said. Analysis from the BBC shows in the seven days to 19 September, which is the most recent date accurate, updated statistics are available for, Merthyr Tydfil had the 13th highest case rate per 100,000 people in the UK, at 147.5. It was followed by Rhondda Cynon Taf at 136.8 cases per 100,000, with Blaenau Gwent on 94.5, Bridgend on 78.9, Caerphilly on 77.8 and Newport on 57.5. The figures are all higher than those shown by Public Health Wales because it takes a while for test results to come in and be backdated properly. Opposition members criticised the first minister for how he made the announcement on Tuesday - in a broadcast message,rather than in the Senedd. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said: ""I think it always helps if we can have a UK-wide approach to these things. That has been possible, probably eight times out of 10. ""There are numerous meetings and discussions with our colleagues in Cardiff to try and come up with solutions which don't damage the economy. At the same time, protect public health and deal with this very, very difficult virus."" Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, told the Senedd that the announcement was ""seemingly at odds"" with advice given to ministers that stated ""an earlier and more comprehensive response can prevent extended lockdowns"". He called for the Welsh Government to go further and introduce the temporary, or at least earlier, closure of pubs and clubs in areas under local lockdown, and stop the sale of alcohol at off-licences much earlier in those areas at 18:00 or 19:00. Brexit Party Member of the Senedd Mandy Jones criticised the first minister over his travel advice. ""The first minister has now said that people can still holiday in Wales, while repeating the line that they should only travel if essential. The lack of clarity is very troubling,"" she said. The changes announced on Tuesdayare in addition to the local lockdown restrictions. Public Health Wales figures reported 281 further cases of coronavirus on Tuesday,the highest number of cases since April. 'Don't race' to drink up before new pub curfew.

"Starmer refuses to rule out backing indyref2But the Labour leader says another ""divisive"" vote on Scotland's position in the near future is ""not needed"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Keir Starmer says he would not âbe doing a hypothetical for what would happen after Mayâ. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out the possibility of supporting a second referendum on Scottish independence in the long term. But he told the BBC a vote like the one held in 2014 was ""not needed"" soon and the focus should be on ""rebuilding"" the economy and services after coronavirus. His party would not campaign for a referendum in next May's Scottish Parliament elections, he added. The SNP government in Scotland wants to hold one as soon as possible. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Sir Keir also said Labour would ""betray"" voters ""if we don't take more seriously winning elections and actually changing lives"". And he argued Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not have ""the right character"" to deal with the challenges posed by the pandemic. Kuenssberg: How long can Starmer play the waiting game? Indyref2 plans to be published in draft bill Get serious about winning, Starmer tells Labour When Scotland's voters were asked in a referendum in 2014 whether the country should become independent, 55% said no. But the SNP has campaigned for a second poll since the UK's 2016 decision - in the Brexit referendum - to leave the EU. It says the difference between the UK-wide result and that in Scotland -which chose by 62% to 38%to remain within the bloc - strengthens the case for independence. It has also been suggested that, following the next UK general election, expected in 2024, Labour could need the support of the SNP if it wants to form a government. This might, it is added, require a deal on having another referendum. Sir Keir said: ""We will be going into that election in May making it very clear that another divisive referendum on independence in Scotland is not what is needed. ""What is needed is an intense focus on rebuilding the economy, on making sure public services are rebuilt as well and dealing with the pandemic."" Pressed on what would happen after May, Sir Keir said: ""We don't know... In politics, people tell you with great certainty what is going to happen next year and the year after, but it doesn't always turn out that way."" He added: ""I am setting out the argument we will make into May. I am not doing a hypothetical of what will happen after that."" The Scottish government, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, had hoped to hold an independence referendum during the current term of the Scottish Parliament. However, ministers wanted to secure an agreement with the UK government to make sure any vote would be legally watertight, something Mr Johnson has repeatedly stated his opposition to. Work on preparations for a ballot was paused after coronavirus hit, but the Scottish government has promised to set out plans in a draft bill. Labour, once dominant in Scotland, currently has23 Members of the Scottish Parliament,,externalputting it third behind the SNP, on 61, and the Conservatives, on 31. Speaking for the UK government, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove raised doubts about the Labour leader's comments, saying: ""Sir Keir Starmer has a problem accepting referendum results. ""He tried to block Brexit, and now he wants to work with Nicola Sturgeon to renege on the Scottish referendum result and break up the UK."" Sir Keir replaced Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in April, following the party's worst general election result - in terms of seats - since 1935. Recent UK opinion polls have suggested support for the party under his stewardship is now close to that for Mr Johnson's Conservatives. But some trade unions, including Unite and the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), have raised concerns over Sir Keir's leadership. The FBU has warned him not to ""water down"" pledges on workers' rights and the environment that he made when running for the job. In his speech on Monday to Labour's annual conference, Sir Keir told his party to ""get serious about winning"". Speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, he said: ""When you lose four elections in a row, you have lost the chance to change lives for the better and we have gifted the Tories a decade or more of power. That is not what the Labour Party is there for."" He also said: ""The Labour Party's historic mission was to represent working people in Parliament and to form governments to change lives, and we betray that if we don't take more seriously winning elections and actually changing lives.""

Hollywood star Reynolds in Wrexham bid,"Ryan Reynolds, whose film credits include The Change-Up, is also a successful entrepreneur, while Rob McElhenney has appeared in Fargo Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are interested in investing in Wrexham, the club have announced. Deadpool and Detective Pikachu star Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's McElhenney will share their vision for the club with members at a special general meeting (SGM). The fan-owned club's members have voted overwhelmingly for talks to proceed. Any potential takeover could lead to Â£2m being invested in the club, which has been in fan ownership since 2011. A total of 1,223 Wrexham Supporters Trust members - over 95% of those asked - voted for the move and 31 against at a special general meeting on Tuesday. Ryan Reynolds sent this tweet an hour after the news broke Trust director Spencer Harris, who expects a further vote from fans on the outline of the deal ""in weeks rather than months"", told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the deal is in its early stages, but he has known the identity of the would-be backers for some time. ""We've known for a little while, but we wanted to come as early as we could in the process to involve supporters,"" Harristold the programme. ""As everybody knows we are community owned and therefore this has become public knowledge a little bit earlier than it would in any other normal circumstance, but yeah it's out there now so people know all about it. ""We started talking through representatives of theirs, talking about the club, and we're now in a position where we are able, following the SGM on Tuesday night, to get into detailed discussions about what a takeover deal could look like. ""There is some way to go and at the end of the day it will be the supporters who decide what the future direction of the club will be."" Mr Reynolds, who was among the world's highest paid actors this year after appearing in the Netflix films 6 Underground and Red Notice, has been a shareholder in Aviation American Gin since 2018. In August 2020 drinks giant Diageobought Aviation American, along with three other spirits, as part of a $610m (Â£460m) deal. Harris has been impressed by their enthusiasm and approach to a possible takeover of the National League club. ""I've spoken to both of them several times,"" Harris explained. ""They are very serious, professional and successful people, not just as actors but in the business world as well and this is a very serious endeavour for them and they'll set out their vision in due course, but I know they are very passionate about this and have gone into a lot of depth to understand about the football club."" So far it is unclear why the Hollywood 'A-listers' are interested in a fifth-tier UK football club in north Wales. ""I think that's a question for them in good time,"" said Harris. ""I would answer 'why not?', because for us as Wrexham fans we are the third oldest professional team in the world, the oldest in Wales and play at the oldest international stadium anywhere in the world. ""We are a team with a proud history that's beaten Porto in the European Cup Winners Cup and there's lot's of potential at the club, so why not?"" ""But... I don't want to get in front of them setting out their vision for the club which they will do in due course."" Approval from members for a deal would see the Trust relinquish control of running the club. ""It's very exciting news for a lot of people, but supporters will make a decision on whether this goes forward or not,"" explained Harris. ""Of course I would imagine we would see them at the Racecourse and we may have done already had it not been for Covid-19. ""It's a difficult time for all of football, not just at our level, even clubs at Premier League level are taking significant loans from government. ""We are in a relatively decent position versus many so there's no particular burning platform at the football club as we speak right now, however investment into any football club, especially at this level, does make quite some difference and obviously these are very serious professionals, successful people who I'm sure would have a lot to bring to any business.""

LiveLive'Outrage' in US over Breonna Taylor charges1 minute ago,"A grand jury has charged a former police officer after a fatal raid killed a black woman Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor was killed in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, during the police raid in March Brett Hankison is charged with three counts of wanton endangerment but not in relation to her death The charges relate to shots he fired that entered Ms Taylor's neighbours' apartments Her death became a rallying cry for anti-racism protesters They demanded all three officers involved in the raid be arrested and charged Kentucky's top lawyer says the shots fired by the other officers were 'justified to protect themselves' We're pausing our live coverage of the reaction to the Kentucky grand jury's decision in the Breonna Taylor case. You can still follow updates to the story here. Here are the key takeaways: Today's coverage was brought to you by Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Vicky Baker. This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: 'There's a lot of disappointment here' If you're just joining us, here are some of the new details you may have missed from Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's briefing earlier. The attorney general revealed thatthe investigation concluded police did not actually carry out a ""no-knock warrant""(which lets police enter without warning). Mr Cameron said police had knocked and announced themselves. This goes against what we've heard from some other witnesses thus far. He also said that a ballistics report from the FBI found thatDetective Myles Cosgrove fired the fatal shot that killed Ms Taylor.A total of 32 shots were fired by police (16 by Mr Cosgrove, six by Mr Mattingly and 10 by Mr Hankinson). The investigation also confirmed thatKenneth Walker, Ms Taylor's boyfriend, fired the shot that hit Mr Mattingly. Ms Taylor was hit by six shots, not the five listed in her death certificate. Mr Cameron said that the investigators found a sixth bullet or fragment in her foot. This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: Protests in Louisville after grand jury decision It's not just Louisville that is preparing for a night of protests. The governor of neighbouring Illinois has also told the National Guard to be prepared to deploy in case protests there turn violent. Major protests have also been planned for New York and Los Angeles later today. Demonstrators in Louisville, Kentucky Almost as soon as the charge was announced in the state capital of Frankfort, protesters gathered in Louisville began chanting ""no justice, no peace"". ""That's it?"" some declared as they learned of the charge, and the news that the officer would only be required to post a $15,000 (Â£11,800) bail to go free as he awaits trial. Since then they have been marching through the city shouting Breonna Taylor's name. Some have been in tears, telling reporters that the officer ""got away"" with murder. The crowd has been growing and some neighbours have been seen opening their doors to cheer the protesters, according to CNN. President Trump - who has been at a discussion with State Attorneys General at the White House - was asked by a reporter about what his message is to the black community in light of the Taylor ruling. ""My message is that I love the black community and I've done more for the black community than any other president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln,"" he said, citing his administration's work with opportunity zones (tax incentives to encourage investment in lower-income areas), criminal justice reform, prison reform and historically black schools. Abraham Lincoln was the president who ended slavery in the US and led the country during the Civil War. ""Abraham Lincoln, let's give him the nod but beyond that nobody's done more,"" Mr Trump continued. He then added that he just heard a decision had been made but was not aware of the details. ""After I see what the decision is I will have a comment on it."" A lawyer for two of the officers who fired into Ms Taylor's apartment has praised the grand jury's decision not to charge his clients with any crime related to Ms Taylor's death. ""The death of Breonna Taylor is a tragedy,"" lawyer Kent Wicker wrote in a statement. ""But these officers did not act in a reckless or unprofessional manner. They did their duty, performed their roles as law enforcement officers and, above all, did not break the law."" ""The system worked,"" he added about his clients, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove. Earlier, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron told reporters that ""the use of force by Mattingly and Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves"". ""This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylorâs death.â Many human and civil rights organisations across the US are unhappy with today's decision. Here's a flavour of what advocates are saying on social media. The American Civil Liberties Union,externalsaid: ""Justice would have been [Louisville police] officers never shooting Breonna Taylor in the first place."" ""This decision highlights what we already knew: To stop the perpetuation of egregious violence against Black people, elected officials MUST listen to the cries of our communities."" Amnesty International USA,externalsenior officer Kristina Roth called on local police to meet their obligation to allow for peaceful protest in the wake of this case. ""Breonna Taylorâs case reminds us of how Kentuckyâs police use of lethal force statute puts accountability out of reach for unlawful killings by police  â and how police, who are supposed to protect life, so frequently only see one side of that principle."" This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: Kentucky attorney general presents grand jury findings Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has presented the grand jury findings in the case of Breonna Taylor. Brett Hankison is charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, but not in relation to the 26-year-old's death. Read more: Breonna Taylor officer charged but not over death The decision to charge Brett Hankinson for wanton endangerment was made by a Kentucky grand jury. But what exactly is a grand jury? A grand jury is an impartial group of citizens who are presented with evidence and asked to vote in secret on whether or not to charge a suspect with a crime. The jury found the other two officers were justified in their use of force, according to the Kentucky attorney general, because they had come under fire from Ms Taylor's boyfriend. The attorney general refused to comment on the racial makeup of the grand jury in his press conference, due to confidentiality laws. Kentucky National Guard troops have been deployed around the city of Louisville as the city braces for potential civil unrest. The deployment is seen as controversial, because National Guard troops killed a black restaurant owner during earlier Black Lives Matter protesters in June. That shooting led to the firing of the city's police chief after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family of Breonna Taylor as well as the families of other black Americans killed by police, has tweeted his angry reaction to the news that only one officer involved in Ms Taylor's death is being charged. Mr Crump said the fired police officer, Brett Hankinson, is being charged for ""bullets that went into other apartments"" not Ms Taylor's. He adds that the charges include ""NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor"". ""This is outrageous and offensive!"" he adds. ""If Brett Hankison's behaviour was wanton endangerment to people in neighbouring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor's apartment too. ""In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder!"" A mural of Ms Taylor in Annapolis, Maryland, seen from a drone Ms Taylor was killed two months before the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, which triggered worldwide protests against police brutality and racism. Protesters said her case had been overlooked and her name and face started to feature prominently at related demonstrations throughout the US summer. Here are some images from those earlier sweeping protests. Last week, Ms Taylor's mother said that if her daughter was not killed by police, she would be out in the streets walking with the Black Lives Matter protesters. Protesters have demanded that the public ""say her name"" so she is not forgotten Hundreds of protesters in New York's Times Square in August shouted her name Ms Taylor was an emergency medical worker, who was killed amid the coronavirus pandemic The Women's National Basketball Association has dedicated their basketball season to Ms Taylor Mr Cameron's final question of the day is about meeting with Ms Taylor's family to inform them about the decision today. ""It was a hard meeting and I won't go any further, I won't elaborate but it was a difficult meeting."" He says that it's impossible to know what challenges you will face when you take office. ""And today was one of those challenges to have to sit in that room and provide the information to Ms Palmer and to other members of the Taylor family. It's been a difficult day."" He calls for people to respect the community, be good neighbours, and responsibly practice their right to free speech today. That concludes his news briefing. Mr Cameron has answered many of the questions regarding the grand jury's decision and what they heard by saying: ""Testimony was heard by the grand jury of all sorts of witnesses, and folks, again, all relevant info was provided to the grand jury."" He says because the prosecution is ongoing, the office won't release any files or other details about what the grand jury received. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron addressing the Republican National Convention in August Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky Attorney General who is speaking live from the state capitol in Frankfort, is the first black man in the state's history to hold the role. The 34-year-old Republican prosecutor is seen as a rising star in the party, and spoke at President Donald Trump's nominating convention last month. Speaking at the Republican convention about racial justice protesters, he said: ""Even as anarchists mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police and innocent bystanders, we Republicans do recognise those who work in good faith towards peace, justice and equality."" During his remarks in Frankfort, he warned protesters to remain peaceful in light of today's announcement or risk arrest and prosecution. Mr Cameron says he understands the pain that Ms Taylor's death has caused. ""I understand that as an Attorney General who is responsible for all 120 counties... I understand that as a black man. How painful this is."" Mr Cameron says this is why it was ""incredibly important"" to his team to ""uncover every fact"". He says that the criticism and scrutiny on his office was ""misplaced"". ""There was not a day that people in this office didn't go to sleep without thinking about this case. ""Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief and that is true here."" Mr Cameron, pausing a moment as he speaks, also says that if something like this were to happen to him, his mother ""would find it very hard"". ""I've seen that pain on Ms Palmer's face,"" he says, referencing Ms Taylor's mother. ""I've seen that pain in the community."" Breonna Taylor was an emergency room technician As the attorney general continues to field reporter questions, let's take a step back and look at what happened that night in March. Ms Taylor was at home in Louisville on 13 March when police officers entered her apartment shortly after midnight, her family says. Narcotics officers raided her home and used a battering ram to take her front door off its hinges. No drugs were found on her property and Ms Taylor had no criminal record. At the time, Ms Taylor was in bed with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, according to her family. Hearing the commotion, Mr Walker believed people were trying to break into the apartment and he later told police he fired one shot of his pistol. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. Mr Mattingly and two other officers, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove, returned fire and shot more than 20 rounds. Mr Walker wasn't wounded but Ms Taylor was hit multiple times and died in the hallway of her apartment. Mr Cameron is asked: why wasn't this a manslaughter charge, given the fact that Ms Taylor died? He says: ""It's important to step back and recognise that what we did was uncover all the information and facts, and then provided that information to the grand jury. ""The grand jury had every piece of detail needed to make their assessment and judgment and ultimately their conclusion was that the decision needed to be made to indict Mr Hankinson."" Breonna Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said earlier this month that she wanted all three officers arrested and charged with murder. Her lawyers asked for manslaughter charges at least, which come in cases where a person's death comes as a result of a perpetrator's violent actions but is not intentional. Ms Palmer's comments came last week, when she won a $12m settlement from the city that included a raft of police reforms, including an end to no-knock warrants.

Breonna Taylor officer charged but not over deathBrett Hankison fired 10 rounds into her apartment and is accused of endangering her neighbours.,"This video can not be played Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented the grand jury decision A police officer has been charged over the narcotics raid that resulted in the fatal shooting of a black woman at her home in the US state of Kentucky. Breonna Taylor, 26, a hospital worker, was shot multiple times as officers stormed her home on 13 March. Brett Hankison has been charged, not with Ms Taylor's death, but with ""wanton endangerment"" for firing into a neighbour's apartment in Louisville. Two other officers who were involved have not been charged. Under Kentucky law, someone is guilty of wanton endangerment if they commit an act that shows ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". This lowest-level felony offence can come with a five-year sentence for each count. Mr Hankison was charged on three counts. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of US police killings Ms Taylor's relatives and activists for whom her death has become a rallying cry had been calling for the three officers, who are all white, to be charged with murder or manslaughter. But this was rejected by a grand jury that reviewed the evidence. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died On Wednesday, Judge Annie O'Connell announced the charges that had been brought by a grand jury against Mr Hankison. Kentucky Attorney General Mr Cameron then held a news conference in which he expanded on the decision. ""This is a gut-wrenching emotional case,"" he said. ""There is nothing I can offer them today to take away the grief and heartache as a result of losing a child, a niece, a sister and a friend,"" he added in a message to Ms Taylor's family. Mr Cameron said a ballistics report had found that six bullets struck Ms Taylor, but only one was fatal. That analysis concluded that Detective Myles Cosgrove had fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. The attorney general said it was not clear if Mr Hankison's shots had hit Ms Taylor, but they had hit a neighbouring apartment. This video can not be played Protesters march in Louisville following the grand jury decision The top prosecutor said the other two officers - Jonathan Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove - had been ""justified to protect themselves and the justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges"". Mr Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first black attorney general, added: ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. ""Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge."" He added that the FBI was still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. The National Guard were deployed in Louisville ahead of the announcement Ben Crump, a high-profile lawyer for the Taylor family, said the outcome was ""outrageous and offensive"". Officials this month agreed to pay her family $12m (Â£9.3m) in a settlement. Asked for his reaction to the decision, Mr Trump told a White House news conference: ""I thought it was really brilliant."" He praised Kentucky's attorney general, who addressed the Republican party convention last month, for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""I think he's a star,"" he said, adding that he approved of the Kentucky governor's decision to send in the National Guard. Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Kentucky prosecutors to release the evidence that was presented to the grand jury. ""I think having more of the facts out there so people can see, people can truly process it, is where we need to be,"" Mr Beshear told reporters. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville on Tuesday and protests are expected. The National Guard have also been deployed. Mayor Greg Fischer has set a 21:00-06:30 curfew in the city that will remain in place for the next 72 hours. He earlier said he had declared a state of emergency ""due to the potential for civil unrest"". Police have closed traffic on certain streets where protests have been prevalent, and barricades have been erected around the city centre. Demonstrations over Ms Taylor's death have been held in the city for more than 100 consecutive days. The National Guard deployment has been criticised because one of its troops fatally shot a black restaurant owner, David McAtee, as authorities dispersed Black Lives Matter protesters in June. The police department said its officers had come under fire while they were trying to clear the area. But after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras, the city's police chief was sacked. Shortly after midnight on Friday 13 March, she was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when they heard a banging on the door. Plainclothes Louisville police officers were carrying out a narcotics raid, and they used a battering ram to enter the property. A judge had granted a warrant to search Ms Taylor's home because investigators suspected a convicted drug dealer - her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover - was using the address to receive packages. She had no criminal record. Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, later told police he thought the late-night intruder was Glover, according to the New York Times. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI. The death of Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor, who had also got out of bed amid the commotion, was shot and died on the hallway floor. According to an arrest report, the officers had been granted a ""no-knock"" warrant, allowing them to enter the property without warning. But Mr Cameron said on Wednesday the officers had not actually served such a warrant. The attorney general said the officers' statements that they identified themselves ""are corroborated by an independent witness"". Some neighbours told local media they did not hear the officers announce themselves. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County prosecutor Thomas Wine has previously said the search was cancelled after the shooting. The subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Ms Taylor's injuries as ""none"" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used. Mr Walker was initially charged with attempted murder and assault of a police officer, but the case against him was dropped in May amid national scrutiny of the case. From left: Brett Hankison, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove Mr Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after investigators found he had ""wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds"" during the raid, according to his termination letter. Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties. The Louisville Courier-Journal has reported that six officers are under internal police review for their role in the shooting. Seven solutions to US police problems Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Mr Mattingly wrote an email on Saturday to more than 1,000 colleagues in which he criticised city leaders and protesters. ""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,"" he wrote in the message, which was published by media outlets on Tuesday. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonised, and the criminals are canonised."" ""Your civil rights mean nothing,"" he added, ""but the criminal has total autonomy."" Are you in Louisville?

Deadpool and Detective Pikachu star Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's McElhenney will share their vision for the club with members at a special general meeting (SGM). The fan-owned club's members have voted overwhelmingly for talks to proceed. Any potential takeover could lead to Â£2m being invested in the club, which has been in fan ownership since 2011. A total of 1,223 Wrexham Supporters Trust members - over 95% of those asked - voted for the move and 31 against at a special general meeting on Tuesday. Ryan Reynolds sent this tweet an hour after the news broke Trust director Spencer Harris, who expects a further vote from fans on the outline of the deal ""in weeks rather than months"", told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the deal is in its early stages, but he has known the identity of the would-be backers for some time.

Harry urges US voters to 'reject hate speech',"Prince Harry has urged US citizens to ""reject hate speech"" and vote in the country's upcoming presidential election. He made the remarks alongside his wife, Meghan, in a US television broadcast. A spokesperson for the couple said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead ""a call for decency"". Voting for the next US president, with candidates including Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, is on 3 November. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Prince Harry repays cottage renovation cost No other option but to step back, says Harry The Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in a live video in what appeared to be their California home as part of the Time 100 - a list compiled by Time magazine to celebrate the world's most influential people. It was their first joint TV appearance since theyceased being working members of the Royal Family in March. ""As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,"" the duke said as he sat on a bench alongside Meghan. He also reminded Americans to be discerning in the content they consumed online. ""When the bad outweighs the good, for many, whether we realise it or not, it erodes our ability to have compassion and our ability to put ourself in someone else's shoes,"" he said. ""Because when one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act."" The 36-year-old duke said he would not be voting in the election because he was not a US citizen, adding that he had never voted in UK elections either. Members of the Royal Family traditionally do not vote, and the Queen is politically neutral. Although UK law does not ban royalty from voting, it is considered unconstitutional for them to do so. Harry and Meghan stepped aside from their roles as senior working royals in March in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family. By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent When Harry and Meghan ceased to be working royals back in March, the official ""divorce"" statement read: ""While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty."" It is Harry's contribution to the Time video message which seems to have attracted the most comment. His spokesman is clear that the duke was making a ""non-partisan call for decency"". But with the Trump administration commonly accused of the traits called out by Harry - ""hate speech, misinformation and online negativity""- his contribution has been widely interpreted as party political. The expectation is that royals remain neutral and the question troubling many people today is whether that means Harry's words are incompatible with the statement issued by the palace in March. It was always going to be difficult to work a way through their royal/non-royal status to the satisfaction of the Sussexes and the Royal Family, as this latest episode once again makes clear. Reacting to the couple's remarks, Royal biographer Robert Jobson said: ""They are not carrying out public duties, live abroad and are really completely detached from our monarchical system now so what difference would it make? ""Meghan, after all, holds American citizenship and has always voted. The business about royals not getting involved in politics is less clear when it comes to Meghan or what the protocol should be in this case. ""But as she is now back living in her country I am sure many would think it wrong that she is not allowed to exercise her democratic right to vote."" However, Mr Jobson said ""it would be better"" for Prince Harry to withdraw from the line of succession ""to avoid further confusion"". And if they were to leave their royal titles behind it may set the duchess ""free to pursue a political career,"" he added. But former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said Prince Harry should not have remarked on the US election as he is still a ""representative"" of the UK. There was ""no problem"" with a ""private citizen"" expressing their views, he said, ""the problem is Harry still has his HRH status"". ""He wants his foot in both camps,"" said the author of the book And What Do You Do? What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know. The duchess, who mocked then-Republican candidate Mr Trump during a 2016 television appearance, said in the video that the November poll was the ""most important election of our lifetime"". ""When we vote, our values are put into action and our voices are heard. Your voice is a reminder that you matter, because you do and you deserve to be heard,"" she said. A spokesperson for the couple said: ""His message is not in reference to any specific political party or candidate, but is instead a call for decency in how we engage with each other, interact, and consume information - especially online."" A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: ""We would not comment. The duke is not a working member of the Royal Family and any comments he makes are made in a personal capacity.""

Asda to crack down on shoppers without face masks,"Supermarket Asda is set to enforce rules on face coverings more strictly across its shops amid the pandemic. Customers who do not have a covering when they enter a store will be offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for at the end of their trip. ""We know that safety remains a key priority for our customers,"" its chief operating officer said. Face coverings must be worn by customers in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres around the UK. Those who fail to do so can be fined by the police - up to Â£100 in England (soon to rise to Â£200), or Â£60 in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? Making shoppers wear masks could 'trigger abuse', warn unions Asda announced on Wednesday that it will create 1,000 new ""safety marshal"" roles across its 639 UK stores. Dedicated staff will remind shoppers to wear face coverings in-store and provide customers with sanitised shopping baskets on arrival. The supermarket chain said it will also install extra hand sanitiser stations in the busiest sections of its shops. Anthony Hemmerdinger, chief operating officer at Asda, said: ""We know that safety remains a key priority for our customers and we will continue to do all we can to keep them and our colleagues safe in store, as we have since the start of the pandemic. ""These additional measures will make our stores an even safer place to shop and work during the coming months."" Following a recent change in government guidance, face coverings are now also compulsory for shop workers in England. Asda confirmed all of its staff across England, Wales and Scotland will now wear a covering while at work - unless they have a medical exemption. Asda's announcement on Wednesday followed on from the news that Morrisons has reinstated marshals on the doors of its 497 supermarkets to better monitor shopper numbers and remind those entering to wear a face covering. Morrisons has reinstated marshals to better monitor customer numbers Morrisons has also created 2,420 new cleaning roles across its shops. Each one of its supermarkets will also undergo a ""deep clean"" every three weeks. Jayne Wall, operations director at Morrisons said: ""The hygiene within our stores has become more important than ever due to the impact of Covid-19. ""We want to make sure our customers feel as safe as possible when doing their grocery shopping with us. So we've made this multi-million-pound investment to introduce first-class hygiene procedures."" Some industry figures have warned, however, that staff enforcing rules on face coverings may be subject to abuse from customers. Trade union Usdaw called on shoppers to ""respect retail workers and follow the necessary in-store safety measures to keep us all safe"". General secretary Paddy Lillis said: ""We are deeply worried about safety measures not being followed and the impact that has on the safety of staff. ""Usdaw members in food retail are key workers delivering an essential service and have worked extremely hard in stressful environments to ensure that the nation remains fed. ""Despite this, during the height of the first wave of the outbreak, violence and abuse toward shop staff doubled. It is clear that such behaviour is unacceptable: abuse is not part of the job."" At the height of the pandemic, abuse of retail staff doubled, says trade union Usdaw Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Retailers are working hard to keep their customers and staff safe throughout this pandemic. They have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on coronavirus safety measures including perspex screens, social distancing measures and additional hygiene measures. ""Retailers support all necessary safety measures including the use of face coverings for all staff."" In March, UK supermarkets were forced to take steps to prevent shoppers from panic-buying around the height of the pandemic. Many introduced limits on the number of certain items that customers could buy, such as flour, pasta or toilet roll. Enhanced measures introduced in recent weeks have not triggered stock-piling by customers, according to several supermarkets approached by the BBC. Asda said it still had good availability in-store and online, while Tesco - the UK's largest grocer - is not experiencing any product shortages either. Waitrose said it had ""good levels"" of stock and that it had also looked at the items people bought early in lockdown and planned ahead accordingly. ""We would like to reassure customers that there is no need to worry about buying more than they need,"" a spokesperson said. An Iceland spokesperson said: ""There are no shortages and there will be no shortages so long as people continue to shop responsibly for what they actually need.""

Uncle Ben's changes name to more 'equitable' brand,"Uncle Ben's Rice will change its name to Ben's Original and remove the image of a smiling, grey-haired black man from its packaging. The change follows through on a pledge its owner Mars Food made in June to review the brand amid global protests over police brutality and racism. Uncle Ben's entered the market in the 1940s and was for decades the best-selling rice in the US. Its marketing has been criticised for perpetuating racial stereotypes. Titles such as uncle and aunt were used in southern US states to refer to black people, instead of the more formal and respectful ""Miss"" or ""Mister"". The name Uncle Ben's was supposedly inspired by a Texas farmer known for his high-quality rice. The company asked the head waiter at a fancy Chicago restaurant, Frank Brown, to pose as the face of the brand, which launched in 1947. In 2007, the company sought to update its marketing with a campaign that cast Ben as chairman of the board, a move away from the previous, more servile presentation. ""We understand the inequities that were associated with the name and face of the previous brand, and as we announced in June, we have committed to change,"" Mars said. The new packaging is expected to begin reaching shops in 2021. Mars said it would also work with the National Urban League in the US to support black chefs with a $2m donation toward scholarships and invest $2.5m in Greenville, Mississippi, where the rice is made. ""The brand is not just changing its name and image on the package. It is also taking action to enhance inclusion and equity and setting out its new brand purpose to create opportunities that offer everyone a seat at the table,"" the company said. Mars was one of several food giants that promised to review brands in the wake of the protests triggered by George Floyd's death. Earlier this year, Pepsi said it would overhaul the marketing for its popularAunt Jemimaline of syrups and foods, acknowledging the brand was based on a racial stereotype.

University Covid clusters involve 124 students,"Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow A major outbreak of Covid-19 at Glasgow University has led to 172 students testing positive. The university said the actual number of infected students was ""likely to be higher"", and added that 600 people were self-isolating. Details emerged as Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was ""very concerned"" about outbreaks at  several universities. They include Abertay in Dundee and the University of Aberdeen. The clusters in Glasgow are centred on two halls of residence in the city. The university said they involved the Murano Street and Cairncross residences, and were largely due to social activity at the start of Freshers Week, from 12-14 September. In a statement it said: ""The total number of reported cases since the start of term is 124 but the actual number is likely to be higher. ""Over 600 students are isolating across all residences.  We are not aware of any students who have had to receive hospital treatment."" The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland The statement added that those students affected had access to food and other supplies. Advice on medical issues including mental health and wellbeing was also being made available. The Murano Street Student Village is the largest residence at University of Glasgow, with more than 1,100 student bedrooms. In total, about 2,500 spaces are available in seven residences for students at the city's universities. The university said any students found to be breaking the rules faced disciplinary action including termination of their accommodation contracts and suspension from the university. A mobile testing centre will be set up at Murano and student unions will be closed this weekend. The Glasgow outbreak is one of a number linked to student residences across Scotland. All 500 residents atParker House in Dundee have been asked to self-isolateuntil contact tracing is complete after three confirmed coronavirus cases at Abertay University. In Aberdeen, 72 residents at Hillhead student village are self-isolating after students tested positive. Aberdeen University has urged anyone who attended parties or other gatherings since Friday to come forward to aid contact tracing efforts, and promised that if they do so they will not be punished for breaching guidance. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" During Wednesday's daily coronavirus briefing, Prof Leitch described the Glasgow University outbreak as ""significant"" and issued a warning to students about attending house parties. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Thursday, he said: ""I am concerned, very concerned, about higher and further education, I always have been. ""Predictably, we have cases. Every country in the world that has brought universities back has got cases. ""We need to be very, very careful. Even though most of those cases will not get serious illness, some of them will and some of them will potentially spread it to the community."" Prof Leitch initially said students would be allowed to return to their family homes ""but they should think hard about that"". ""If you are not self-isolating and have no symptoms, you can go home for the holidays etc,"" he said. ""But we would ask you to think carefully about that. We don't want too much spread - particularly from high areas to low areas. ""So maybe not as often as you normally would, but it's not illegal."" However, he later tweeted to ""clarify"" that students and their families must adhere to the nationwide ban on household visits. Prof Leitch said: ""To clarify, they are a separate household. There are exceptions, eg caring responsibilities, but the law is clear: they can't meet indoors with another household - even mum and dad. Sorry."" UK health secretaryMatt Hancock has refused to rule out banning students from returning homeat Christmas. One student at Cairncross House told BBC Scotland she was asked to quarantine on Sunday - a week after arriving in the city. Under Scottish government guidelines, students in residences are assigned to ""households"" based on shared facilities such as kitchens. She said two people in her household of eight had tested positive for coronavirus. They are mainly reporting a loss of taste or smell, and a slight fever, she said. It appears to have spread through the residence in Freshers' Week, when students mixed with people outside their households. One of the clusters involves the Cairncross House accommodation ""I don't think people were being too wildly unsensible,"" the student said. ""People were mixing outside of their households because I mean it was Freshers Week, people weren't going to stay in their own kitchens and not do anything. ""But I don't think people were being too crazy. There haven't been massive parties."" She said they have been advised to wear masks when they leave their rooms to use shared kitchens, and to order supermarket deliveries. But she was able to continue her studies as all her classes are online. ""It's a bit strange,"" she said. ""It does get a bit hard to concentrate when you're sitting in your room from 9-5 and you can't go out for a walk to clear your head. ""At the same time, it's nice to have the work to occupy my time. But it's only day three, so it might get harder."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

LiveLiveUS reacts to Breonna Taylor charges4 minutes ago,"A grand jury has charged a former police officer after a fatal raid killed a black woman Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor was killed in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, during the police raid in March Brett Hankison is charged with three counts of wanton endangerment but not in relation to her death The charges relate to shots he fired that entered Ms Taylor's neighbours' apartments Her death became a rallying cry for anti-racism protesters They demanded all three officers involved in the raid be arrested and charged Kentucky's top lawyer says the shots fired by the other officers were 'justified to protect themselves' We're pausing our live coverage of the reaction to the Kentucky grand jury's decision in the Breonna Taylor case. You can still follow updates to the story here. Here are the key takeaways: Today's coverage was brought to you by Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Vicky Baker. This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: 'There's a lot of disappointment here' If you're just joining us, here are some of the new details you may have missed from Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's briefing earlier. The attorney general revealed thatthe investigation concluded police did not actually carry out a ""no-knock warrant""(which lets police enter without warning). Mr Cameron said police had knocked and announced themselves. This goes against what we've heard from some other witnesses thus far. He also said that a ballistics report from the FBI found thatDetective Myles Cosgrove fired the fatal shot that killed Ms Taylor.A total of 32 shots were fired by police (16 by Mr Cosgrove, six by Mr Mattingly and 10 by Mr Hankinson). The investigation also confirmed thatKenneth Walker, Ms Taylor's boyfriend, fired the shot that hit Mr Mattingly. Ms Taylor was hit by six shots, not the five listed in her death certificate. Mr Cameron said that the investigators found a sixth bullet or fragment in her foot. This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: Protests in Louisville after grand jury decision It's not just Louisville that is preparing for a night of protests. The governor of neighbouring Illinois has also told the National Guard to be prepared to deploy in case protests there turn violent. Major protests have also been planned for New York and Los Angeles later today. Demonstrators in Louisville, Kentucky Almost as soon as the charge was announced in the state capital of Frankfort, protesters gathered in Louisville began chanting ""no justice, no peace"". ""That's it?"" some declared as they learned of the charge, and the news that the officer would only be required to post a $15,000 (Â£11,800) bail to go free as he awaits trial. Since then they have been marching through the city shouting Breonna Taylor's name. Some have been in tears, telling reporters that the officer ""got away"" with murder. The crowd has been growing and some neighbours have been seen opening their doors to cheer the protesters, according to CNN. President Trump - who has been at a discussion with State Attorneys General at the White House - was asked by a reporter about what his message is to the black community in light of the Taylor ruling. ""My message is that I love the black community and I've done more for the black community than any other president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln,"" he said, citing his administration's work with opportunity zones (tax incentives to encourage investment in lower-income areas), criminal justice reform, prison reform and historically black schools. Abraham Lincoln was the president who ended slavery in the US and led the country during the Civil War. ""Abraham Lincoln, let's give him the nod but beyond that nobody's done more,"" Mr Trump continued. He then added that he just heard a decision had been made but was not aware of the details. ""After I see what the decision is I will have a comment on it."" A lawyer for two of the officers who fired into Ms Taylor's apartment has praised the grand jury's decision not to charge his clients with any crime related to Ms Taylor's death. ""The death of Breonna Taylor is a tragedy,"" lawyer Kent Wicker wrote in a statement. ""But these officers did not act in a reckless or unprofessional manner. They did their duty, performed their roles as law enforcement officers and, above all, did not break the law."" ""The system worked,"" he added about his clients, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove. Earlier, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron told reporters that ""the use of force by Mattingly and Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves"". ""This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylorâs death.â Many human and civil rights organisations across the US are unhappy with today's decision. Here's a flavour of what advocates are saying on social media. The American Civil Liberties Union,externalsaid: ""Justice would have been [Louisville police] officers never shooting Breonna Taylor in the first place."" ""This decision highlights what we already knew: To stop the perpetuation of egregious violence against Black people, elected officials MUST listen to the cries of our communities."" Amnesty International USA,externalsenior officer Kristina Roth called on local police to meet their obligation to allow for peaceful protest in the wake of this case. ""Breonna Taylorâs case reminds us of how Kentuckyâs police use of lethal force statute puts accountability out of reach for unlawful killings by police  â and how police, who are supposed to protect life, so frequently only see one side of that principle."" This video can not be played Breonna Taylor: Kentucky attorney general presents grand jury findings Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has presented the grand jury findings in the case of Breonna Taylor. Brett Hankison is charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, but not in relation to the 26-year-old's death. Read more: Breonna Taylor officer charged but not over death The decision to charge Brett Hankinson for wanton endangerment was made by a Kentucky grand jury. But what exactly is a grand jury? A grand jury is an impartial group of citizens who are presented with evidence and asked to vote in secret on whether or not to charge a suspect with a crime. The jury found the other two officers were justified in their use of force, according to the Kentucky attorney general, because they had come under fire from Ms Taylor's boyfriend. The attorney general refused to comment on the racial makeup of the grand jury in his press conference, due to confidentiality laws. Kentucky National Guard troops have been deployed around the city of Louisville as the city braces for potential civil unrest. The deployment is seen as controversial, because National Guard troops killed a black restaurant owner during earlier Black Lives Matter protesters in June. That shooting led to the firing of the city's police chief after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family of Breonna Taylor as well as the families of other black Americans killed by police, has tweeted his angry reaction to the news that only one officer involved in Ms Taylor's death is being charged. Mr Crump said the fired police officer, Brett Hankinson, is being charged for ""bullets that went into other apartments"" not Ms Taylor's. He adds that the charges include ""NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor"". ""This is outrageous and offensive!"" he adds. ""If Brett Hankison's behaviour was wanton endangerment to people in neighbouring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor's apartment too. ""In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder!"" A mural of Ms Taylor in Annapolis, Maryland, seen from a drone Ms Taylor was killed two months before the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, which triggered worldwide protests against police brutality and racism. Protesters said her case had been overlooked and her name and face started to feature prominently at related demonstrations throughout the US summer. Here are some images from those earlier sweeping protests. Last week, Ms Taylor's mother said that if her daughter was not killed by police, she would be out in the streets walking with the Black Lives Matter protesters. Protesters have demanded that the public ""say her name"" so she is not forgotten Hundreds of protesters in New York's Times Square in August shouted her name Ms Taylor was an emergency medical worker, who was killed amid the coronavirus pandemic The Women's National Basketball Association has dedicated their basketball season to Ms Taylor Mr Cameron's final question of the day is about meeting with Ms Taylor's family to inform them about the decision today. ""It was a hard meeting and I won't go any further, I won't elaborate but it was a difficult meeting."" He says that it's impossible to know what challenges you will face when you take office. ""And today was one of those challenges to have to sit in that room and provide the information to Ms Palmer and to other members of the Taylor family. It's been a difficult day."" He calls for people to respect the community, be good neighbours, and responsibly practice their right to free speech today. That concludes his news briefing. Mr Cameron has answered many of the questions regarding the grand jury's decision and what they heard by saying: ""Testimony was heard by the grand jury of all sorts of witnesses, and folks, again, all relevant info was provided to the grand jury."" He says because the prosecution is ongoing, the office won't release any files or other details about what the grand jury received. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron addressing the Republican National Convention in August Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky Attorney General who is speaking live from the state capitol in Frankfort, is the first black man in the state's history to hold the role. The 34-year-old Republican prosecutor is seen as a rising star in the party, and spoke at President Donald Trump's nominating convention last month. Speaking at the Republican convention about racial justice protesters, he said: ""Even as anarchists mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police and innocent bystanders, we Republicans do recognise those who work in good faith towards peace, justice and equality."" During his remarks in Frankfort, he warned protesters to remain peaceful in light of today's announcement or risk arrest and prosecution. Mr Cameron says he understands the pain that Ms Taylor's death has caused. ""I understand that as an Attorney General who is responsible for all 120 counties... I understand that as a black man. How painful this is."" Mr Cameron says this is why it was ""incredibly important"" to his team to ""uncover every fact"". He says that the criticism and scrutiny on his office was ""misplaced"". ""There was not a day that people in this office didn't go to sleep without thinking about this case. ""Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief and that is true here."" Mr Cameron, pausing a moment as he speaks, also says that if something like this were to happen to him, his mother ""would find it very hard"". ""I've seen that pain on Ms Palmer's face,"" he says, referencing Ms Taylor's mother. ""I've seen that pain in the community."" Breonna Taylor was an emergency room technician As the attorney general continues to field reporter questions, let's take a step back and look at what happened that night in March. Ms Taylor was at home in Louisville on 13 March when police officers entered her apartment shortly after midnight, her family says. Narcotics officers raided her home and used a battering ram to take her front door off its hinges. No drugs were found on her property and Ms Taylor had no criminal record. At the time, Ms Taylor was in bed with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, according to her family. Hearing the commotion, Mr Walker believed people were trying to break into the apartment and he later told police he fired one shot of his pistol. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. Mr Mattingly and two other officers, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove, returned fire and shot more than 20 rounds. Mr Walker wasn't wounded but Ms Taylor was hit multiple times and died in the hallway of her apartment. Mr Cameron is asked: why wasn't this a manslaughter charge, given the fact that Ms Taylor died? He says: ""It's important to step back and recognise that what we did was uncover all the information and facts, and then provided that information to the grand jury. ""The grand jury had every piece of detail needed to make their assessment and judgment and ultimately their conclusion was that the decision needed to be made to indict Mr Hankinson."" Breonna Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said earlier this month that she wanted all three officers arrested and charged with murder. Her lawyers asked for manslaughter charges at least, which come in cases where a person's death comes as a result of a perpetrator's violent actions but is not intentional. Ms Palmer's comments came last week, when she won a $12m settlement from the city that included a raft of police reforms, including an end to no-knock warrants.

"Breonna Taylor officer charged but not over deathBrett Hankison is accused of endangering neighbours, but two other officers are not charged.","This video can not be played Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented the grand jury decision A police officer has been charged over the narcotics raid that resulted in the fatal shooting of a black woman at her home in the US state of Kentucky. Breonna Taylor, 26, a hospital worker, was shot multiple times as officers stormed her home on 13 March. Brett Hankison has been charged, not with Ms Taylor's death, but with ""wanton endangerment"" for firing into a neighbour's apartment in Louisville. Two other officers who were involved have not been charged. Under Kentucky law, someone is guilty of wanton endangerment if they commit an act that shows ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". This lowest-level felony offence can come with a five-year sentence for each count. Mr Hankison was charged on three counts. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of US police killings Ms Taylor's relatives and activists for whom her death has become a rallying cry had been calling for the three officers, who are all white, to be charged with murder or manslaughter. But this was rejected by a grand jury that reviewed the evidence. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died On Wednesday, Judge Annie O'Connell announced the charges that had been brought by a grand jury against Mr Hankison. Kentucky Attorney General Mr Cameron then held a news conference in which he expanded on the decision. ""This is a gut-wrenching emotional case,"" he said. ""There is nothing I can offer them today to take away the grief and heartache as a result of losing a child, a niece, a sister and a friend,"" he added in a message to Ms Taylor's family. Mr Cameron said a ballistics report had found that six bullets struck Ms Taylor, but only one was fatal. That analysis concluded that Detective Myles Cosgrove had fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. The attorney general said it was not clear if Mr Hankison's shots had hit Ms Taylor, but they had hit a neighbouring apartment. This video can not be played Protesters march in Louisville following the grand jury decision The top prosecutor said the other two officers - Jonathan Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove - had been ""justified to protect themselves and the justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges"". Mr Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first black attorney general, added: ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. ""Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge."" He added that the FBI was still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. The National Guard were deployed in Louisville ahead of the announcement Ben Crump, a high-profile lawyer for the Taylor family, said the outcome was ""outrageous and offensive"". Officials this month agreed to pay her family $12m (Â£9.3m) in a settlement. Asked for his reaction to the decision, Mr Trump told a White House news conference: ""I thought it was really brilliant."" He praised Kentucky's attorney general, who addressed the Republican party convention last month, for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""I think he's a star,"" he said, adding that he approved of the Kentucky governor's decision to send in the National Guard. Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Kentucky prosecutors to release the evidence that was presented to the grand jury. ""I think having more of the facts out there so people can see, people can truly process it, is where we need to be,"" Mr Beshear told reporters. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville on Tuesday and protests are expected. The National Guard have also been deployed. Mayor Greg Fischer has set a 21:00-06:30 curfew in the city that will remain in place for the next 72 hours. He earlier said he had declared a state of emergency ""due to the potential for civil unrest"". Police have closed traffic on certain streets where protests have been prevalent, and barricades have been erected around the city centre. Demonstrations over Ms Taylor's death have been held in the city for more than 100 consecutive days. The National Guard deployment has been criticised because one of its troops fatally shot a black restaurant owner, David McAtee, as authorities dispersed Black Lives Matter protesters in June. The police department said its officers had come under fire while they were trying to clear the area. But after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras, the city's police chief was sacked. Shortly after midnight on Friday 13 March, she was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when they heard a banging on the door. Plainclothes Louisville police officers were carrying out a narcotics raid, and they used a battering ram to enter the property. A judge had granted a warrant to search Ms Taylor's home because investigators suspected a convicted drug dealer - her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover - was using the address to receive packages. She had no criminal record. Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, later told police he thought the late-night intruder was Glover, according to the New York Times. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI. The death of Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor, who had also got out of bed amid the commotion, was shot and died on the hallway floor. According to an arrest report, the officers had been granted a ""no-knock"" warrant, allowing them to enter the property without warning. But Mr Cameron said on Wednesday the officers had not actually served such a warrant. The attorney general said the officers' statements that they identified themselves ""are corroborated by an independent witness"". Some neighbours told local media they did not hear the officers announce themselves. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County prosecutor Thomas Wine has previously said the search was cancelled after the shooting. The subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Ms Taylor's injuries as ""none"" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used. Mr Walker was initially charged with attempted murder and assault of a police officer, but the case against him was dropped in May amid national scrutiny of the case. From left: Brett Hankison, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove Mr Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after investigators found he had ""wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds"" during the raid, according to his termination letter. Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties. The Louisville Courier-Journal has reported that six officers are under internal police review for their role in the shooting. Seven solutions to US police problems Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Mr Mattingly wrote an email on Saturday to more than 1,000 colleagues in which he criticised city leaders and protesters. ""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,"" he wrote in the message, which was published by media outlets on Tuesday. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonised, and the criminals are canonised."" ""Your civil rights mean nothing,"" he added, ""but the criminal has total autonomy."" Are you in Louisville?

McDonald's 'does not need table service'The government has clarified new guidelines designed to slow the spread of coronavirus.Business,"McDonald's, Pret a Manger and similar restaurants without an alcohol licence will not need to serve customers at tables, the government has confirmed. On Tuesday new rules governing hospitality were announced. They mean pubs and other places with licensed premises must provide table service. Confusion had been sparked after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested on Wednesday that all restaurants could need table service. He told the Today programme: ""In all of the restaurants and hospitality you can go in and order from the tables - what you can't do without a mask is just sit around and mill around. ""My understanding is that you need to be able to order from the tables. But of course the guidance will be very clear."" The updated guidelines specified that all pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England must have a 22:00 closing time from Thursday. These measures are designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Cases and hospital admissions in the UK are rising again,which prompted the updated guidance. Industry group UK Hospitality criticised the government approach, saying restaurants and pubs were having to make changes at short notice. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: ""Our understanding is that quick-service restaurants will be exempt from the new rules, but there is certainly a degree of confusion. ""The government is clearly struggling to catch up with announcements and policy is changing on a daily basis. ""Businesses deserve better than this when they are expected to follow new rules at short notice. Particularly when those rules are going to have such an impact."" Ms Nicholls added that the previous guidelines were better for pubs and restaurants as they allowed businesses more flexibility in implementing coronavirus measures. ""Venues are not identical, even outwardly similar ones, so there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works. ""Business owners know what works from them in their venues. They are the best placed to know how to control the flow of customers through their business."" Thenew rulesin England state businesses must take customers' contact details by law, so they can be traced if there is a coronavirus outbreak. They can be fined up to Â£10,000 for not doing this, or if they take reservations of more than six, or do not enforce social distancing. Staff in hospitality venues must now wear masks, as must customers who are not seated at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing a mask, or breaking the ''rule of six'' has doubled to Â£200 for a first offence. In Wales, pubs, bars and restaurants will also have to close by 22:00 from Thursday, with supermarkets and off-licences not allowed to sell alcohol after that time. In Scotland, a 22:00 curfew comes in on Friday. Customers must wear face coverings if they are not seated at a table.

Brexit: Lorries will need a permit to enter KentThe government plans to create an internal border to prevent gridlock on the county's motorways.BusinessComments,"Truck drivers will need a permit to enter Kent after the Brexit transition period ends, the government has said. The announcement comes after a letter from cabinet minister Michael Gove warned that queues 7,000-trucks-long could clog up roads around the port of Dover and Channel Tunnel. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said the Kent Access Permit system would be enforced by police and ANPR cameras. It is intended to ensure drivers have all the paperwork they need, he said. Drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to apply for the permits online and show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for no-deal planning, wrote to logistics groups with the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" planning for when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union rules on 1 January. In that scenario, he said just half of big businesses and 20% of small businesses would be ready for the strict application of new EU requirements at the border. ""In those circumstances that could mean between only 30% and 60% of laden HGVs would arrive at the border with the necessary formalities completed for the goods on board,"" he told MPs. ""They'd therefore be turned back by the French border authorities, clogging the Dover to Calais crossing."" He said it could lead to delays of up to two days for drivers waiting to cross the Channel. Although he said those queues were likely to subside after businesses learned from seeing their cargo denied access to the continent. The transition period is due to expire at the end of the year but only a quarter of businesses are ""fully ready"" for the post-Brexit arrangements, Mr Gove said. Imports will also be disrupted in January, according to the letter sent to the freight industry by Mr Gove. It also raises the prospect of a winter spike in Covid-19 leading to absences of port and border staff. Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said: ""It is incredible that ministers are only now admitting to their plans to arrest British truckers for entering Kent without new travel passports. With just over three months to go, how are businesses meant to prepare amid this Conservative carnival of incompetence?'"" What is the Brexit transition period? How many trade deals has the UK done? What do I need to know about Brexit now? A simple guide The picture of chaos at the border might be familiar from a similar set of projections made for no-deal Brexit a year ago as part of what was known as Operation Yellowhammer. The government says this is not a prediction but an illustration of what could be reasonably expected. Moreover, Mr Gove told parliament on Wednesday the government was ""absolutely determined to do everything that we can to secure a deal"". According to the Cabinet Office document, without a free trade deal and in its reasonable worst-case scenario, there may be ""maximum queues of 7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days"". ""Both imports and exports could be disrupted to a similar extent,"" it says. The EU is expected to impose full goods controls on the UK, stopping all freight without the correct documentation at the end of the transition period on 1 January. The disruption is assumed to build in the first two weeks of January, and could last three months, or longer should France rigorously apply Schengen passport checks on hauliers at Dover and the Channel Tunnel. Brexit jargon explained The purpose of this stark communication is to try to get traders to act now to get ready for new border formalities that could help mitigate the disruption. Mr Gove told the industry that this needs to happen irrespective of whether or not there is a deal in the UK-EU trade negotiations. In response the freight industry says putting in place the measures needed to avoid border delays will be ""a huge challenge for government and industry"". Logistics UK, representing road, rail, sea and air haulage firms says it is urging businesses to quickly install and understand the new processes they will need to use. But firms need early access to both UK and EU systems so that they can conduct testing and training before 1 January, it says. A recent meeting between the industry and government was described as a ""washout"", with insiders describing the relationship as ""fraught"" and hauliers fearful that they were being cast as the ""fall guys"" for delays and disruption likely in January. There are further issues should there be no trade deal agreed. Hauliers would have to rely on special permits rationed by the Department for Transport, though a mutually beneficial deal here is possible. But discussions on these issues await settlement of the impasse in negotiations on state aid and fisheries. This video can not be played The government is ""not pointing the finger"" at hauliers, Michael Gove told the BBC Industry sources have raised the possibility that the UK would have to sign up to EU rules limiting driver hours, in order to get access to EU roads. And there is a specific new reference to France imposing strict passport checks at the ""juxtaposed controls"" currently designed to offer seamless travel across the Channel. ""There also remains a risk of continuing disruption caused by Schengen controls being applied rigorously at the juxtaposed controls at the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel,"" the document says.

Scotland records highest number of new virus cases,"Scotland recorded 486 new positive coronavirus tests which represented the biggest single day's number since mass testing began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figures were concerning, and underlined why new restrictions had been imposed. But she acknowledged many more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak in mid-April. Ms Sturgeon said 224 of the new cases were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with 107 in Lanarkshire and 57 in Lothian. The number of positive tests was 103 higher than the figure recorded on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases in Scotland to 25,495. Latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland Ms Sturgeon said the number in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area included a ""significant"" outbreak at Glasgow University. Testing strategy has changedradically in Scotland since the peak of the outbreak and there is now widespread community testing, including near to university campuses. On 15 April, 1,209 people were tested, but six times that number were being tested by mid-September. From Wednesday, people across Scotland were banned from visiting other people's homes, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus risks ""spiralling out of control"" unless urgent action is taken. The move, which had already been in force in Glasgow and other areas of the west of Scotland, means the country has tougher coronavirus restrictions than England, where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. Scotland, like England, will also impose a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants from Friday - which the trade has warned could cost jobs and force some premises to close completely. Scotland is currently carrying out about 10 times more tests every day than it was at the height of the outbreak in April. Speaking at her daily briefing on Wednesday, the first minister said: ""The total number of positive cases reported yesterday was 486 - that is the highest number of positive cases we have ever recorded in a single day. ""It must be remembered that many more people are being tested now than was the case in the spring. ""Nevertheless, today's number represents 7.8% of people newly tested. That is obviously a real cause for concern, but it also underlines why we took very decisive and very tough action yesterday."" Many pub and restaurant owners have criticised plan to impose a 10pm curfew from Friday Ms Sturgeon also hinted that she would have taken tougher action on pubs than a 10pm curfew if she had ""the ability to  bring more financial firepower to mitigate the jobs and economic impact"". But Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross accused her of ""making the usual, tired political points"", adding: ""The middle of the pandemic is the wrong time to raise long-standing constitutional grievances."" The BBC understands UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking at options toreplace the furlough schemewhen it expires at the end of October. Ms Sturgeon had said at the end of June that she believed Scotland was ""not far away"" from eliminating the virus. On Wednesday, she said she could understand why many people felt like the country was now ""back to square one"" after the new nationwide restriction on visiting other homes was imposed. She said this was ""emphatically not the case"", despite the recent resurgence in cases. Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars The first minister said: ""For a start, the action we took to suppress the virus over the summer meant that we have faced this resurgence from a lower base. ""That matters, and it is entirely thanks to the lockdown restrictions and all of the individual sacrifices that everyone has made."" She said the rise in the number of cases was accelerating, but was still ""not as rapid"" as earlier in the year. A protest against the continuing closure of soft play facilities across Scotland was held outside the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday And she insisted that the country's test and protect contact tracing system was ""working well"" and was succeeding in breaking transmission chains. However, Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon said the system had struggled to cope when schools returned in August, and said there was still not enough routine testing in hospitals, care homes and schools. She also called for routine testing to be done in universities, adding: ""I think we have to be much more ambitious on testing in Scotland and right across the UK."" Ms Lennon said: ""We are still not testing enough. What we need to see in the coming days and weeks is mass testing being rolled out. ""We are in react mode and we didn't have the foresight to put measures in place"". All 500 students at Parker House in Dundee are self-isolating Several universities across Scotland have been dealing with outbreaks of the virus in recent days - with500 students at a hall of residence in Dundeebeing told to self-isolate after a positive case and several suspected cases emerged. In a direct appeal to students, Ms Sturgeon said they must follow the rules on self-isolating if told to do so. And she said the government would not hesitate to toughen the rules for colleges and universities if necessary. It later emerged that124 students at the University of Glasgowhad tested positive since the start of term, with social interaction in Freshers Week thought to be largely to blame.

"Harry urges US voters to 'reject hate speech'His ""non-partisan"" plea has caused controversy, since royals are expected to stay politically neutral.","Prince Harry has urged US citizens to ""reject hate speech"" and vote in the country's upcoming presidential election. He made the remarks alongside his wife, Meghan, in a US television broadcast. A spokesperson for the couple said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead ""a call for decency"". Voting for the next US president, with candidates including Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, is on 3 November. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Prince Harry repays cottage renovation cost No other option but to step back, says Harry The Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in a live video in what appeared to be their California home as part of the Time 100 - a list compiled by Time magazine to celebrate the world's most influential people. It was their first joint TV appearance since theyceased being working members of the Royal Family in March. ""As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,"" the duke said as he sat on a bench alongside Meghan. He also reminded Americans to be discerning in the content they consumed online. ""When the bad outweighs the good, for many, whether we realise it or not, it erodes our ability to have compassion and our ability to put ourself in someone else's shoes,"" he said. ""Because when one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act."" The 36-year-old duke said he would not be voting in the election because he was not a US citizen, adding that he had never voted in UK elections either. Members of the Royal Family traditionally do not vote, and the Queen is politically neutral. Although UK law does not ban royalty from voting, it is considered unconstitutional for them to do so. Harry and Meghan stepped aside from their roles as senior working royals in March in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family. By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent When Harry and Meghan ceased to be working royals back in March, the official ""divorce"" statement read: ""While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty."" It is Harry's contribution to the Time video message which seems to have attracted the most comment. His spokesman is clear that the duke was making a ""non-partisan call for decency"". But with the Trump administration commonly accused of the traits called out by Harry - ""hate speech, misinformation and online negativity""- his contribution has been widely interpreted as party political. The expectation is that royals remain neutral and the question troubling many people today is whether that means Harry's words are incompatible with the statement issued by the palace in March. It was always going to be difficult to work a way through their royal/non-royal status to the satisfaction of the Sussexes and the Royal Family, as this latest episode once again makes clear. Reacting to the couple's remarks, Royal biographer Robert Jobson said: ""They are not carrying out public duties, live abroad and are really completely detached from our monarchical system now so what difference would it make? ""Meghan, after all, holds American citizenship and has always voted. The business about royals not getting involved in politics is less clear when it comes to Meghan or what the protocol should be in this case. ""But as she is now back living in her country I am sure many would think it wrong that she is not allowed to exercise her democratic right to vote."" However, Mr Jobson said ""it would be better"" for Prince Harry to withdraw from the line of succession ""to avoid further confusion"". And if they were to leave their royal titles behind it may set the duchess ""free to pursue a political career,"" he added. But former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said Prince Harry should not have remarked on the US election as he is still a ""representative"" of the UK. There was ""no problem"" with a ""private citizen"" expressing their views, he said, ""the problem is Harry still has his HRH status"". ""He wants his foot in both camps,"" said the author of the book And What Do You Do? What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know. The duchess, who mocked then-Republican candidate Mr Trump during a 2016 television appearance, said in the video that the November poll was the ""most important election of our lifetime"". ""When we vote, our values are put into action and our voices are heard. Your voice is a reminder that you matter, because you do and you deserve to be heard,"" she said. A spokesperson for the couple said: ""His message is not in reference to any specific political party or candidate, but is instead a call for decency in how we engage with each other, interact, and consume information - especially online."" A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: ""We would not comment. The duke is not a working member of the Royal Family and any comments he makes are made in a personal capacity.""

Policeman charged over Breonna Taylor shootingA US grand jury charges one police officer over the death of a black woman in her home in Kentucky.,"This video can not be played Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented the grand jury decision A police officer has been charged over the narcotics raid that resulted in the fatal shooting of a black woman at her home in the US state of Kentucky. Breonna Taylor, 26, a hospital worker, was shot multiple times as officers stormed her home on 13 March. Brett Hankison has been charged, not with Ms Taylor's death, but with ""wanton endangerment"" for firing into a neighbour's apartment in Louisville. Two other officers who were involved have not been charged. Under Kentucky law, someone is guilty of wanton endangerment if they commit an act that shows ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life"". This lowest-level felony offence can come with a five-year sentence for each count. Mr Hankison was charged on three counts. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of US police killings Ms Taylor's relatives and activists for whom her death has become a rallying cry had been calling for the three officers, who are all white, to be charged with murder or manslaughter. But this was rejected by a grand jury that reviewed the evidence. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was 26 when she died On Wednesday, Judge Annie O'Connell announced the charges that had been brought by a grand jury against Mr Hankison. Kentucky Attorney General Mr Cameron then held a news conference in which he expanded on the decision. ""This is a gut-wrenching emotional case,"" he said. ""There is nothing I can offer them today to take away the grief and heartache as a result of losing a child, a niece, a sister and a friend,"" he added in a message to Ms Taylor's family. Mr Cameron said a ballistics report had found that six bullets struck Ms Taylor, but only one was fatal. That analysis concluded that Detective Myles Cosgrove had fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor. The attorney general said it was not clear if Mr Hankison's shots had hit Ms Taylor, but they had hit a neighbouring apartment. This video can not be played Protesters march in Louisville following the grand jury decision The top prosecutor said the other two officers - Jonathan Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove - had been ""justified to protect themselves and the justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges"". Mr Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first black attorney general, added: ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. ""Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge."" He added that the FBI was still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. The National Guard were deployed in Louisville ahead of the announcement Ben Crump, a high-profile lawyer for the Taylor family, said the outcome was ""outrageous and offensive"". Officials this month agreed to pay her family $12m (Â£9.3m) in a settlement. Asked for his reaction to the decision, Mr Trump told a White House news conference: ""I thought it was really brilliant."" He praised Kentucky's attorney general, who addressed the Republican party convention last month, for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""I think he's a star,"" he said, adding that he approved of the Kentucky governor's decision to send in the National Guard. Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Kentucky prosecutors to release the evidence that was presented to the grand jury. ""I think having more of the facts out there so people can see, people can truly process it, is where we need to be,"" Mr Beshear told reporters. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville on Tuesday and protests are expected. The National Guard have also been deployed. Mayor Greg Fischer has set a 21:00-06:30 curfew in the city that will remain in place for the next 72 hours. He earlier said he had declared a state of emergency ""due to the potential for civil unrest"". Police have closed traffic on certain streets where protests have been prevalent, and barricades have been erected around the city centre. Demonstrations over Ms Taylor's death have been held in the city for more than 100 consecutive days. The National Guard deployment has been criticised because one of its troops fatally shot a black restaurant owner, David McAtee, as authorities dispersed Black Lives Matter protesters in June. The police department said its officers had come under fire while they were trying to clear the area. But after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras, the city's police chief was sacked. Shortly after midnight on Friday 13 March, she was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when they heard a banging on the door. Plainclothes Louisville police officers were carrying out a narcotics raid, and they used a battering ram to enter the property. A judge had granted a warrant to search Ms Taylor's home because investigators suspected a convicted drug dealer - her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover - was using the address to receive packages. She had no criminal record. Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, later told police he thought the late-night intruder was Glover, according to the New York Times. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI. The death of Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor, who had also got out of bed amid the commotion, was shot and died on the hallway floor. According to an arrest report, the officers had been granted a ""no-knock"" warrant, allowing them to enter the property without warning. But Mr Cameron said on Wednesday the officers had not actually served such a warrant. The attorney general said the officers' statements that they identified themselves ""are corroborated by an independent witness"". Some neighbours told local media they did not hear the officers announce themselves. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County prosecutor Thomas Wine has previously said the search was cancelled after the shooting. The subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Ms Taylor's injuries as ""none"" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used. Mr Walker was initially charged with attempted murder and assault of a police officer, but the case against him was dropped in May amid national scrutiny of the case. From left: Brett Hankison, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove Mr Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after investigators found he had ""wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds"" during the raid, according to his termination letter. Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties. The Louisville Courier-Journal has reported that six officers are under internal police review for their role in the shooting. Seven solutions to US police problems Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Mr Mattingly wrote an email on Saturday to more than 1,000 colleagues in which he criticised city leaders and protesters. ""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,"" he wrote in the message, which was published by media outlets on Tuesday. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonised, and the criminals are canonised."" ""Your civil rights mean nothing,"" he added, ""but the criminal has total autonomy."" Are you in Louisville?

The attorney general said it was not clear if Mr Hankison's shots had hit Ms Taylor, but they had hit a neighbouring apartment. This video can not be played Protesters march in Louisville following the grand jury decision The top prosecutor said the other two officers - Jonathan Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove - had been ""justified to protect themselves and the justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges"". Mr Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first black attorney general, added: ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. ""Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge."" He added that the FBI was still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. The National Guard were deployed in Louisville ahead of the announcement Ben Crump, a high-profile lawyer for the Taylor family, said the outcome was ""outrageous and offensive"". Officials this month agreed to pay her family $12m (Â£9.3m) in a settlement. Asked for his reaction to the decision, Mr Trump told a White House news conference: ""I thought it was really brilliant."" He praised Kentucky's attorney general, who addressed the Republican party convention last month, for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""I think he's a star,"" he said, adding that he approved of the Kentucky governor's decision to send in the National Guard. Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Kentucky prosecutors to release the evidence that was presented to the grand jury. ""I think having more of the facts out there so people can see, people can truly process it, is where we need to be,"" Mr Beshear told reporters. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville on Tuesday and protests are expected. The National Guard have also been deployed. Mayor Greg Fischer has set a 21:00-06:30 curfew in the city that will remain in place for the next 72 hours. He earlier said he had declared a state of emergency ""due to the potential for civil unrest"". Police have closed traffic on certain streets where protests have been prevalent, and barricades have been erected around the city centre. Demonstrations over Ms Taylor's death have been held in the city for more than 100 consecutive days. The National Guard deployment has been criticised because one of its troops fatally shot a black restaurant owner, David McAtee, as authorities dispersed Black Lives Matter protesters in June. The police department said its officers had come under fire while they were trying to clear the area. But after officers on the scene were found to have not activated their body cameras, the city's police chief was sacked. Shortly after midnight on Friday 13 March, she was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when they heard a banging on the door. Plainclothes Louisville police officers were carrying out a narcotics raid, and they used a battering ram to enter the property. A judge had granted a warrant to search Ms Taylor's home because investigators suspected a convicted drug dealer - her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover - was using the address to receive packages. She had no criminal record. Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, later told police he thought the late-night intruder was Glover, according to the New York Times. Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck a police officer, Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg - an injury for which he later required surgery. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI. The death of Breonna Taylor Ms Taylor, who had also got out of bed amid the commotion, was shot and died on the hallway floor. According to an arrest report, the officers had been granted a ""no-knock"" warrant, allowing them to enter the property without warning. But Mr Cameron said on Wednesday the officers had not actually served such a warrant. The attorney general said the officers' statements that they identified themselves ""are corroborated by an independent witness"". Some neighbours told local media they did not hear the officers announce themselves. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County prosecutor Thomas Wine has previously said the search was cancelled after the shooting. The subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Ms Taylor's injuries as ""none"" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used. Mr Walker was initially charged with attempted murder and assault of a police officer, but the case against him was dropped in May amid national scrutiny of the case. From left: Brett Hankison, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove Mr Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after investigators found he had ""wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds"" during the raid, according to his termination letter. Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties. The Louisville Courier-Journal has reported that six officers are under internal police review for their role in the shooting. Seven solutions to US police problems Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Mr Mattingly wrote an email on Saturday to more than 1,000 colleagues in which he criticised city leaders and protesters. ""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,"" he wrote in the message, which was published by media outlets on Tuesday. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonised, and the criminals are canonised."" ""Your civil rights mean nothing,"" he added, ""but the criminal has total autonomy."" Are you in Louisville?

McDonald's 'does not need table service',"McDonald's, Pret a Manger and similar restaurants without an alcohol licence will not need to serve customers at tables, the government has confirmed. On Tuesday new rules governing hospitality were announced. They mean pubs and other places with licensed premises must provide table service. Confusion had been sparked after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested on Wednesday that all restaurants could need table service. He told the Today programme: ""In all of the restaurants and hospitality you can go in and order from the tables - what you can't do without a mask is just sit around and mill around. ""My understanding is that you need to be able to order from the tables. But of course the guidance will be very clear."" The updated guidelines specified that all pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England must have a 22:00 closing time from Thursday. These measures are designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Cases and hospital admissions in the UK are rising again,which prompted the updated guidance. Industry group UK Hospitality criticised the government approach, saying restaurants and pubs were having to make changes at short notice. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: ""Our understanding is that quick-service restaurants will be exempt from the new rules, but there is certainly a degree of confusion. ""The government is clearly struggling to catch up with announcements and policy is changing on a daily basis. ""Businesses deserve better than this when they are expected to follow new rules at short notice. Particularly when those rules are going to have such an impact."" Ms Nicholls added that the previous guidelines were better for pubs and restaurants as they allowed businesses more flexibility in implementing coronavirus measures. ""Venues are not identical, even outwardly similar ones, so there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works. ""Business owners know what works from them in their venues. They are the best placed to know how to control the flow of customers through their business."" Thenew rulesin England state businesses must take customers' contact details by law, so they can be traced if there is a coronavirus outbreak. They can be fined up to Â£10,000 for not doing this, or if they take reservations of more than six, or do not enforce social distancing. Staff in hospitality venues must now wear masks, as must customers who are not seated at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing a mask, or breaking the ''rule of six'' has doubled to Â£200 for a first offence. In Wales, pubs, bars and restaurants will also have to close by 22:00 from Thursday, with supermarkets and off-licences not allowed to sell alcohol after that time. In Scotland, a 22:00 curfew comes in on Friday. Customers must wear face coverings if they are not seated at a table.

The toughest workplace romance rules in the world?,"New rules over office romances are being rolled out at the investment giant BlackRock. They will now extend to relationships outside the office in a bid to clamp down on conflicts of interest. BlackRock staff were already expected to tell managers if they were dating one of their 16,000 colleagues. But the new policy, shared in a memo with staff, says they must disclose relationships with ""external partners"" with a connection to the firm. The size of the New York based firm, which has more than $7tn under management and vast numbers of suppliers and clients around the globe, means that the new rules will have far-reaching implications, shining a probing light into the personal lives of potentially hundreds of thousands of people. It follows the #Metoo movement, which revealed sexual harassment within a range of professional settings and focused attention on workplace strategies to clamp down on relationships between bosses and subordinates. McDonald's chief executive Steve Easterbrook was removed last year after a relationship with a colleague came to light. At BlackRock late last year senior executive Mark Wiseman, was fired for failing to disclose an affair with a colleague. He had been  tipped as a possible successor to the firm's high profile chief executive Larry Fink. McDonald's ex-boss fights sexual liaison claims Work romance: 'I was sacked for falling in love' While many workplaces require staff to be open about relationships with colleagues, BlackRock's new policy is unusual in asking for information about partners at other firms. The policy says they should disclose any personal relationship they have at any ""service provider, vendor, or other third party (including a client), if the non-BlackRock employee is within a group that interacts with BlackRock"", according to the internal memo, seen by the BBC. Former McDonald's boss Steve Easterbrook lost his job over a relationship with a colleague The aim is to tackle any conflicts of interest, or perceived conflicts of interest, by taking the matter out of the hands of the employee concerned and allowing human resources and lawyers at the firm assess whether there is a problem. But there is a new urgency around managing private and professional boundaries thanks to the switch to working from home prompted by the pandemic. ""I can see why it is an issue for [BlackRock],"" says Tom McLaughlin, employment lawyer with BDBF. ""We are staring down the barrel of the majority of office workers working from home again. Employers will realise they do need to know more about people's domestic arrangements than they did before."" The new policy defines which relationships come under the new policy as any that could be ""susceptible to perceived impropriety, bias, favouritism, and/or abuse of authority within a work environment"". That includes not only romantic or sexual relationships, but family connections and outside business interests,but not ""friendships with work colleagues."" However it is not clear from the memo where the threshold lies, at what point does a friendship, or a series of dates, becomes significant enough to require disclosure. There is no law prohibiting employers from asking questions about relationships, but the answers will need to be treated carefully to comply with privacy rules. ""The real crunch will come if there is a perceived conflict of interest,"" says Mr Tom McLaughlin. BlackRock says disclosures would be treated with discretion, and if necessary, ""alternative work arrangements"" may be put in place. Did you meet your partner through work contacts?

He said his granddaughter was a ""determined young lady"" and ""music was her life"". Families have been presenting ""pen portraits"" at the inquiry for the final day. The portraits are designed to give an insight into the lives of those who died. Twenty-two people were killed in the bombing in May 2017. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry?

"Daily reported UK Covid cases rise by a quarterThere have been 6,178 cases in the UK in the last 24 hours, up 1,252 cases since Tuesday.UK","The number of daily reported Covid-19 cases has risen by a quarter, according to the latest UK government figures. There have been 6,178 coronavirus cases in the UK in the last 24 hours, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said it was ""essential"" the public followed the new measures brought in to curb the spread. Tighter restrictions were announced across the UK on Tuesday, including a 22:00 closing time for pubsin England,external. People are being told to work from home if they can, rules on face coverings have been expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings in England has been halved. 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' Where do I have to wear a face covering now? New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Meanwhile,Scotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. In Walesthere were a further 389 casesand in Northern Irelandthere were 220 cases in the past 24 hours,external. Reacting to the UK figures, Ms Doyle said: ""New measures have been bought in to stop the spread of the virus and it is essential that you follow them. ""You should work from home if you can, must now wear a face covering in retail and hospitality settings, unless you are eating or drinking, and not be in a group larger than six people. Announcing the tighter restrictions for England on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said theymight have to stay in place for up to six months. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said the need for new Covid restrictions was not down to an ""act of God"" but a ""failure of government"" In a televised response to the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported the further ""necessary"" restrictions introduced by the government. But he said The government needed to ""fix"" testing ""fast"", saying: ""It's a national scandal that we still don't have a testing system that works,"" and that was ""the only way we can get control of the virus"". ""The return of this virus, and the return of restrictions, are not an act of God,"" he added. ""They're a failure of government."" Referring to reports of people struggling to get hold of coronavirus tests in recent weeks, Sir Keir said: ""People shouldn't have to travel hundreds of miles to get a test for their child, for themselves or for their relatives."" What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? Sir Keir also warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government didn't provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ended. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happensafter the scheme expires at the end of October. We should be very careful about reading too much into a single day's rise - the jump of more than 1,000 is rapid and if repeated would mean daily case numbers doubling in less than a week. But figures can fluctuate from day to day. Nonetheless, the UK has been warned it should be prepared for cases to continue growing. The figure for new cases is well below what was seen at the peak, which was estimated at 100,000 cases a day. We don't know for sure, since a lack of testing meant the system was only picking up the tip of the iceberg then. Clearly we are not picking up all the cases now - the evidence from last week's surveillance report suggested perhaps only half were being identified by the testing programme. What matters now is whether this scale of rise is repeated in the coming days and weeks - and how that translates into hospitalisations and deaths, both of which are going up too. The data from Spain and France suggests that sharp rises can slow, and upward trends in admissions to hospital can be reversed. But, make no mistake, the UK is entering a crucial point in the battle against the virus. Earlier Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measuresamid criticism from some scientists.

"Raab defends 'targeted' new Covid measuresSome scientists say they don't go ""anywhere near far enough"", while others say they need time to work.UK","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measures amid criticism from some scientists. In England,,externalpeople are being told to work from home if they can and rules on face coverings have been expanded. The measures have exposed a split among scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"". But other scientists say they hope they are a shift towards a coherent policy. It comes asScotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. What are the new rules? Sunak weighs up new worker pay subsidy scheme McDonald's 'does not need table service' Asda to crack down on shoppers without face masks Tighter restrictions were announced in all four UK nations on Tuesday. In England these include a 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants from Thursday and the number of people allowed at weddings has been halved. The fines for breaking the rules are set to increase to Â£200 on the first offence. Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he supports the new measures, but during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions he accused Boris Johnson of ""losing control"" of the virus and of virus testing. Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. Earlier, Mr Raab said there would always be the ""Goldilocks criticism - too much or too little"" of the government's strategy, but that the aim was to avoid the need for more drastic action. He said if people followed all the existing measures, the country would ""get through this"" and ""get to Christmas not in a national lockdown"". He said there was no fixed end time to the measures - which the prime minister has warnedcould last up to six months. This video can not be played Collective health depended on ""individual behaviour"", Mr Johnson said In an interview on Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Edmunds said the comprehensive lockdown in March had brought the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - down from 2.7 to 0.7. A large range of measures was now needed to stop the epidemic growing any further, he said, casting doubt on the changes of R being below one by Christmas. ""I suspect not. There's a chance, of course there's a chance,"" he said. ""To slow the epidemic down will mean putting the brakes on very hard. I suspect we will see very stringent measures coming in through the UK but it will be too late,"" he warned. Prof Peter Openshaw,  who is also a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a ban on households mixing indoors in England ""ought to be instituted sooner rather than later"". Speaking to Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, he said: ""I think [a ban] may well be coming very soon. I would think if we wait two or three weeks, it will be too late."" The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, is reported to believe it is inevitable England will to have to follow Scotland's latest move,according to the Times,external. Another scientist, Prof Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said the measures seemed to show the emphasis of public policy was moving towards personal responsibility, similar to the approach taken in Sweden. He told Today. ""We're starting to understand that we're trying to control the spread of infection as opposed to suppress it."" He added it was important to give these new measures time to work, maintain a clear and consistent public message and not to panic. The debate about what is the right thing to do is just going to get more heated in the coming days and weeks. Cases are rising - and most experts agree the steps taken by the government, certainly in England, are only going to having a minimum effect on curbing an increase in infection rates. What no one knows is how quickly cases will go up - and what impact that will have on hospital admissions and deaths. If the government is determined to suppress the virus - to get the R below one as the prime minister said - more draconian measures will surely follow. But if it was definitely going for this approach, it would surely have gone further with the restrictions it announced on Tuesday. Lockdown-style measures have a greater impact when they are taken earlier. That is what has prompted suggestions it may be moving towards adopting the ""Swedish model"" of accepting some spread. This is being done in the knowledge the UK is now in a better position to protect the vulnerable and treat those who get really sick - enabling ministers to balance the risk of the virus versus the risk to the economy, society and wider health and wellbeing. But it means the big decision is yet to come - and crucial to that will be what happens to hospital cases and deaths. The devolved nations have their own powers over coronavirus restrictions. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney acknowledged the new rules banning people from visiting other people's homes were ""difficult and disruptive"" and said they would be reviewed every three weeks. ""No one wants to have this in place a moment longer. The more public compliance, the more successful we will be,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Analysis: Last throw of dice before the really tough call 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' 'A stitch in time saves nine' - what does it mean? Wales's First Minister, Mark Drakeford, urged people not to let the virus""take a hold of our lives again"", and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said tougher restrictions should act asa ""wake-up call""that ""we are not out of the woods"". Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. And the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37.

There have been 6,178 coronavirus cases in the UK in the last 24 hours, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said it was ""essential"" the public followed the new measures brought in to curb the spread. Tighter restrictions were announced across the UK on Tuesday, including a 22:00 closing time for pubsin England,external.

Meanwhile,Scotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. In Walesthere were a further 389 casesand in Northern Irelandthere were 220 cases in the past 24 hours,external. Reacting to the UK figures, Ms Doyle said: ""New measures have been bought in to stop the spread of the virus and it is essential that you follow them. ""You should work from home if you can, must now wear a face covering in retail and hospitality settings, unless you are eating or drinking, and not be in a group larger than six people. Announcing the tighter restrictions for England on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said theymight have to stay in place for up to six months. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said the need for new Covid restrictions was not down to an ""act of God"" but a ""failure of government"" In a televised response to the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported the further ""necessary"" restrictions introduced by the government. But he said The government needed to ""fix"" testing ""fast"", saying: ""It's a national scandal that we still don't have a testing system that works,"" and that was ""the only way we can get control of the virus"". ""The return of this virus, and the return of restrictions, are not an act of God,"" he added. ""They're a failure of government."" Referring to reports of people struggling to get hold of coronavirus tests in recent weeks, Sir Keir said: ""People shouldn't have to travel hundreds of miles to get a test for their child, for themselves or for their relatives."" What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? Sir Keir also warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government didn't provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ended. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happensafter the scheme expires at the end of October. We should be very careful about reading too much into a single day's rise - the jump of more than 1,000 is rapid and if repeated would mean daily case numbers doubling in less than a week. But figures can fluctuate from day to day. Nonetheless, the UK has been warned it should be prepared for cases to continue growing. The figure for new cases is well below what was seen at the peak, which was estimated at 100,000 cases a day. We don't know for sure, since a lack of testing meant the system was only picking up the tip of the iceberg then. Clearly we are not picking up all the cases now - the evidence from last week's surveillance report suggested perhaps only half were being identified by the testing programme. What matters now is whether this scale of rise is repeated in the coming days and weeks - and how that translates into hospitalisations and deaths, both of which are going up too. The data from Spain and France suggests that sharp rises can slow, and upward trends in admissions to hospital can be reversed. But, make no mistake, the UK is entering a crucial point in the battle against the virus. Earlier Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measuresamid criticism from some scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"",  casting doubt on the changes of the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - being below one by Christmas.

"No case to extend lockdowns, first minister says","This video can not be played Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people not to down their drinks ahead of the new pub curfew There is ""no case"" for more areas to be locked down as new measures to control the rising Covid-19 rate need time to work, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford saidthe six south Wales counties already in lockdownwere the ""trigger point"" and efforts were being concentrated in those ""hotspot"" areas. New Wales-wide measures include early closing times and table service for pubs, cafes and restaurants. But lockdowns could be extended to new areas if necessary, he added. From Thursday at 18:00 BST, licensed premises must stop serving alcohol at 22:00 and off-licences and supermarkets must stop selling alcohol at the same time. He told BBC Breakfast: ""There was not yet a case for extending those [local lockdown] measures to other local authorities, but we would keep them under very close and daily review."" He said the two ""trigger points"" for taking more action in the south Wales counties not yet under lockdown would be a rise in case numbers and the positivity rate. Bridgend is one of six counties under lockdown after a spike in coronavirus cases People in Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport and Blaenau Gwent are only allowed to enter or leave those counties for work, education, or a limited number of other essential reasons. Cardiff, Vale of Glamorgan, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire are on a watch-list for monitoring, and could face lockdown if cases rise. On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford announced a Â£500 payment to support people on low income who were asked to self-isolate. He also asked people to ""only travel when you need to do so"". He reiterated people needed to continue working from home wherever possible and wear face coverings on public transport, in shops and in enclosed public spaces. Mr Drakeford confirmed these measures at a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. This included clarifying the rule on pubs and restaurants to state that theyhad to stop serving alcohol at 22:00, rather than close completely, which he had said in the initial announcement on Tuesday evening. He denied stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 was a ""stab in the dark"", saying there was evidence from Wales' local lockdown areas that a ""small minority of people, late in the evening, when a lot of alcohol has been consumed, behave in ways that cause a risk to other people"". Speaking in the Senedd, he said: ""Our system will allow people to drink up, to eat up, to bring their evening to an orderly close and then make their way home."" 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Welsh universities set for 'different' freshers' week Rathlin Island: The UK island with no coronavirus cases He said there was a ""mixed picture"" about the spread of coronavirus across the country with higher levels in south Wales where lockdowns had been introduced. ""But further west, and in parts of north Wales, the rates are much lower,"" he added. He said people were being admitted to hospital needing treatment for the serious effects of coronavirus and - ""very sadly"" - in the last week, there were a number of deaths from coronavirus. Testing had seen a ""sharp rise"" in demand - 70,000 last week compared to 64,000 the week before, the highest number of tests processed so far in one week. He also told the briefing there was ""no evidence"" that visitors coming into Wales had led to spikes in infections. ""Coronavirus remains at its lowest levels in the holiday areas of Wales. The visitors we have had so far have been people who have acted responsibly and helped us to keep Wales safe."" Mr Drakeford said there was emerging evidence in Caerphilly, the first area to go into local lockdown, that enhanced measures to control the virus were working. ""Recent days have been encouraging. The numbers in Caerphilly have been coming down quite steadily over the last three or four days. ""We will need another couple of days to make sure that that is a sustained trend. ""My aim will be, if we are seeing a reliable improvement in Caerphilly, to begin to restore to people some of the freedoms we've had to withdraw from them."" Mr Drakeford said: ""If [people] act together in that sense of social solidarity, it is still possible to turn the tide on this."" Asked about Christmas get-togethers, he said: ""We will do everything we can and work as hard as we can so that people in Wales will still be able to meet their families, I'm afraid in this more restricted way, come December. ""That fight is still on by government doing what we can, our partners in the local authorities, health authorities and police, but most of all by each one of us in our own lives doing those simple things that we know add up to making the real difference. ""In that way come December we will still be able to get together with those people that mean the most to us and celebrate Christmas."" Mr Drakeford also told the Today programme that, despite the call for essential travel only, it was still ""very possible"" for people in Wales to have a holiday ""without travelling very far at all"". ""So people have got to make those decisions in their own circumstances, so we're not saying 'no holidays' to people,"" he said. ""But just think carefully, avoid unnecessary travel."" Trecco Bay holiday park is one of the UK's largest On Tuesday afternoon, Trecco Bay holiday park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, announced it was closing at 18:00 BST, giving people just hours to pack up and leave the site. The site was fully occupied, meaning about 4,000 people had to leave the same afternoon. Steve Richards, chief executive of Parkdean, which runs the park, said he had taken the decision because of the local lockdown coming into force in Bridgend, but added such resorts were generally in rural, coastal settings with a much lower density of people than typical town centres. ""This closure will affect many businesses and jobs in Porthcawl who rely on the regular influx of tourists to the area and, of course it will mean many hard-working Welsh people who account for over 90% of our guests, will now not be able to enjoy a well-earned break,"" he said. ""We're gutted to leave"", said Keith Evans Among those forced to leave was Keith and Iris Evans of Cimla, Neath, who were only given a few hours to pack up, having been on site since mid-July. ""We're gutted to leave. It's so relaxing here and there's a real community among the owners. ""We were told at 2:45pm that because of lockdown in Bridgend we had to be out by 6pm, but we couldn't. A lot of people didn't like it but they've had to accept it."" Campsite owner Thomas Beynon said there is confusion over travelling to take a holiday Thomas Beynon, owner of Three Cliffs campsite, Gower, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over non-essential travel. ""They [the Welsh Government] have not gone as far as to ask us not to open, but that's what the public has taken it as,"" he said. ""I've had 20 emails today asking are we still open. We're a seasonal business and have missed key parts of the year, [so] September and October could make a big difference. The country can't afford a full lockdown again."" People travelling on motorways through lockdown areasare still allowed to stop at service stations,external, so Sarn services in Bridgend is unaffected by the rule preventing people from outside the county stopping during their journey within its borders. The six counties hit with the lockdown restrictions all adjoin one another in south east Wales At present, the number of people allowed to attend a wedding is 30 - this figure has been cut in half in England. Mr Drakeford said discussions would take place later on whether the number should be reduced. If there was no evidence that numbers at weddings have led to spikes in the virus ""then I think that will point us in the opposite direction,"" he said. Analysis from the BBC shows in the seven days to 19 September, which is the most recent date accurate, updated statistics are available for, Merthyr Tydfil had the 13th highest case rate per 100,000 people in the UK, at 147.5. It was followed by Rhondda Cynon Taf at 136.8 cases per 100,000, with Blaenau Gwent on 94.5, Bridgend on 78.9, Caerphilly on 77.8 and Newport on 57.5. The figures are all higher than those shown by Public Health Wales because it takes a while for test results to come in and be backdated properly. Opposition members criticised the first minister for how he made the announcement on Tuesday - in a broadcast message,rather than in the Senedd. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said: ""I think it always helps if we can have a UK-wide approach to these things. That has been possible, probably eight times out of 10. ""There are numerous meetings and discussions with our colleagues in Cardiff to try and come up with solutions which don't damage the economy. At the same time, protect public health and deal with this very, very difficult virus."" Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, told the Senedd that the announcement was ""seemingly at odds"" with advice given to ministers that stated ""an earlier and more comprehensive response can prevent extended lockdowns"". He called for the Welsh Government to go further and introduce the temporary, or at least earlier, closure of pubs and clubs in areas under local lockdown, and stop the sale of alcohol at off-licences much earlier in those areas at 18:00 or 19:00. Brexit Party Member of the Senedd Mandy Jones criticised the first minister over his travel advice. ""The first minister has now said that people can still holiday in Wales, while repeating the line that they should only travel if essential. The lack of clarity is very troubling,"" she said. The changes announced on Tuesdayare in addition to the local lockdown restrictions. Public Health Wales figures reported 281 further cases of coronavirus on Tuesday,the highest number of cases since April. 'Don't race' to drink up before new pub curfew.

Raab defends 'targeted' new Covid measures,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measures amid criticism from some scientists. In England,,externalpeople are being told to work from home if they can and rules on face coverings have been expanded. The measures have exposed a split among scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"". But other scientists say they hope they are a shift towards a coherent policy. It comes asScotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. What are the new rules? Sunak weighs up new worker pay subsidy scheme McDonald's 'does not need table service' Asda to crack down on shoppers without face masks Tighter restrictions were announced in all four UK nations on Tuesday. In England these include a 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants from Thursday and the number of people allowed at weddings has been halved. The fines for breaking the rules are set to increase to Â£200 on the first offence. Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he supports the new measures, but during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions he accused Boris Johnson of ""losing control"" of the virus and of virus testing. Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. Earlier, Mr Raab said there would always be the ""Goldilocks criticism - too much or too little"" of the government's strategy, but that the aim was to avoid the need for more drastic action. He said if people followed all the existing measures, the country would ""get through this"" and ""get to Christmas not in a national lockdown"". He said there was no fixed end time to the measures - which the prime minister has warnedcould last up to six months. This video can not be played Collective health depended on ""individual behaviour"", Mr Johnson said In an interview on Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Edmunds said the comprehensive lockdown in March had brought the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - down from 2.7 to 0.7. A large range of measures was now needed to stop the epidemic growing any further, he said, casting doubt on the changes of R being below one by Christmas. ""I suspect not. There's a chance, of course there's a chance,"" he said. ""To slow the epidemic down will mean putting the brakes on very hard. I suspect we will see very stringent measures coming in through the UK but it will be too late,"" he warned. Prof Peter Openshaw,  who is also a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a ban on households mixing indoors in England ""ought to be instituted sooner rather than later"". Speaking to Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, he said: ""I think [a ban] may well be coming very soon. I would think if we wait two or three weeks, it will be too late."" The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, is reported to believe it is inevitable England will to have to follow Scotland's latest move,according to the Times,external. Another scientist, Prof Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said the measures seemed to show the emphasis of public policy was moving towards personal responsibility, similar to the approach taken in Sweden. He told Today. ""We're starting to understand that we're trying to control the spread of infection as opposed to suppress it."" He added it was important to give these new measures time to work, maintain a clear and consistent public message and not to panic. The debate about what is the right thing to do is just going to get more heated in the coming days and weeks. Cases are rising - and most experts agree the steps taken by the government, certainly in England, are only going to having a minimum effect on curbing an increase in infection rates. What no one knows is how quickly cases will go up - and what impact that will have on hospital admissions and deaths. If the government is determined to suppress the virus - to get the R below one as the prime minister said - more draconian measures will surely follow. But if it was definitely going for this approach, it would surely have gone further with the restrictions it announced on Tuesday. Lockdown-style measures have a greater impact when they are taken earlier. That is what has prompted suggestions it may be moving towards adopting the ""Swedish model"" of accepting some spread. This is being done in the knowledge the UK is now in a better position to protect the vulnerable and treat those who get really sick - enabling ministers to balance the risk of the virus versus the risk to the economy, society and wider health and wellbeing. But it means the big decision is yet to come - and crucial to that will be what happens to hospital cases and deaths. The devolved nations have their own powers over coronavirus restrictions. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney acknowledged the new rules banning people from visiting other people's homes were ""difficult and disruptive"" and said they would be reviewed every three weeks. ""No one wants to have this in place a moment longer. The more public compliance, the more successful we will be,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Analysis: Last throw of dice before the really tough call 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' 'A stitch in time saves nine' - what does it mean? Wales's First Minister, Mark Drakeford, urged people not to let the virus""take a hold of our lives again"", and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said tougher restrictions should act asa ""wake-up call""that ""we are not out of the woods"". Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. And the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37.

Daily reported Covid cases rise by a quarter,"The number of daily reported Covid-19 cases has risen by a quarter, according to the latest UK government figures. There have been 6,178 coronavirus cases in the UK in the last 24 hours, up 1,252 since Tuesday, and 37 deaths. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said it was ""essential"" the public followed the new measures brought in to curb the spread. Tighter restrictions were announced across the UK on Tuesday, including a 22:00 closing time for pubsin England,external. People are being told to work from home if they can, rules on face coverings have been expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings in England has been halved. 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' Where do I have to wear a face covering now? New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Meanwhile,Scotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. In Walesthere were a further 389 casesand in Northern Irelandthere were 220 cases in the past 24 hours,external. Reacting to the UK figures, Ms Doyle said: ""New measures have been bought in to stop the spread of the virus and it is essential that you follow them. ""You should work from home if you can, must now wear a face covering in retail and hospitality settings, unless you are eating or drinking, and not be in a group larger than six people. Announcing the tighter restrictions for England on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said theymight have to stay in place for up to six months. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said the need for new Covid restrictions was not down to an ""act of God"" but a ""failure of government"" In a televised response to the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported the further ""necessary"" restrictions introduced by the government. But he said The government needed to ""fix"" testing ""fast"", saying: ""It's a national scandal that we still don't have a testing system that works,"" and that was ""the only way we can get control of the virus"". ""The return of this virus, and the return of restrictions, are not an act of God,"" he added. ""They're a failure of government."" Referring to reports of people struggling to get hold of coronavirus tests in recent weeks, Sir Keir said: ""People shouldn't have to travel hundreds of miles to get a test for their child, for themselves or for their relatives."" What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? Sir Keir also warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government didn't provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ended. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happensafter the scheme expires at the end of October. We should be very careful about reading too much into a single day's rise - the jump of more than 1,000 is rapid and if repeated would mean daily case numbers doubling in less than a week. But figures can fluctuate from day to day. Nonetheless, the UK has been warned it should be prepared for cases to continue growing. The figure for new cases is well below what was seen at the peak, which was estimated at 100,000 cases a day. We don't know for sure, since a lack of testing meant the system was only picking up the tip of the iceberg then. Clearly we are not picking up all the cases now - the evidence from last week's surveillance report suggested perhaps only half were being identified by the testing programme. What matters now is whether this scale of rise is repeated in the coming days and weeks - and how that translates into hospitalisations and deaths, both of which are going up too. The data from Spain and France suggests that sharp rises can slow, and upward trends in admissions to hospital can be reversed. But, make no mistake, the UK is entering a crucial point in the battle against the virus. Earlier Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measuresamid criticism from some scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"",  casting doubt on the changes of the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - being below one by Christmas.

Scotland records rise in reported virus casesA further 486 test positive for coronavirus - the biggest single day's number since mass testing began.ScotlandComments,"Scotland recorded 486 new positive coronavirus tests which represented the biggest single day's number since mass testing began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figures were concerning, and underlined why new restrictions had been imposed. But she acknowledged many more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak in mid-April. Ms Sturgeon said 224 of the new cases were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with 107 in Lanarkshire and 57 in Lothian. The number of positive tests was 103 higher than the figure recorded on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases in Scotland to 25,495. Latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland Ms Sturgeon said the number in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area included a ""significant"" outbreak at Glasgow University. Testing strategy has changedradically in Scotland since the peak of the outbreak and there is now widespread community testing, including near to university campuses. On 15 April, 1,209 people were tested, but six times that number were being tested by mid-September. From Wednesday, people across Scotland were banned from visiting other people's homes, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus risks ""spiralling out of control"" unless urgent action is taken. The move, which had already been in force in Glasgow and other areas of the west of Scotland, means the country has tougher coronavirus restrictions than England, where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. Scotland, like England, will also impose a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants from Friday - which the trade has warned could cost jobs and force some premises to close completely. Scotland is currently carrying out about 10 times more tests every day than it was at the height of the outbreak in April. Speaking at her daily briefing on Wednesday, the first minister said: ""The total number of positive cases reported yesterday was 486 - that is the highest number of positive cases we have ever recorded in a single day. ""It must be remembered that many more people are being tested now than was the case in the spring. ""Nevertheless, today's number represents 7.8% of people newly tested. That is obviously a real cause for concern, but it also underlines why we took very decisive and very tough action yesterday."" Many pub and restaurant owners have criticised plan to impose a 10pm curfew from Friday Ms Sturgeon also hinted that she would have taken tougher action on pubs than a 10pm curfew if she had ""the ability to  bring more financial firepower to mitigate the jobs and economic impact"". But Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross accused her of ""making the usual, tired political points"", adding: ""The middle of the pandemic is the wrong time to raise long-standing constitutional grievances."" The BBC understands UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking at options toreplace the furlough schemewhen it expires at the end of October. Ms Sturgeon had said at the end of June that she believed Scotland was ""not far away"" from eliminating the virus. On Wednesday, she said she could understand why many people felt like the country was now ""back to square one"" after the new nationwide restriction on visiting other homes was imposed. She said this was ""emphatically not the case"", despite the recent resurgence in cases. Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars The first minister said: ""For a start, the action we took to suppress the virus over the summer meant that we have faced this resurgence from a lower base. ""That matters, and it is entirely thanks to the lockdown restrictions and all of the individual sacrifices that everyone has made."" She said the rise in the number of cases was accelerating, but was still ""not as rapid"" as earlier in the year. A protest against the continuing closure of soft play facilities across Scotland was held outside the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday And she insisted that the country's test and protect contact tracing system was ""working well"" and was succeeding in breaking transmission chains. However, Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon said the system had struggled to cope when schools returned in August, and said there was still not enough routine testing in hospitals, care homes and schools. She also called for routine testing to be done in universities, adding: ""I think we have to be much more ambitious on testing in Scotland and right across the UK."" Ms Lennon said: ""We are still not testing enough. What we need to see in the coming days and weeks is mass testing being rolled out. ""We are in react mode and we didn't have the foresight to put measures in place"". All 500 students at Parker House in Dundee are self-isolating Several universities across Scotland have been dealing with outbreaks of the virus in recent days - with500 students at a hall of residence in Dundeebeing told to self-isolate after a positive case and several suspected cases emerged. In a direct appeal to students, Ms Sturgeon said they must follow the rules on self-isolating if told to do so. And she said the government would not hesitate to toughen the rules for colleges and universities if necessary. It later emerged that124 students at the University of Glasgowhad tested positive since the start of term, with social interaction in Freshers Week thought to be largely to blame.

New name for Colston Hall music venue revealed,"The main sign bearing old name was removed from the building in June A famous music venue in Bristol named after slave trader Edward Colston has been given a new name. The Colston Hall will now be known as Bristol Beacon. Bristol Music Trust, which runs the venue, said it hoped the renaming would be ""a fresh start for the organisation and its place in the city"". The hall is near where a statue of the 17th Century slave trader wastorn down by protesters in Juneduring an anti-racism protest. The name was revealed at an event in the venue's foyer on Wednesday without a live audience due to Covid-19 restrictions. Bristol's city poet Vanessa Kisuule wrote a work to mark the occasion - captured in a short film - and the Bristol Beacon name was revealed for the first time in the last line of the poem. Louise Mitchell, chief executive of the trust, said Bristol Beacon would be ""a symbol of hope and community"". ""A focal point for music in the city. A gathering space, illuminating the way ahead. A place of welcome, warmth and light,"" she said. The news was welcomed by the city's elected mayor, who did attend the event. Marvin Rees said it was not the specific name that mattered ""but the fact the city has gone through a process to think about what it calls its iconic venues"". And deputy mayor Craig CheneyÂ said the renaming ""also runs in a parallel with the city conversation reflecting on our history and how this understanding can be represented in our future"".Â Â Bristolians took to social media to express their views, with one woman saying the name didnot give credit to what the venue is or does,external. Twitter user Mike Norman,externalcalled it a ""fantastic new name"" and a ""great moment for Bristol"". But Clive Wilkinson said the venue,externalhad ""had three years to come up with something that sounds like a local free newspaper"". And Westcountrybird was concerned a large percentage of Bristolians would either mock it or not use the new name. ""The rebranding has divided the city worse than the football IMHO,"" she said. The statue of Edward Colston was dragged through Bristol before being thrown into the harbour The trust said it had consulted with 4,000 people across the city about the new name and it had been endorsed by the board of trustees. The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Slave-linked Colston Society to close down 'Why Colston's statue had to come down' It added the venue was built 150 years after Colston's death in 1721 with no financial investment or direct link to the man or his wealth. Bosses originally announced in 2017 theyplanned to change the building's ""toxic"" name. The ""Colston Hall"" lettering wasphysically removed from the buildingeight days after the statue was toppled. Colston made his fortune through human suffering and between 1672 and 1689. In that period,ships were believed to have transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas.

Pressure mounts over replacement for furlough,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October. ""I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs throughout the winter,"" he tweeted. The move comes after a day of mounting pressure on the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is understood to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. At the same time,the Treasury said there would be no Budget this autumn. ""Now is not the right time to outline long-term plans - people want to see us focused on the here and now,"" it said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson was urged to act swiftly by Labour and SNP MPs to prevent what one called a ""tsunami of job losses"". And on Wednesday night, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government does not provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ends. In a televised response to yesterday's Prime Ministerial Broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" In a recording, filmed just before news broke that the chancellor will make an announcement tomorrow about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October, he said: ""There was nothing in the Prime Minister's statement last night to protect people's jobs, businesses or our town centres and high streets. The PM said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. The German ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme and its French equivalenthave attracted much attention in the UK from employers and trade unions alike, with both the CBI and the TUC in favour. They fear unemployment could spike when the furlough scheme ends, as firms struggle to keep workers on the payroll. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey called on the government to""stop and rethink"" the furlough scheme, although he did not back any particular alternative. Could the furlough scheme be extended? Julian Metcalfe, the boss of the Itsu restaurant chain and founder of Pret a Manger, said the PM needed to show leadership rather than ""spouting off some Churchillian nonsense that we'll make it through [the winter]"". Boris Johnson said the chancellor is working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions ""The repercussions of these six months, it's going to be devastating to so many people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""People in the hospitality industry, people in work in hotels and restaurants and takeaways and coffee shops - a great many are closing down. We're losing thousands upon thousands of jobs here. ""How long can this continue, this vague 'work from home'?"" Germany's Kurzarbeit: The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"": The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion: A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion: A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage. Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages While there are fears that the cost of a replacement furlough scheme could damage the economy further, others argue that continued government support for jobs is needed to stop unemployment surging from November. Advocates of a salary top-up scheme also point to the fact that both France and Germany have extended their schemes to run for the whole of next year. A short-time working programme could also be cheaper than the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of employees' wages up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has cost Â£39.3bn so far, while the Germans estimate that the bill for Kurzarbeit during the pandemic will reach â¬33.5bn (Â£31bn) by the end of 2021, although that naturally depends on the progress of the pandemic. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson came under pressure from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for more support for businesses going forwards ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. ""We have been saying it for months. When is the prime minister finally going to act?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford says the last thing that 61,000 at-risk Scottish workers want is a hug from Boris Johnson. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said 60,000 workers in Scotland faced being ""sold onto the scrapheap"" if the furlough scheme was not extended while Labour's Graham Morris said there was a risk of ""a tsunami of job losses in the pipeline within 38 days"". In response, the PM acknowledged many firms faced ""very difficult circumstances"" and although an ""indefinite extension"" of the furlough scheme was out of the question, further support was being worked on. ""That is why we are looking at a massive package of investment in jobs and growth in the short, medium and long term,"" he said. ""In addition to the package I set out yesterday, there will be creative and imaginative measures from the chancellor to help people through this crisis.""

'I have gone from 65 weddings to one',"People working in the wedding industry have spoken of their frustration at the continuing threat to their livelihoods. The latest guidelines for England, which were announced on Wednesday, reduce the number ofpeople allowed to attend weddings to 15 - down from 30. For those who provide services like photography and planning, the restrictions have been ""devastating"". One planner said she had gone from having 65 weddings in her diary, to just one. The government has published guidelines on how to have a''Covid-secure'' wedding in England,external, which includes keeping ceremonies as short as possible and not providing food or drink for those at the ceremony, ""unless required for the purposes of solemnisation"". Laura May says she has been very stressed and anxious PhotographerLaura May, who is based in Shropshire, said the further reduction in numbers had made it ""hard for couples to know what to do"". ""The announcement is a blow and many will feel upset, especially if they've started to plan a wedding with 30 people but now have to change it again,"" she said. ""But, small weddings can be super-gorgeous and intimate and be a true reflection of the couple, and can be an ideal way to get the legal bit done this year - so life doesn't have to be put on hold - with a view to having a party in the future to celebrate properly."" She has had just two weddings since they were allowed to resume - from 1 August - with restricted numbers. ""Some moved to later this year, but a lot have had to rearrange a second time which has been just as frustrating for them."" She began running her business full time four years ago, but did not qualify for the grants eligible for the self-employed and had to take out a bounce-back loan for support during the pandemic. As she charges per hour, covering smaller weddings will affect her income. What are the rules on weddings? 'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM Latest news from the West Midlands ""I've been very stressed, I've been sad, anxious for my couples, for my business,"" she said. The continuing restrictions also mean she is beginning to worry about next year. ""If there's still the guest restriction, it is going to be really tough for wedding suppliers to survive moving couples again,"" she said ""Couples will have to really consider if they want to get married or to move their date again. ""I have had couples say they will still pay this year but I have said no because I'd rather have the money knowing the wedding will be going ahead, rather than have to think I've got to give the money back. ""I imagine a lot of venues will have to close if people keep rescheduling,"" she said. Clair Simpson says she has lost thousands of pounds due to cancelled wedding fairs Staffordshire-based wedding plannerClair Simpsonsaid the guidelines were confusing. She had 65 weddings in her diary for this year, with the likelihood that more would book, but said she now has just one. ""It is really frustrating,"" she said. ""When you bear in mind you can go to the pub and have 30 people in a room - in a pub with two or three rooms you could have 60 to 90 people in the building - but at a wedding you can have 15 at most. ""They could have more people and still distance; maybe they could be looking at a restriction by the size of room rather than numbers."" Ms Simpson also runs wedding fairs, and said she had now lost out on business for two seasons because of the coronavirus restrictions. ""I can be earning Â£3,000 per season, but I have lost that twice over now,"" she said. ""Weddings-wise, I could be doing, if I am working at full capacity, in excess of three to four weddings a week."" Wedding planner Becca Grubb's own wedding is unlikely to go ahead due to the restrictions Becca Grubb, who set up the Shropshire Wedding Planner during lockdown, is herself due to marry in December. ""We were going to have the ceremony on 29 December then go to a local hotel for a meal for 30 people,"" she said. ""It was fine, seemed perfect, we were due to pay all deposits... but I don't think it can go ahead now. It is quite devastating."" She said she was also concerned about the long-term impact on the industry. ""I really feel for the wedding industry. I have friends who are photographers, florists who have all lost a year of business. It is heartbreaking. ""I don't think the industry will survive another summer like this. ""They can't make up the money lost from weddings next year as there are only so many you can do in a year."" Ms Grubb, who still works four days a week in HR, said she was ""lucky"" compared to other businesses. ""[The government] keep chopping and changing,"" she said. ""There is no certainty whatsoever. We are totally in the dark, which is stressful and anxiety-inducing in itself."" Manon Pauffin said working on smaller weddings was not as financially viable Manon Pauffin, a Brighton-based photographer, said: ""We are the forgotten industry. Most other industries have gone back to work but not us."" She normally tries to work about 20 ceremonies each year but said she had just one booking for a smaller wedding this year. ""As much as I love intimate weddings and elopements, it is not the same to get Â£300 for a job compared to Â£2,000,"" she said. ""It is always just as special and I will devote the same amount of energy and care, but from a business perspective it is difficult."" Mrs Pauffin already had a part-time job but has increased her shifts due to the uncertainty. She said the industry needed clear guidance on what will happen in 2021. ""For at least a couple of months now we've all known there wasn't going to be any weddings this year, not like before anyway, and that's fine - there's nothing we can do about that - but what we need is a clear plan for next year,"" she said. ""Up until now we've had to react to whatever the situation was and scramble to find solutions; what we need is to be able to prepare.

Scotland bans household visits,"People in Scotland cannot visit other households, unless they are exempt Indoor visits between households in Scotland are now banned until further notice. Exactly six months since the country was first put into lockdown in March, Scots are once again not allowed to welcome anyone else into their homes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people in Scotland to comply from Wednesday, with enforcement being introduced on Friday. Exemptions are in place for certain groups of people. Those living alone who form extended households, couples not living together and those who need childcare and tradespeople do not have to observe the indoor visiting restriction. Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland Families urged not to book overseas October breaks Children exempt from some outdoor restrictions The decision to limit interaction between households was based on evidence from the Test and Protect operation that indicated this was the main way the virus was spreading. The measure was already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring local authority areas where local lockdown restrictions began earlier this month. Now it has been extended across the whole of Scotland in a bid to get the virus under control before winter. Restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks. This video can not be played In a TV address, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the nation ""we will get through it"" Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday that social interaction between different households was a key driver of transmission and such restrictions were the best way of bringing down the R-number. Later, in a televised address to the nation, she said: ""By staying out of other people's houses for now, we give ourselves the best chance of bringing Covid back under control."" Nicola Sturgeon's television address in full Do not meet people from any other households in your home or another person's home socially, unless they are in your extended household. These rules also apply to children Children whose parents do not live in the same household can move between homes, as can non-cohabiting couples Very limited exemptions apply for childcare, and for tradespeople A maximum of six people from two households can meet in outdoor spaces You should limit as far as possible the total number of households you meet in a day Under-12s do not count towards the maximum number of households or number of people who can meet outdoors. Under-12s do not have to physically distance A maximum of six 12 to 17 year olds can meet in outdoor spaces, with no household limit. Physical distancing is still required A maximum of six people from two households can meet in public indoor spaces such as cafes, pubs and restaurants, subject to physical distancing rules. Children under 12 from those two households do not count towards the limits Indoor and outdoor gatherings in Scotland were restricted to six people from two households just two weeks ago. However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. During her televised statement, she said Scotland had to choose its priorities and those were saving lives and protecting health, keeping schools open and restarting NHS services. Pubs, like Sloans in Glasgow, will have to close at 22:00 from Friday She said: ""Never forget that humanity has come through even bigger challenges than this one. And though it doesn't feel like it now, this virus will pass. ""It won't last forever and one day, hopefully soon, we will be looking back on it, not living through it. ""If we stick with it - and, above all, if we stick together - we will get through it."" Further measures aimed at the hospitality industry will come into effect on Friday. All bars and restaurants will have to close at 22:00 in line with changes announced for England. The first minister also asked urged people in Scotland not to book travel overseas for the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"" and advised people not so share a car with anyone outside of their own household. She also said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker, or short period of nationwide lockdown, under review. Such restrictions could be timed to coincide with the October school holidays, if deemed necessary. The Scottish Secretary, Alister Jack, has said he does not agree with the ""one-size-fits all"" approach to a nationwide ban on household visits. Mr Jack told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmeon Wednesday that he supported the action taken by the UK government in imposing local lockdowns in parts of the north of England. He said: ""The R number is very high in certain parts of Scotland and very low in other parts of Scotland. ""I would feel very sorry for people in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, for instance, because there is very little prevalence of the virus up there. ""If you are an elderly person and you are lonely and not able to have visits, my sympathy goes out those people."" However, Mr Jack insisted he did not believe the ban had ""gone too far"" in parts of Scotland. He said: ""This is a devolved matter on health and it's a decision for the first minister. ""But it's the only part of the restrictions announced yesterday that we haven't agreed on across the UK.""

Could UK adopt German or French furlough scheme?,"Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages Unlike the UK, the Germans didn't have to invent a job support programme from scratch when the pandemic struck: they already had one oven-ready. While British companies were getting to grips with the novelty of furloughing workers at the government's expense, their German counterparts simply fell back on a tried and tested scheme. Now, while UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is insisting that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will not continue past October, Germany is extending its Kurzarbeit job subsidy measures until the end of 2021. At the same time, France is following Germany's example and expects to be doing so for a couple of years. Germany extends coronavirus top-up pay scheme How are other economies dealing with the downturn? MPs want furlough extended to minimise job losses In the UK, influential figures including former prime minister Gordon Brown are urging the government to bring in a German or French-style system after October. So what are the German and French schemes and how do they work? ""I'm very glad we have this system,"" says Dr Volker Verch, director of the Central Westphalian employers' federation. ""We would have lost many more jobs, in my region and across the country, if we didn't have this Kurzarbeit,"" he told the BBC. ""Obviously it all has to be paid for, but it's worth it in terms of social harmony."" When the British scheme began, it was based on paying workers to stay at home and do nothing. It was not until July that furloughed employees were able to go back to work part-time. However, the German system was always about short-time working - allowing employers to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job. The government pays workers a percentage of the money they would have got for working those lost hours. Rolls-Royce Power Systems employs 5,500 workers in Germany According to the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research, at the height of the pandemic, half of all German firms had at least some of their staff on the scheme. That includes Rolls-Royce Power Systems, a German engineering company owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings and specialising in power generation and propulsion systems. It employs 9,000 people worldwide, 5,500 of them in Germany. Chief executive Andreas Schell told the BBC that the company came relatively late to the Kurzarbeit scheme. ""When the crisis came, we were sitting on a good order book,"" he says. ""But we anticipated a reduction in orders, and we had less to do in the third quarter, so we had to adjust our capacity."" In June, the firm put 1,000 of its German employees on ""short-time working"". That rose to 1,800 in July, before falling back in August and September as workers went on holiday instead. ""It's a really good programme of support by the German government,"" says Mr Schell. ""Otherwise we would have suffered economically. But it also helps to mitigate the economic consequences for our employees. It offers flexibility to us as a company and that's a good thing."" Andreas Schell has nothing but praise for the Kurzarbeit scheme Kurzarbeit has a long pedigree, going back to the early 20th Century. However, it came to prominence during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when it is thought to have saved up to half a million jobs. Even in normal times, it can be used by companies undergoing restructuring or suffering from seasonal fluctuations in their business. But normally it lasts for only six months. During the pandemic, that has been increased to a maximum of 21 months, while the criteria have been changed to include more firms and workers. The percentage of lost wages paid by the government will also go up in stages, from the usual 60% to 80% after the first six months. In comparison with the UK's furlough scheme, the cost of Kurzarbeit seems relatively modest, perhaps reflecting its more limited scope. Berlin ploughed â¬23.5bn into bolstering the scheme at the start of the pandemic, then expanded it again in August, at an estimated cost of â¬10bn more, to run for all of next year. By contrast, the Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the UK's furlough scheme will have cost Â£60bn, about twice as much as the Germans are spending, by the time it ends in October. The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. It too is designed to subsidise the jobs of people on reduced working hours - and it's also intended for the long haul. Under the French scheme, firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The scheme is subject to all kinds of French bureaucracy, requiring firms to come to an agreement with unions and offer formal guarantees of job security, but the principle is the same as in Germany. CIC Orio is a specialist industrial firm Olivier Six is chief executive of two very different firms, both based in the Grenoble area. The bigger of the two, CIC Orio, is a metallurgy company that employs 150 people making industrial boilers and other specialised equipment. The other, G-Tech Guidetti, specialises in making hiking accessories. ""When the crisis began, there was a loss of confidence,"" he told the BBC. ""Firms were sitting on their funds, nobody was paying anybody."" G-Tech Guidetti, as a consumer-facing firm, was immediately hit by the lockdown, because all its stockists had to close, so all its 15 employees went on the partial activity scheme. ""But after confinement ended, there was a pick-up in consumption and the recovery was very strong,"" he says. CIC Orio, however, is still making use of the scheme. Its employees are currently working four days out of five, with the government compensating them for the lost day's earnings. ""It's fortunate that we have this scheme, because we're afraid that the crisis will come back again,"" he says. ""This will last a long time. There will probably be another year of very weak economic activity."" The French government describes its scheme as a ""bouclier anti-licenciements,external"" - that is, an anti-redundancy shield. For now, it appears to be working. But with cases of coronavirus on the rise again in France, it's anyone's guess how long it might be needed.

Pressure mounts over replacement for furloughOptions to replace the furlough scheme are understood to include a German-style wage top-up system.BusinessComments,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October. ""I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs throughout the winter,"" he tweeted. The move comes after a day of mounting pressure on the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is understood to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. At the same time,the Treasury said there would be no Budget this autumn. ""Now is not the right time to outline long-term plans - people want to see us focused on the here and now,"" it said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson was urged to act swiftly by Labour and SNP MPs to prevent what one called a ""tsunami of job losses"". And on Wednesday night, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government does not provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ends. In a televised response to yesterday's Prime Ministerial Broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" In a recording, filmed just before news broke that the chancellor will make an announcement tomorrow about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October, he said: ""There was nothing in the Prime Minister's statement last night to protect people's jobs, businesses or our town centres and high streets. The PM said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. The German ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme and its French equivalenthave attracted much attention in the UK from employers and trade unions alike, with both the CBI and the TUC in favour. They fear unemployment could spike when the furlough scheme ends, as firms struggle to keep workers on the payroll. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey called on the government to""stop and rethink"" the furlough scheme, although he did not back any particular alternative. Could the furlough scheme be extended? Julian Metcalfe, the boss of the Itsu restaurant chain and founder of Pret a Manger, said the PM needed to show leadership rather than ""spouting off some Churchillian nonsense that we'll make it through [the winter]"". Boris Johnson said the chancellor is working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions ""The repercussions of these six months, it's going to be devastating to so many people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""People in the hospitality industry, people in work in hotels and restaurants and takeaways and coffee shops - a great many are closing down. We're losing thousands upon thousands of jobs here. ""How long can this continue, this vague 'work from home'?"" Germany's Kurzarbeit: The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"": The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion: A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion: A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage. Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages While there are fears that the cost of a replacement furlough scheme could damage the economy further, others argue that continued government support for jobs is needed to stop unemployment surging from November. Advocates of a salary top-up scheme also point to the fact that both France and Germany have extended their schemes to run for the whole of next year. A short-time working programme could also be cheaper than the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of employees' wages up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has cost Â£39.3bn so far, while the Germans estimate that the bill for Kurzarbeit during the pandemic will reach â¬33.5bn (Â£31bn) by the end of 2021, although that naturally depends on the progress of the pandemic. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson came under pressure from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for more support for businesses going forwards ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. ""We have been saying it for months. When is the prime minister finally going to act?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford says the last thing that 61,000 at-risk Scottish workers want is a hug from Boris Johnson. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said 60,000 workers in Scotland faced being ""sold onto the scrapheap"" if the furlough scheme was not extended while Labour's Graham Morris said there was a risk of ""a tsunami of job losses in the pipeline within 38 days"". In response, the PM acknowledged many firms faced ""very difficult circumstances"" and although an ""indefinite extension"" of the furlough scheme was out of the question, further support was being worked on. ""That is why we are looking at a massive package of investment in jobs and growth in the short, medium and long term,"" he said. ""In addition to the package I set out yesterday, there will be creative and imaginative measures from the chancellor to help people through this crisis.""

Poisoned Navalny discharged from Berlin hospital,"Alexei Navalny shared a picture of himself looking gaunt and thin but standing unaided Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been discharged from a Berlin hospital where he was being treated for Novichok nerve agent poisoning. The CharitÃ© Hospital said it was ending acute medical care because his condition had sufficiently improved. Mr Navalny posted a picture of himself standing unaided with a message saying doctors had given him every chance of a full recovery. His team alleges he was poisoned on the orders of President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin strongly denies any involvement. Mr Navalny, a leading Russian opposition activist, collapsed on a flight in Siberia on 20 August. He was later transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in the German capital. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? On Wednesday, his spokeswoman said he would remain in Germany ""because his treatment is not over"". ""Nevertheless, doctors now predict [a] full recovery,"" she added. A statement from the hospital said that 44-year-old Mr Navalny had spent 32 days there, including 24 days in intensive care. ""Based on the patient's progress and current condition, the treating physicians believe that complete recovery is possible. However, it remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Shortly after he was discharged,Mr Navalny described his rehabilitation programme in a post on Instagram,external. ""Further recovery does not require in-patient care, but a normal life,"" he wrote. ""Walking, spending time with my family. Immersing myself in a daily routine."" ""My plans are simple: (go to) the physiotherapist every day,"" he said. ""Possibly a rehabilitation centre. Stand on one leg. Regain complete control over my fingers. Maintain my balance."" Navalny described his recovery on Instagram He thanked doctors at the Berlin hospital for the treatment he had received. Earlier this month the hospital revealed that Mr Navalny had begun to recover, saying that he had been removed from a ventilator and could leave his bed. At the time, the German government said that laboratories in France and Sweden had reconfirmed German tests showing that the poison used on Mr Navalny was a Novichok agent. The Kremlin has said there is no proof of that. And in a statement on Wednesday, a Kremlin spokesman said Mr Navalny was ""free"" to return to Moscow ""at any moment"". The spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also wished the opposition figure ""a speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny's supporters initially believed that his tea had been spiked at Tomsk airport in Siberia before he caught a flight to Moscow. However, they later said thattraces of the nerve agent had been found on a water bottlein the hotel room where he had been staying. Mr Navalny became ill during the flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. Mr Navalny, in a coma, was flown to Berlin on an emergency flight from Omsk After tests confirmed poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent, the EU demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" a statement read. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the poisoning as ""outrageous"". In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Mr Navalny rubbished suggestions - purportedly from President Putin - that he had poisoned himself. French newspaper Le Monde reported that in a telephone call with President Emmanuel Macron on 14 September, Mr Putin had spoken ""with contempt about Alexei Navalny, considering him a simple internet troublemaker who had simulated diseases in the past"". ""Putin has outsmarted me,"" Mr Navalny wrote on Instagram, mocking the Russian president. ""He is nobody's fool. As a result, I, like a fool, spent 18 days in a coma but failed to achieve what I wanted. The provocation has failed!"" Alexei Navalny and his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, were pictured at the hospital in Berlin Western politicians are still undecided over their response to the poisoning, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. However, Mr Navalny's discharge from hospital will intensify pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel who has demanded - so far in vain - a full explanation from the Kremlin, she adds. A nerve agent from the Novichok group was also used to poison Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England in 2018. They both survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Twenty countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Moscow denied any involvement.

"Brexit letter warns of 7,000-truck queues in Kent","Truck drivers will need a permit to enter Kent after the Brexit transition period ends, the government has said. The announcement comes after a letter from cabinet minister Michael Gove warned that queues 7,000-trucks-long could clog up roads around the port of Dover and Channel Tunnel. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said the Kent Access Permit system would be enforced by police and ANPR cameras. It is intended to ensure drivers have all the paperwork they need, he said. Drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to apply for the permits online and show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for no-deal planning, wrote to logistics groups with the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" planning for when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union rules on 1 January. In that scenario, he said just half of big businesses and 20% of small businesses would be ready for the strict application of new EU requirements at the border. ""In those circumstances that could mean between only 30% and 60% of laden HGVs would arrive at the border with the necessary formalities completed for the goods on board,"" he told MPs. ""They'd therefore be turned back by the French border authorities, clogging the Dover to Calais crossing."" He said it could lead to delays of up to two days for drivers waiting to cross the Channel. Although he said those queues were likely to subside after businesses learned from seeing their cargo denied access to the continent. The transition period is due to expire at the end of the year but only a quarter of businesses are ""fully ready"" for the post-Brexit arrangements, Mr Gove said. Imports will also be disrupted in January, according to the letter sent to the freight industry by Mr Gove. It also raises the prospect of a winter spike in Covid-19 leading to absences of port and border staff. Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said: ""It is incredible that ministers are only now admitting to their plans to arrest British truckers for entering Kent without new travel passports. With just over three months to go, how are businesses meant to prepare amid this Conservative carnival of incompetence?'"" What is the Brexit transition period? How many trade deals has the UK done? What do I need to know about Brexit now? A simple guide The picture of chaos at the border might be familiar from a similar set of projections made for no-deal Brexit a year ago as part of what was known as Operation Yellowhammer. The government says this is not a prediction but an illustration of what could be reasonably expected. Moreover, Mr Gove told parliament on Wednesday the government was ""absolutely determined to do everything that we can to secure a deal"". According to the Cabinet Office document, without a free trade deal and in its reasonable worst-case scenario, there may be ""maximum queues of 7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days"". ""Both imports and exports could be disrupted to a similar extent,"" it says. The EU is expected to impose full goods controls on the UK, stopping all freight without the correct documentation at the end of the transition period on 1 January. The disruption is assumed to build in the first two weeks of January, and could last three months, or longer should France rigorously apply Schengen passport checks on hauliers at Dover and the Channel Tunnel. Brexit jargon explained The purpose of this stark communication is to try to get traders to act now to get ready for new border formalities that could help mitigate the disruption. Mr Gove told the industry that this needs to happen irrespective of whether or not there is a deal in the UK-EU trade negotiations. In response the freight industry says putting in place the measures needed to avoid border delays will be ""a huge challenge for government and industry"". Logistics UK, representing road, rail, sea and air haulage firms says it is urging businesses to quickly install and understand the new processes they will need to use. But firms need early access to both UK and EU systems so that they can conduct testing and training before 1 January, it says. A recent meeting between the industry and government was described as a ""washout"", with insiders describing the relationship as ""fraught"" and hauliers fearful that they were being cast as the ""fall guys"" for delays and disruption likely in January. There are further issues should there be no trade deal agreed. Hauliers would have to rely on special permits rationed by the Department for Transport, though a mutually beneficial deal here is possible. But discussions on these issues await settlement of the impasse in negotiations on state aid and fisheries. This video can not be played The government is ""not pointing the finger"" at hauliers, Michael Gove told the BBC Industry sources have raised the possibility that the UK would have to sign up to EU rules limiting driver hours, in order to get access to EU roads. And there is a specific new reference to France imposing strict passport checks at the ""juxtaposed controls"" currently designed to offer seamless travel across the Channel. ""There also remains a risk of continuing disruption caused by Schengen controls being applied rigorously at the juxtaposed controls at the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel,"" the document says.

Do join us again next week. BBC Politics The Prime Minister defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Labour Leader Sir
Keir Starmer accused the prime minister ofâlosing control of testingâ,externaland
âlosing control of the virusâ. He said the prime minister wasâreally out of touchâ with what parents were experiencing,externalwhen trying to get coronavirus tests for their children. The prime minister said it was an âepidemical factâ that the virus spreads person to person and that testing capacity was at âat a record highâ. He said Sir Keir should stop knocking the testing regime âfrom the side linesâ as it was important to âencourage people to believe in it.â Both the Labour leader and theSNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford,externalcalled on the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond October. Ian Blackford said workers
were âfacing the dogsâ if the scheme wasnât extended. And Labour
backbencher Grahame Morris said there would be a âtsunami of job lossesâ
if a targeted expansion wasnât brought it. Mr Johnson said the government would âbring forward
creative and imaginative schemes to keep the economy goingâ and âkeep them in
workâ. He said the âessenceâ of what the government was doing was to
âdepress the virus, keep pupils in school, keep economy goingâ Reality Check The PM said that testing capacity was ""at a record high"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that
âwe're going to go up to 500,000 tests by the end of Octoberâ. The testing target the government has
actually set is for the âcapacityâ to do 500,000 tests a day by that date. Capacity measures the number of tests labs
are able to process in a given day. However, they have never actually processed
that many tests. For example, labs currently have capacity
to process 264,000 tests a day, but in the most recent week - on average -
228,000 tests were processed. This means there was a 36,000 gap between testing
capacity and tests processed. The government has previously confirmed
that the 500,000 target relates to swab tests to see if you currently have the
virus, normally referred to as Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 testing. With capacity at its current level, the
target would see it almost double in just over a month. It took roughly three and a half months to
double it to its current levels. Ellie PricePolitical Correspondent This PMQs really highlights the
challenge facing the government with its handling of the countryâs health
versus its wealth. Boris Johnson was asked repeatedly by
Labour and SNP MPs about whether the government would consider extending the
job retention scheme. But he was asked too by some of his own MPs about whether
the government would be able to do anything to help football clubs, the
performing arts, and freelancers. The list, of course, goes on for
sectors that will be affected by six more months of tighter restrictions. And
their voices will only get louder. We wonât have any idea if these new
measures are working to reduce transmission rates for weeks to come. House of CommonsParliament The final question of PMQs comes from the DUP's Sammy Wilson. He says ""only time will tell""whether predictions made by the government's science advisers earlier this week""have any credibility or whether they are exaggerated"". But he claims the ""scare tactics being used and regulatory actions taken will have an immediate impact on high streets, the hospitality industry, and cause further devastation for aviation."" He asks the PM to promise continued support for businesses and devolved administrations during the crisis. Johnson says the MP made ""a powerful point of scepticism about the medical forecasts"". But he adds: ""All I can say is everyone should look at what has already happened... and be in no doubt such a thing can happen again."" Repeating one last time that a ""stitch in time saves nine"", the PM concludes there will be ""far more damage if we fail to control the virus now"". Ellie PricePolitical Correspondent Several questions about the pressures on football clubs
big and small. Restrictions announced last night meant the plans to allow fans
back to stadiums in October have been postponed, probably for the next 6
months. The prime pinister said the Secretary of State for Culture and Sport
Oliver Dowden is actively consulting with clubs on what the government can do
to help, so we can perhaps expect more news on this. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Several MPs have asked the prime minister about an extension to the furlough scheme. Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, said: ""The prime minister must announce an immediate extension... to this vital and life-saving scheme."" The furlough scheme was designed to protect jobs while businesses were unable to function. Initially, the government paid 80% of an employeeâs salary up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Now, employers have to pay 10% of the salary as well as national insurance and pension contributions. The scheme ends on 31 October. As of 20 September,a total of 9.6 million employees had been furloughed at some point by 1.2 million employers at a cost of Â£39.3bn,external. You canread more about the scheme here. House of CommonsParliament Former actor turned Tory MP Giles Watling makes a plea for the arts. He says the UK sector is a ""global gold standard and a vital showcase"" of what the country offers. But he says freelancers, such as actors and costumiers, have ""fallen through the cracks"" and need help from the government. Johnson says they have already given Â£1.57bn to support the creative industries. ""We will do whatever we can to support the freelancers,"" he adds. ""They are the backbone of our theatrical world which, as he knows, is the jewel in the crown of the London cultural economy."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Siobhain McDonagh says during lockdown a quarter of children on free school meals did  ""less than one hour of school work a day"". ""Lockdown was temporary but the impact could be lifelong,"" she says and urges the prime minister to support her bill which would give children on free school meals access to internet in their homes. ""She is raising a very important point,"" the prime minister replies and says the government is investing ""massively"" in online education to close ""the digital divide"". House of CommonsParliament Joining question time via video link, Labour's Florence Eshalomi raises the issue of unsafe cladding on buildings leaving people in her London consituency of Vauxhallunable to sell or remortgage properties. It is an issue seen across the country in light of the horror of the Grenfell Tower fire. She says people are being ""trapped between risk adverse lenders and irresponsible building owners"", and wants to know how the PM plans to ""resolve this dangerous situation"". Johnson says he is aware of the problem, calling it ""disgraceful"". He says the cladding ""should come off as fast as it can"" and the government was ""investing massively"" to make it happen. House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Wild tells MPs that he was at Norwich City Football Club at the weekend, as part of a pilot to let fans back into grounds. He says it is ""disappointing"" the return of fans has been postponed as many teams are ""facing a real threat to their viability"", and he urges the PM to consider a sports recovery fund. ""It grieves me to see football clubs not able to go back in the way they want to,"" Boris Johnson replies. ""I really wish we did not have to do this now,"" he says adding that his government is looking at solutions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patrick Grady will not let go of the furlough issue. He tells the PM the government will be hit with the cost either way ""whether they extend the job retention scheme or pay the long term price of long term unemployment"". He asks: ""Which of those is it going to be?"" Johnson says his government will ""intensify our support for every part of the union - from space ports to backing our armed services"", but again does not give a furlough pledge. Reality Check Boris Johnson said at Prime Ministerâs Questions: âweâre now testing more than any other country in Europeâ. Heâs made the Europe comparison many times before. Direct comparisons between countries on testing can be tricky, as countries donât report their figures at the same time and there may be some differences in methodology. But, in terms of overall tests to diagnose whether someone has coronavirus, heâs right â according to data collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Between 9 March and 6 September, its figures show:  On testing relative to the size of a country's population, the UK ranks highly (over the same period): UK did 246 tests for every 1,000 people compared with Germany which tested 160 per 1,000. A handful of countries tested more though â including Denmark with 459 tests per 1,000. Weâve looked at the comparisonsin more detail here. House of CommonsParliament Green Party MP Caroline Lucas points to a report from the RSPB, saying there had been a ""lost decade for nature"", with the government failing to reach 17 out of 20 targets it had signed up to. She says it is a ""vital moment to put this right and show some real leadership"". Lucas asks the PM to sign up to a new pledge, protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030. Johnson says she ""simply cannot be unaware the campaign to get the world's leaders to sign up to a leaders declaration was led by this government"". He says they will continue to campaign on biodiversity, adding: ""We will put in the funding."" Ellie PricePolitical Correspondent Keir Starmer used his last
questions to ask about economic support, particularly the continuation of the
furlough scheme for certain sectors. The calls that are
getting louder from lots of different voices, including the Governor of the
Bank of England, the trade unions, and big and small business groups, and - as we saw with Ian Blackford's question too - other
parties like the SNP. House of CommonsParliament Picking up where Keir Starmer left off, SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford also urges the PM to extend the furlough scheme, adding that ""one million jobs could be at risk if furlough ends early."" ""If those numbers become a reality the prime minister is leading us into another winter of discontent,"" he says. Boris Johnson repeats his earlier assertion that the government ""will come up with the appropriate and imaginative schemes to keep the economy moving"". ""That is so poor,"" replies Mr Blackford and again calls on the PM to extend furlough and ""stop one million workers being sold on to the scrap heap."" Mr Johnson says his government wants to ""get people into work while suppressing the virus"". Ellie PricePolitical Correspondent No surprises the first
few questions from Keir Starmer are about the government's handling of the test
and trace system. It's becoming a weekly feature and it's seen as a weakness
for the government. But don't forget Labour broadly back the tightening of restrictions -
so no major criticism there. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sunak weighs up new worker pay subsidy scheme,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October. ""I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs throughout the winter,"" he tweeted. The move comes after a day of mounting pressure on the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is understood to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. At the same time,the Treasury said there would be no Budget this autumn. ""Now is not the right time to outline long-term plans - people want to see us focused on the here and now,"" it said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson was urged to act swiftly by Labour and SNP MPs to prevent what one called a ""tsunami of job losses"". And on Wednesday night, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government does not provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ends. In a televised response to yesterday's Prime Ministerial Broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" In a recording, filmed just before news broke that the chancellor will make an announcement tomorrow about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October, he said: ""There was nothing in the Prime Minister's statement last night to protect people's jobs, businesses or our town centres and high streets. The PM said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. The German ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme and its French equivalenthave attracted much attention in the UK from employers and trade unions alike, with both the CBI and the TUC in favour. They fear unemployment could spike when the furlough scheme ends, as firms struggle to keep workers on the payroll. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey called on the government to""stop and rethink"" the furlough scheme, although he did not back any particular alternative. Could the furlough scheme be extended? Julian Metcalfe, the boss of the Itsu restaurant chain and founder of Pret a Manger, said the PM needed to show leadership rather than ""spouting off some Churchillian nonsense that we'll make it through [the winter]"". Boris Johnson said the chancellor is working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions ""The repercussions of these six months, it's going to be devastating to so many people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""People in the hospitality industry, people in work in hotels and restaurants and takeaways and coffee shops - a great many are closing down. We're losing thousands upon thousands of jobs here. ""How long can this continue, this vague 'work from home'?"" Germany's Kurzarbeit: The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"": The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion: A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion: A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage. Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages While there are fears that the cost of a replacement furlough scheme could damage the economy further, others argue that continued government support for jobs is needed to stop unemployment surging from November. Advocates of a salary top-up scheme also point to the fact that both France and Germany have extended their schemes to run for the whole of next year. A short-time working programme could also be cheaper than the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of employees' wages up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has cost Â£39.3bn so far, while the Germans estimate that the bill for Kurzarbeit during the pandemic will reach â¬33.5bn (Â£31bn) by the end of 2021, although that naturally depends on the progress of the pandemic. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson came under pressure from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for more support for businesses going forwards ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. ""We have been saying it for months. When is the prime minister finally going to act?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford says the last thing that 61,000 at-risk Scottish workers want is a hug from Boris Johnson. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said 60,000 workers in Scotland faced being ""sold onto the scrapheap"" if the furlough scheme was not extended while Labour's Graham Morris said there was a risk of ""a tsunami of job losses in the pipeline within 38 days"". In response, the PM acknowledged many firms faced ""very difficult circumstances"" and although an ""indefinite extension"" of the furlough scheme was out of the question, further support was being worked on. ""That is why we are looking at a massive package of investment in jobs and growth in the short, medium and long term,"" he said. ""In addition to the package I set out yesterday, there will be creative and imaginative measures from the chancellor to help people through this crisis.""

Breaking|Breaking newsScotland records highest-ever number of virus casesA further 486 people have tested positive for coronavirus - the highest daily total since the outbreak began.Scotland,"Scotland recorded 486 new positive coronavirus tests which represented the biggest single day's number since mass testing began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the figures were concerning, and underlined why new restrictions had been imposed. But she acknowledged many more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak in mid-April. Ms Sturgeon said 224 of the new cases were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with 107 in Lanarkshire and 57 in Lothian. The number of positive tests was 103 higher than the figure recorded on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases in Scotland to 25,495. Latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland Ms Sturgeon said the number in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area included a ""significant"" outbreak at Glasgow University. Testing strategy has changedradically in Scotland since the peak of the outbreak and there is now widespread community testing, including near to university campuses. On 15 April, 1,209 people were tested, but six times that number were being tested by mid-September. From Wednesday, people across Scotland were banned from visiting other people's homes, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the virus risks ""spiralling out of control"" unless urgent action is taken. The move, which had already been in force in Glasgow and other areas of the west of Scotland, means the country has tougher coronavirus restrictions than England, where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. Scotland, like England, will also impose a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants from Friday - which the trade has warned could cost jobs and force some premises to close completely. Scotland is currently carrying out about 10 times more tests every day than it was at the height of the outbreak in April. Speaking at her daily briefing on Wednesday, the first minister said: ""The total number of positive cases reported yesterday was 486 - that is the highest number of positive cases we have ever recorded in a single day. ""It must be remembered that many more people are being tested now than was the case in the spring. ""Nevertheless, today's number represents 7.8% of people newly tested. That is obviously a real cause for concern, but it also underlines why we took very decisive and very tough action yesterday."" Many pub and restaurant owners have criticised plan to impose a 10pm curfew from Friday Ms Sturgeon also hinted that she would have taken tougher action on pubs than a 10pm curfew if she had ""the ability to  bring more financial firepower to mitigate the jobs and economic impact"". But Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross accused her of ""making the usual, tired political points"", adding: ""The middle of the pandemic is the wrong time to raise long-standing constitutional grievances."" The BBC understands UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking at options toreplace the furlough schemewhen it expires at the end of October. Ms Sturgeon had said at the end of June that she believed Scotland was ""not far away"" from eliminating the virus. On Wednesday, she said she could understand why many people felt like the country was now ""back to square one"" after the new nationwide restriction on visiting other homes was imposed. She said this was ""emphatically not the case"", despite the recent resurgence in cases. Curfew could be 'fatal blow' to some pubs and bars The first minister said: ""For a start, the action we took to suppress the virus over the summer meant that we have faced this resurgence from a lower base. ""That matters, and it is entirely thanks to the lockdown restrictions and all of the individual sacrifices that everyone has made."" She said the rise in the number of cases was accelerating, but was still ""not as rapid"" as earlier in the year. A protest against the continuing closure of soft play facilities across Scotland was held outside the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday And she insisted that the country's test and protect contact tracing system was ""working well"" and was succeeding in breaking transmission chains. However, Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon said the system had struggled to cope when schools returned in August, and said there was still not enough routine testing in hospitals, care homes and schools. She also called for routine testing to be done in universities, adding: ""I think we have to be much more ambitious on testing in Scotland and right across the UK."" Ms Lennon said: ""We are still not testing enough. What we need to see in the coming days and weeks is mass testing being rolled out. ""We are in react mode and we didn't have the foresight to put measures in place"". All 500 students at Parker House in Dundee are self-isolating Several universities across Scotland have been dealing with outbreaks of the virus in recent days - with500 students at a hall of residence in Dundeebeing told to self-isolate after a positive case and several suspected cases emerged. In a direct appeal to students, Ms Sturgeon said they must follow the rules on self-isolating if told to do so. And she said the government would not hesitate to toughen the rules for colleges and universities if necessary. It later emerged that124 students at the University of Glasgowhad tested positive since the start of term, with social interaction in Freshers Week thought to be largely to blame.

Hundreds of students told to self-isolate,"All 500 students at Parker House in Dundee are self-isolating Hundreds of students have been told to self-isolate after a suspected Covid-19 outbreak in a halls of residence. All 500 residents at Parker House in Dundee have been asked to quarantine until contact tracing is complete. A""significant"" outbreak at Glasgow Universityand a number of Aberdeen University students testing positive have also been confirmed. Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""really, really important"" that those affected followed advice on self-isolation. The first minister said: ""As we've seen in the past few days, Covid can spread very quickly in shared living settings and halls of residence. ""So please follow the rules on self-isolation. ""Please know that we appreciate the sacrifices you are making at this very important stage of your lives."" NHS Tayside is investigating three positive cases and a small number of suspected cases linked to Parker House. Close contacts of the positive case, who is a student of Abertay University, are being contacted. A total of 72 residents in Wavell House halls of residence in Aberdeen's Hillhead Student Village are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. They have been offered access to food and other supplies and affected areas are undergoing a deep clean. The university said it was aware of social gatherings outside the Hillhead Halls of Residence at the weekend, and that some students had been fined for breaching coronavirus guidelines. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" An Aberdeen University spokesperson said: ""We appreciate this will be an anxious time for many but the safety of our staff, student and wider community are paramount. ""At the same time, it is vital that we all work together to comply with the guidelines to help keep our community safe and mitigate the risk of further spread."" Glasgow University said it was also dealing with a number of virus cases in student residences. The students affected are self-isolating and are being supported to ensure they have access to food and other supplies, the university said. Students across Scotlandreturned to socially-distanced campusesearlier this month. What is self-isolation and who needs to do it? What can students expect at university? What can I expect when I go to university this year? Students across Scotland returned to socially-distanced campuses earlier this month Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney was asked about the student cases and the country's contact tracing system on the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland. He told the programme the Test and Protect system was ""working well"" and said more than 90% of the contacts of positive cases were currently being traced. Mr Swinney added: ""This is the highest of any country in the UK."" The deputy first minister also said some of the capacity for testing in Scotland had yet to be utilised.

Olivia was a ""loving child who liked to help people"" and had ""a smile which could cheer anyone up"", the court heard. Jane Tweddle's daughters said she was full of laughter and love The inquiry also heard from the three daughters of Jane Tweddle, 51, who was originally from Hartlepool. A statement from Isabelle, Harriet and Lily Taylor was read by their representative Adam Pater. They said their ""warrior"" mother made sure they grew up in a house ""full of laughter"" and she ""always knew how to brighten someone's day and make them feel loved"". The court heard Ms Tweddle loved to cook, had ""spontaneous ideas"" and anyone who spent ""even five minutes"" with her would be ""forever changed, and always for the better."" Ms Tweddle, a secondary school receptionist in Blackpool, was ""friendly and full of life"" and ""made for her job"", the inquiry heard. Her daughters said when they would ask her for the time their mother would reply: ""It's the time of your life - never forget it."" ""We'll hold on to that forever...we love you endlessly, now we all have an angel to call by name,"" they said. Ms Tweddle's mother Margaret Tweddle said what happened that night in Manchester was ""evil"" and ""we won't let evil win. Jane wouldn't want that"". ""Not a day goes by that I don't miss her smile, laughter and love of life,"" she said. In the final pen portrait of the inquiry Alison Howe's best friend Tracy Green read her own tributes and one from Ms Howe's mother, Sue Cann.

Alison Howe adored her family, the inquiry heard Ms Green said everyone thought their best friend was perfect but ""mine really was"". ""She made everyone laugh and smile, even when it wasn't appropriate."" The court heard ""talented musician"" Ms Howe had been close to her mother Sue and had lived on the same street. ""She would come over and stick her face on the window to let me know she was there - even when she knew it drove me mad, and she would walk through the door laughing,"" Ms Cann said. The pair would ""dare each other to do daft things"", go on shopping trips and spa weekends and were ""always laughing"", the court heard. Ms Cann said her daughter ""adored her family. Steven and the children were her everything"". Her death had left an ""unbelievable"" gaping hole, she said. ""We don't live anymore, we exist."" ""I still turn around when someone shouts Mum and it's like being stabbed in the heart"". The court was shown a video of Alison's husband, Steven Howe. He said he could not believe there was anybody as ""caring and well-liked"" as Alison who was ""fantastic inside and out"". The family was ""absolutely destroyed"", he said, and it was ""never going to get any easier"". The court heard Alison had become a mum to Stephen's four boys and had two daughters and ""couldn't have done a better job"". One of the children, Harry had written a poem from her ""super -six"". He said she was ""always the glue"" of the family and without her there would have been no laughs and no biscuits. ""So special, so wonderful, so beautiful and so true"", all six children would love her forever, he said.

Sunak 'weighs up new worker pay scheme',"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to make an announcement on Thursday about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October. ""I will update the House of Commons on our plans to continue protecting jobs throughout the winter,"" he tweeted. The move comes after a day of mounting pressure on the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is understood to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. At the same time,the Treasury said there would be no Budget this autumn. ""Now is not the right time to outline long-term plans - people want to see us focused on the here and now,"" it said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson was urged to act swiftly by Labour and SNP MPs to prevent what one called a ""tsunami of job losses"". And on Wednesday night, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned there could be a ""wave of job losses this winter"" if the government does not provide the right economic support when the furlough scheme ends. In a televised response to yesterday's Prime Ministerial Broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses."" In a recording, filmed just before news broke that the chancellor will make an announcement tomorrow about what happens after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October, he said: ""There was nothing in the Prime Minister's statement last night to protect people's jobs, businesses or our town centres and high streets. The PM said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. The German ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme and its French equivalenthave attracted much attention in the UK from employers and trade unions alike, with both the CBI and the TUC in favour. They fear unemployment could spike when the furlough scheme ends, as firms struggle to keep workers on the payroll. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey called on the government to""stop and rethink"" the furlough scheme, although he did not back any particular alternative. Could the furlough scheme be extended? Julian Metcalfe, the boss of the Itsu restaurant chain and founder of Pret a Manger, said the PM needed to show leadership rather than ""spouting off some Churchillian nonsense that we'll make it through [the winter]"". Boris Johnson said the chancellor is working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions ""The repercussions of these six months, it's going to be devastating to so many people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""People in the hospitality industry, people in work in hotels and restaurants and takeaways and coffee shops - a great many are closing down. We're losing thousands upon thousands of jobs here. ""How long can this continue, this vague 'work from home'?"" Germany's Kurzarbeit: The employer cuts workers' hours and the government pays them a percentage of the money they would have lost as a result. It is a long-established scheme, but it has been revised during the pandemic. It can now run for up to 21 months and the percentage of lost wages paid by the government can now be as high as 80%. France's ""chÃ´mage partiel"": The French scheme, known as ""partial unemployment"" or ""partial activity"", also pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Firms are allowed to cut employees' hours by up to 40% for up to three years. Employees still receive nearly all their normal salary, with the government paying a percentage of the cost. The CBI's suggestion: A wages top-up from the government should be available provided that employees can work at least 50% of their normal hours. The firm would pay the actual hours worked in full, but the employee would get paid for two-thirds of the lost hours, with the cost shared between the company and the Treasury. The subsidy would last up to a year. The TUC's suggestion: A more generous version of the above. Employees could work a smaller proportion of their normal hours and still be eligible, while they would be guaranteed 80% pay for the hours lost, or 100% if they are on minimum wage. Mercedes and other German carmakers have used government money to subsidise wages While there are fears that the cost of a replacement furlough scheme could damage the economy further, others argue that continued government support for jobs is needed to stop unemployment surging from November. Advocates of a salary top-up scheme also point to the fact that both France and Germany have extended their schemes to run for the whole of next year. A short-time working programme could also be cheaper than the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of employees' wages up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. That scheme has cost Â£39.3bn so far, while the Germans estimate that the bill for Kurzarbeit during the pandemic will reach â¬33.5bn (Â£31bn) by the end of 2021, although that naturally depends on the progress of the pandemic. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson came under pressure from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity. Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for more support for businesses going forwards ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. ""We have been saying it for months. When is the prime minister finally going to act?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford says the last thing that 61,000 at-risk Scottish workers want is a hug from Boris Johnson. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said 60,000 workers in Scotland faced being ""sold onto the scrapheap"" if the furlough scheme was not extended while Labour's Graham Morris said there was a risk of ""a tsunami of job losses in the pipeline within 38 days"". In response, the PM acknowledged many firms faced ""very difficult circumstances"" and although an ""indefinite extension"" of the furlough scheme was out of the question, further support was being worked on. ""That is why we are looking at a massive package of investment in jobs and growth in the short, medium and long term,"" he said. ""In addition to the package I set out yesterday, there will be creative and imaginative measures from the chancellor to help people through this crisis.""

Musk: Cheaper Tesla ready 'in about three years',"Tesla founder Elon Musk has announced technology that he says will make Tesla batteries cheaper and more powerful. At a live presentation that Mr Musk labelled 'Battery Day' he also teased the possibility of a $25,000 (Â£19,600), fully-autonomous Tesla ""in about three years time"". ""This has always been our dream to make an affordable electric car,"" he said. But the news didn't excite investors and $50bn was wiped off its stock market value. The main announcement was Tesla's new larger cylindrical cells. It was claimed the new batteries will provide five times more energy, six times more power and 16% greater driving range. But the technology announced is likely to take years to implement. Tesla's approach includes integrating the battery so that it forms part of the structure of the vehicle, thereby reducing the effective weight of the battery. The speech took place in front of 240 shareholders - each sitting in a Tesla Model 3. Central to cheaper Teslas are innovations in the way the company designs batteries - radically improving their efficiency. Prof Stanley Whittingham - who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for his work on lithium-ion batteries - told the BBC that ""tackling all the opportunities is high risk, but high pay-off"". ""Many of us have suggested the same steps are necessary, but Tesla has the investment and will to make it happen. Not sure anyone else is willing to do this,"" he said. Mr Musk also announced that as well as purchasing batteries from Panasonic and LG Chem - Tesla itself would begin to make them. In April last year, Musk himself revealed problems with sourcing Panasonic batteries used in itsModel 3 Tesla.,external One expert said scaling up would be ""challenging"". ""Even with really experienced car manufacturers, we tend to see a very high scrap rate of production in the first couple of years,"" said Casper Rawles, head of price assessments at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Mr Rawles also warned that so much of the content of the battery is expensive metals - ""You can only reduce the cost down to a point"". Four consecutive quarters of growth have helped Tesla's share price soar and it is now the most valuable car company in the world. This is despite criticisms of Elon Musk that some of his technological advances have been exaggerated. Earlier this month, customer group Consumer Reports released a damning report about Tesla's automated driving services. The research concluded that""for now, full self-driving capabilityâ¦ remains a misnomer"".,external And in July, Mr Musk said Tesla would be able to make its vehicles completely autonomous by theend of this year. The statement was met with scepticism by industry insiders. Tesla's boss however announced that a ""beta"" version of the full Autopilot software would be available ""in a month or so"". Musk is no stranger to glitzy and sometimes bizarre public demonstrations. Earlier this month he unveiled apig with a coin-sized computer chip in its brainto demonstrate his ambitious plans to create a working brain-to-machine interface.

Hate crime laws 'should protect' women,"This video can not be played Stella Creasy: Treat misogyny like racism or homophobia Women should be protected under expanded hate crime laws, according to a new report from the Law Commission. The independent body that advises government said misogyny should be treated in the same way as other discrimination when it is the motivation for a crime. Campaigners welcomed the proposal, including Labour MP Stella Creasy, who called it ""our moment for change"". The Home Office said it was ""committed to stamping out hate crime"". Seven police forces in England and Wales class misogyny as a hate crime, but this definition has not been adopted across the board. When a crime is carried out against someone - such as assault, harassment or criminal damage - because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, it is considered a hate crime and treated more seriously by the courts. But campaigners have criticised the complex nature of the existing laws, and called for sex and gender to be added to the list. Misogyny should be treated as a hate crime, say MPs Hate crimes recorded by police up 10% Homophobic hate crime charges fall as reports soar The Law Commission has carried out a review into the legislation and is putting several recommendations into a consultation. It said the ""vast majority of evidence"" suggested crimes were linked to misogyny. The commission plans to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021. The Home Office said it asked the commission to ""explore how to make current legislation more effective, and if there should be additional protective characteristics"" - and it will ""respond to the review in full when it is complete"". This video can not be played 'He said I couldn't take a compliment' The commissioner for criminal law, Professor Penney Lewis, said: ""Hate crime has no place in our society and we have seen the terrible impact that it can have on victims. ""Our proposals will ensure all protected characteristics are treated in the same way, and that women enjoy hate crime protection for the first time."" Campaign and policy manager at Women's Aid, Lucy Hadley, welcomed the proposals. She said: ""Sexism and women's inequality are the root causes of violence against women - including domestic abuse, sexual violence, street harassment including 'upskirting', and online forms of crime - and these often intersect with other identities, including race and ethnicity, sexuality and disability. ""Making clear that crimes happen to women 'because they are women' could help to send a clear message that women will be believed, protected and supported if they experience sexist violence and abuse."" Nadia - not her real name - is a survivor of domestic abuse, which she says was driven by the misogyny of her ex-partner. She said: ""When I did not want to be sexually intimate with my ex-partner, he behaved as if he was entitled because, in his eyes, I was someone with no value, worth or respect - I was an object. My only purpose was to serve him."" Nadia said her ex-partner ""felt entitled"" to abuse her as he was a man who saw himself as superior to her. ""My opinions and feelings had no value and my needs weren't important - his were, they always came first,"" she added. Although financially independent, Nadia was never allowed to pay for meals or her car, as another form of control. ""When we were on holiday, he insisted that only he could exchange the money for foreign currency, which meant I had to ask him for money,"" she said. ""He wanted me to give up work. ""It was apparently because he was doing the right thing as a man but really it was to increase my dependency and isolate me further."" Nadia added: ""He had a huge sense of entitlement because he was a man. There was constant superiority over me and disdain for my mind. ""I believe that misogyny suited him and justified his abusive behaviour."" Ms Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, has led calls for a change in the law andsecured the commission's review in 2018. She welcomed the findings, saying they would help the criminal justice system ""detect and prevent offences including sexual assault, rape and domestic abuse"". Ms Creasy added: ""I now urge every woman who has walked with keys in her hands at night, been abused or attacked online or offline to come forward and be heard in this consultation. ""This is our moment for change - rather than asking women to pick a side of their identity to be protected, it's time to send a message that women should be equally able to live free from fear of assault or harm targeted at them simply for who they are."" People are generally attacked because an assailant dislikes something about that person - their appearance, their views, the football team they support. What marks hate crime out is where the assailant says or does something that provides evidence they have targeted a person because of one of the five ""protected characteristics"". So hate crimes often involve assaults on public-facing officials - traffic wardens, store detectives, NHS staff - where in the course of the incident the perpetrator abuses the victim on grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. If sex and gender become protected characteristics in order to protect women, the same would apply. The perpetrator's actions, or more likely the words they use, would have to evidence that they are targeting the victim on grounds of sex/gender. The first force to introduce misogyny as a hate crime wasNottinghamshire Police in 2016. Chief Inspector Louise Clarke, who leads the hate crime unit at the force, said it had taken numerous actions against perpetrators - and even where there was not sufficient evidence to support a prosecution, officers had spoken to men about their behaviour and explained the consequences. She added: ""Ultimately, this is about giving women the ability and confidence to report this behaviour. ""Many men aren't even aware that this happens and are often shocked by the extent of the issues."" The issue wasdebated in Parliament's second debating chamber, Westminster Hall, in 2018,external. The then minister Victoria Atkins, replying to the debate, said the government needed to be careful when creating new laws that would ""would inadvertently conflict with principles of equality"". She said: ""Equality of protection is a crucial element of ensuring public support for hate crime legislation. ""In other words, if we were to have hate crime in relation to gender, we would have to think carefully about whether that would apply to the entire population or just to half of it."" The Law Commission is also currently consulting on whether ageism, being a member of an alternative subculture (like goths and punks), or homelessness should also be added to the list of hate crime motivations. It is also wants the ""stirring up hatred"" offence to be reformed, so it is less difficult to prosecute and gives equal footing to all the groups it affects. And it is recommending the extension of the offence of racist chanting at a football match to cover chanting based on sexual orientation.

Alexei Navalny discharged from Berlin hospital,"Alexei Navalny shared a picture of himself looking gaunt and thin but standing unaided Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been discharged from a Berlin hospital where he was being treated for Novichok nerve agent poisoning. The CharitÃ© Hospital said it was ending acute medical care because his condition had sufficiently improved. Mr Navalny posted a picture of himself standing unaided with a message saying doctors had given him every chance of a full recovery. His team alleges he was poisoned on the orders of President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin strongly denies any involvement. Mr Navalny, a leading Russian opposition activist, collapsed on a flight in Siberia on 20 August. He was later transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in the German capital. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? On Wednesday, his spokeswoman said he would remain in Germany ""because his treatment is not over"". ""Nevertheless, doctors now predict [a] full recovery,"" she added. A statement from the hospital said that 44-year-old Mr Navalny had spent 32 days there, including 24 days in intensive care. ""Based on the patient's progress and current condition, the treating physicians believe that complete recovery is possible. However, it remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Shortly after he was discharged,Mr Navalny described his rehabilitation programme in a post on Instagram,external. ""Further recovery does not require in-patient care, but a normal life,"" he wrote. ""Walking, spending time with my family. Immersing myself in a daily routine."" ""My plans are simple: (go to) the physiotherapist every day,"" he said. ""Possibly a rehabilitation centre. Stand on one leg. Regain complete control over my fingers. Maintain my balance."" Navalny described his recovery on Instagram He thanked doctors at the Berlin hospital for the treatment he had received. Earlier this month the hospital revealed that Mr Navalny had begun to recover, saying that he had been removed from a ventilator and could leave his bed. At the time, the German government said that laboratories in France and Sweden had reconfirmed German tests showing that the poison used on Mr Navalny was a Novichok agent. The Kremlin has said there is no proof of that. And in a statement on Wednesday, a Kremlin spokesman said Mr Navalny was ""free"" to return to Moscow ""at any moment"". The spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also wished the opposition figure ""a speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny's supporters initially believed that his tea had been spiked at Tomsk airport in Siberia before he caught a flight to Moscow. However, they later said thattraces of the nerve agent had been found on a water bottlein the hotel room where he had been staying. Mr Navalny became ill during the flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. Mr Navalny, in a coma, was flown to Berlin on an emergency flight from Omsk After tests confirmed poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent, the EU demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" a statement read. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the poisoning as ""outrageous"". In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Mr Navalny rubbished suggestions - purportedly from President Putin - that he had poisoned himself. French newspaper Le Monde reported that in a telephone call with President Emmanuel Macron on 14 September, Mr Putin had spoken ""with contempt about Alexei Navalny, considering him a simple internet troublemaker who had simulated diseases in the past"". ""Putin has outsmarted me,"" Mr Navalny wrote on Instagram, mocking the Russian president. ""He is nobody's fool. As a result, I, like a fool, spent 18 days in a coma but failed to achieve what I wanted. The provocation has failed!"" Alexei Navalny and his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, were pictured at the hospital in Berlin Western politicians are still undecided over their response to the poisoning, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. However, Mr Navalny's discharge from hospital will intensify pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel who has demanded - so far in vain - a full explanation from the Kremlin, she adds. A nerve agent from the Novichok group was also used to poison Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England in 2018. They both survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Twenty countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Moscow denied any involvement.

Those living alone who form extended households, couples not living together and those who need childcare and tradespeople do not have to observe the indoor visiting restriction. Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland Families urged not to book overseas October breaks Children exempt from some outdoor restrictions The decision to limit interaction between households was based on evidence from the Test and Protect operation that indicated this was the main way the virus was spreading. The measure was already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring local authority areas where local lockdown restrictions began earlier this month. Now it has been extended across the whole of Scotland in a bid to get the virus under control before winter. Restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks.

'We have to phone 15 people and uninvite them',"Tony and Laura have a daughter together and another baby on the way ""We have to phone 15 people and tell them they can't come any more, which is an absolute nightmare,"" says Tony Slade, who is due to get married to fiancee Laura next week. They had already limited their wedding guest list to fewer than 30, in line with the UK government's coronavirus restrictions in England. Now they face a further cull, asBoris Johnson announcedthe maximum number of people allowed at weddings is being cut to 15. ""More than likely we'll probably still go ahead with it,"" says Tony, from Edenbridge in Kent. ""It'll be Laura's family of six and my family of five."" The couple - who have been together for 10 years and have a daughter together - will ""have a long chat about what to do this evening"" and make a decision. ""I don't know how you can have pubs but you can't have weddings,"" he says. ""I understand there's certain things they've got to do but I don't think they're looking at it in the right way. ""You can sit in a Wetherspoons with 100 people back to back but you can't have more than 15 at a wedding, even spaced out."" He adds: ""I'm disappointed. Laura's done all the planning in record time. She had about six of her mates who were bridesmaids who can't come now. My best man and groomsmen can't come either."" What are the rules on weddings? The story of a socially distanced wedding New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines The new rules have not been published yet - but if they are similar tothe current regulations,,externalthe limit will have to include all attendees - including the registrar and suppliers such as photographers. Amy and her fiance Alan are also facing the prospect of having to send out another batch of ""uninvites"" to their wedding. The couple, who live in Cheltenham, originally cut down their wedding guest list of 100 to fewer than 30. ""Upset was the first feeling I had,"" says Amy, of the moment when Mr Johnson announced the rules. ""We had got very excited about our new plan which we just made about three weeks ago. To cut it down again is another blow."" Amy and fiance Alan did not want to be identified ""I don't understand how it fits with the other regulations,"" she says. ""Maybe I can understand them cutting down the reception, but the ceremony as well? Why does that have to be 15 when a church service can have as many as they want?"" Under the current rules,,externalplaces of worship can decide their own limits for services - but not weddings - depending on how many people can safely fit inside while social distancing. With her wedding in one month's time, on 23 October, Amy, 35, who is a teacher, isn't sure what she and her fiance will do, and says they will discuss it properly before deciding. ""People have booked their travel,"" she says, with some guests due to travel from Northern Ireland. ""That's the problem."" Some couples are determined to go ahead with their plans despite the new limit, not wanting to put their lives on hold. ""We just want to get married,"" says James Hoggarth, a chartered accountant from Leamington Spa, who has been engaged to fiancee Lindsay for two years. ""We have already got one child, we want to have another one at some point."" ""It is what it is,"" says James - ""it is the hand that we have been dealt"" They originally had 110 guests planned for their wedding next month, which they then cut down to 30, and will now halve to 15. ""Cutting down the first time was difficult,"" he says. ""To then have to cut it again and have to cut out family is very hard. But it's what you have to do. ""It's difficult. It will almost certainly mean we will end up cutting aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. ""It will probably end up being that we end up with the three of us, two registrars and then very close family - parents, siblings, best man and maid of honour."" James adds: ""After the initial shock, I just want to get on with it,"" he says. ""It's not nice but it's unfortunately the world that we live in. We just want to have our day."" But it is not just couples who will be disappointed with the government's change to the rules on weddings. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector in Greater Manchester, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart-breaking"". The wedding industry has ""been completely, utterly decimated"", says Marc Gough ""I have moved nearly 300 weddings already from this year and then to put a restriction of up to 15 for six months, I now have to contact all the brides. We're then possibly going to have to give refunds. ""I can't go back to work, I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough said on BBC Radio 5 live. ""We can't make a living."" This video can not be played Beth Johnson and Phil Hobbs had to scale down their wedding day Mr Gough says that before the pandemic, his business Whitehouse Event Crockery had a turnover of Â£750,000. ""Now, I have probably turned over just Â£20,000. To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart-breaking."" Mr Gough says it is ""draining"" having to put a ""brave face on to my family, to business people, to my staff"", and called for more financial help from the government, including an extension to the furlough scheme which is due to end next month.

Nike expects permanent shift to online sales,"Sportswear firm Nike has seen a huge rise in online sales as it bounces back from a coronavirus slump. The US company saw digital sales rocket 82% during the June to August quarter, offsetting falling revenue in its stores. On Tuesday, Nike posted revenue of $10.6bn (Â£8.3bn) as many of its key markets recovered including China. For its previous quarter revenues were down by more than a third as it tackled store closures and lockdowns globally. Nike chief executive John Donahoe said the shift to online sales could be a permanent trend. ""We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,"" Mr Donahoe said. This video can not be played Mike Martin led the Guildford Heat to becoming one of the most successful teams in the UK Sales are growing in its major markets including China, Japan, South Korea and the UK, while its core North American market is declining. Nike's shares rose more than 10% in late trading in the US, as the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Nike turns to digital sales during China shutdown The $6bn surge sparked by an icon from 1985 A new way of living and dressing - BBC Culture Nike has been using its website and shopping apps to release limited edition footwear. The sportswear giant has been transforming itself to sell directly to customers over the past few years, reducing its store presence and retail partners. While many gyms have been closed during the pandemic, sportswear makers have reported strong demand for more casual attire as more people work and exercise at home. Rival Adidas said last month that it was seeing improving sales trends while yoga pants maker Lululemon posted a 157% jump in its online business. Like many other retailers, Nike is still limiting the number of people who can come into its stores at once to try to help curb the spread of the virus. But when people do visit, they're coming with the intent to buy, Nike said.

"Musk: Cheaper Tesla ready 'in about three years'Plans for lower-cost batteries and a $25,000 car did not excite investors - firm's value fell $50bn.Technology","Tesla founder Elon Musk has announced technology that he says will make Tesla batteries cheaper and more powerful. At a live presentation that Mr Musk labelled 'Battery Day' he also teased the possibility of a $25,000 (Â£19,600), fully-autonomous Tesla ""in about three years time"". ""This has always been our dream to make an affordable electric car,"" he said. But the news didn't excite investors and $50bn was wiped off its stock market value. The main announcement was Tesla's new larger cylindrical cells. It was claimed the new batteries will provide five times more energy, six times more power and 16% greater driving range. But the technology announced is likely to take years to implement. Tesla's approach includes integrating the battery so that it forms part of the structure of the vehicle, thereby reducing the effective weight of the battery. The speech took place in front of 240 shareholders - each sitting in a Tesla Model 3. Central to cheaper Teslas are innovations in the way the company designs batteries - radically improving their efficiency. Prof Stanley Whittingham - who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for his work on lithium-ion batteries - told the BBC that ""tackling all the opportunities is high risk, but high pay-off"". ""Many of us have suggested the same steps are necessary, but Tesla has the investment and will to make it happen. Not sure anyone else is willing to do this,"" he said. Mr Musk also announced that as well as purchasing batteries from Panasonic and LG Chem - Tesla itself would begin to make them. In April last year, Musk himself revealed problems with sourcing Panasonic batteries used in itsModel 3 Tesla.,external One expert said scaling up would be ""challenging"". ""Even with really experienced car manufacturers, we tend to see a very high scrap rate of production in the first couple of years,"" said Casper Rawles, head of price assessments at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Mr Rawles also warned that so much of the content of the battery is expensive metals - ""You can only reduce the cost down to a point"". Four consecutive quarters of growth have helped Tesla's share price soar and it is now the most valuable car company in the world. This is despite criticisms of Elon Musk that some of his technological advances have been exaggerated. Earlier this month, customer group Consumer Reports released a damning report about Tesla's automated driving services. The research concluded that""for now, full self-driving capabilityâ¦ remains a misnomer"".,external And in July, Mr Musk said Tesla would be able to make its vehicles completely autonomous by theend of this year. The statement was met with scepticism by industry insiders. Tesla's boss however announced that a ""beta"" version of the full Autopilot software would be available ""in a month or so"". Musk is no stranger to glitzy and sometimes bizarre public demonstrations. Earlier this month he unveiled apig with a coin-sized computer chip in its brainto demonstrate his ambitious plans to create a working brain-to-machine interface.

However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. During her televised statement, she said Scotland had to choose its priorities and those were saving lives and protecting health, keeping schools open and restarting NHS services. Pubs, like Sloans in Glasgow, will have to close at 22:00 from Friday She said: ""Never forget that humanity has come through even bigger challenges than this one. And though it doesn't feel like it now, this virus will pass. ""It won't last forever and one day, hopefully soon, we will be looking back on it, not living through it. ""If we stick with it - and, above all, if we stick together - we will get through it."" Further measures aimed at the hospitality industry will come into effect on Friday. All bars and restaurants will have to close at 22:00 in line with changes announced for England. The first minister also asked urged people in Scotland not to book travel overseas for the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"" and advised people not so share a car with anyone outside of their own household. She also said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker, or short period of nationwide lockdown, under review. Such restrictions could be timed to coincide with the October school holidays, if deemed necessary. The Scottish Secretary, Alister Jack, has said he does not agree with the ""one-size-fits all"" approach to a nationwide ban on household visits. Mr Jack told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programmeon Wednesday that he supported the action taken by the UK government in imposing local lockdowns in parts of the north of England. He said: ""The R number is very high in certain parts of Scotland and very low in other parts of Scotland. ""I would feel very sorry for people in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, for instance, because there is very little prevalence of the virus up there. ""If you are an elderly person and you are lonely and not able to have visits, my sympathy goes out those people."" However, Mr Jack insisted he did not believe the ban had ""gone too far"" in parts of Scotland. He said: ""This is a devolved matter on health and it's a decision for the first minister. ""But it's the only part of the restrictions announced yesterday that we haven't agreed on across the UK.""

Hate crime laws 'should protect' womenThe Law Commission recommends treating misogyny like other forms of discrimination.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Stella Creasy: Treat misogyny like racism or homophobia Women should be protected under expanded hate crime laws, according to a new report from the Law Commission. The independent body that advises government said misogyny should be treated in the same way as other discrimination when it is the motivation for a crime. Campaigners welcomed the proposal, including Labour MP Stella Creasy, who called it ""our moment for change"". The Home Office said it was ""committed to stamping out hate crime"". Seven police forces in England and Wales class misogyny as a hate crime, but this definition has not been adopted across the board. When a crime is carried out against someone - such as assault, harassment or criminal damage - because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, it is considered a hate crime and treated more seriously by the courts. But campaigners have criticised the complex nature of the existing laws, and called for sex and gender to be added to the list. Misogyny should be treated as a hate crime, say MPs Hate crimes recorded by police up 10% Homophobic hate crime charges fall as reports soar The Law Commission has carried out a review into the legislation and is putting several recommendations into a consultation. It said the ""vast majority of evidence"" suggested crimes were linked to misogyny. The commission plans to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021. The Home Office said it asked the commission to ""explore how to make current legislation more effective, and if there should be additional protective characteristics"" - and it will ""respond to the review in full when it is complete"". This video can not be played 'He said I couldn't take a compliment' The commissioner for criminal law, Professor Penney Lewis, said: ""Hate crime has no place in our society and we have seen the terrible impact that it can have on victims. ""Our proposals will ensure all protected characteristics are treated in the same way, and that women enjoy hate crime protection for the first time."" Campaign and policy manager at Women's Aid, Lucy Hadley, welcomed the proposals. She said: ""Sexism and women's inequality are the root causes of violence against women - including domestic abuse, sexual violence, street harassment including 'upskirting', and online forms of crime - and these often intersect with other identities, including race and ethnicity, sexuality and disability. ""Making clear that crimes happen to women 'because they are women' could help to send a clear message that women will be believed, protected and supported if they experience sexist violence and abuse."" Nadia - not her real name - is a survivor of domestic abuse, which she says was driven by the misogyny of her ex-partner. She said: ""When I did not want to be sexually intimate with my ex-partner, he behaved as if he was entitled because, in his eyes, I was someone with no value, worth or respect - I was an object. My only purpose was to serve him."" Nadia said her ex-partner ""felt entitled"" to abuse her as he was a man who saw himself as superior to her. ""My opinions and feelings had no value and my needs weren't important - his were, they always came first,"" she added. Although financially independent, Nadia was never allowed to pay for meals or her car, as another form of control. ""When we were on holiday, he insisted that only he could exchange the money for foreign currency, which meant I had to ask him for money,"" she said. ""He wanted me to give up work. ""It was apparently because he was doing the right thing as a man but really it was to increase my dependency and isolate me further."" Nadia added: ""He had a huge sense of entitlement because he was a man. There was constant superiority over me and disdain for my mind. ""I believe that misogyny suited him and justified his abusive behaviour."" Ms Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, has led calls for a change in the law andsecured the commission's review in 2018. She welcomed the findings, saying they would help the criminal justice system ""detect and prevent offences including sexual assault, rape and domestic abuse"". Ms Creasy added: ""I now urge every woman who has walked with keys in her hands at night, been abused or attacked online or offline to come forward and be heard in this consultation. ""This is our moment for change - rather than asking women to pick a side of their identity to be protected, it's time to send a message that women should be equally able to live free from fear of assault or harm targeted at them simply for who they are."" People are generally attacked because an assailant dislikes something about that person - their appearance, their views, the football team they support. What marks hate crime out is where the assailant says or does something that provides evidence they have targeted a person because of one of the five ""protected characteristics"". So hate crimes often involve assaults on public-facing officials - traffic wardens, store detectives, NHS staff - where in the course of the incident the perpetrator abuses the victim on grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. If sex and gender become protected characteristics in order to protect women, the same would apply. The perpetrator's actions, or more likely the words they use, would have to evidence that they are targeting the victim on grounds of sex/gender. The first force to introduce misogyny as a hate crime wasNottinghamshire Police in 2016. Chief Inspector Louise Clarke, who leads the hate crime unit at the force, said it had taken numerous actions against perpetrators - and even where there was not sufficient evidence to support a prosecution, officers had spoken to men about their behaviour and explained the consequences. She added: ""Ultimately, this is about giving women the ability and confidence to report this behaviour. ""Many men aren't even aware that this happens and are often shocked by the extent of the issues."" The issue wasdebated in Parliament's second debating chamber, Westminster Hall, in 2018,external. The then minister Victoria Atkins, replying to the debate, said the government needed to be careful when creating new laws that would ""would inadvertently conflict with principles of equality"". She said: ""Equality of protection is a crucial element of ensuring public support for hate crime legislation. ""In other words, if we were to have hate crime in relation to gender, we would have to think carefully about whether that would apply to the entire population or just to half of it."" The Law Commission is also currently consulting on whether ageism, being a member of an alternative subculture (like goths and punks), or homelessness should also be added to the list of hate crime motivations. It is also wants the ""stirring up hatred"" offence to be reformed, so it is less difficult to prosecute and gives equal footing to all the groups it affects. And it is recommending the extension of the offence of racist chanting at a football match to cover chanting based on sexual orientation.

Could churches double up as bank branches?,"Hay-on-Wye, home of a major book festival, is one area that will hold a trial A financial hub in a Methodist church and drop-and-go deposit points for small firms are among ideas being tested in cash-stricken communities. Local people will also have access to cashback from convenience stores - even if they do no shopping. Eight trials have been confirmed as part of a project to help solve problems with access to cash. The closure of bank branches and cash machines has led to losses for local firms and has concerned consumers. The plan for trials was drawn up in light ofa major report,externalwarning that the country is ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society. It concluded that eight million people in the UK rely on notes and coins, ranging from those without a bank account to people who are not comfortable with digital payments. The eight trial areas, including remote communities such as the village of Botton, North Yorkshire, will test a range of ideas including pop-up Post Offices in small shops, and banking hubs in retail spaces. Fifteen shops in four areas will trial the purchase-free cashback plan. Retailers will be remunerated for providing the service by payment services company PayPoint. Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' A new rural bank branch opening! What's going on? ""It is critical that we find ways to protect the viability of cash, for consumers and communities alike,"" said Natalie Ceeney, who wrote the access to cash report and is overseeing the projects.Â ""TheseÂ pilotsÂ are designed to find sustainable ways to keep cash viable locally, which, if successful, can then be rolled out more widely."" Reports on the progress, or otherwise, of the projects will be published in summer next year. Ms Ceeney said that access to cash machines was not the only answer, particularly for businesses that needed to quickly deposit their takings. She said firm shouldn't have to shut their doors during the day to drive to the nearest bank miles away in another town. Cash is vital to avoid overspending, says 20-year-old civil engineering apprentice Brandon Wilson Not long ago there were two banks with branches in Ampthill. Then there was one. Now there is none. Currently just one cash machine is left to serve a population of more than 8,000. Resident Brandon Wilson, 20, told the BBC in June that using cash helped him stick more rigidly to his spending plans to ensure he did not spend beyond his means. ""In general I try and budget my daily routine and having the physical money there means it is harder to spend than just placing a piece of card on to a machine,"" he said. The town where 8,000 people share a cash machine Other project areas chosen for the trials include the remoteÂ Lulworth Camp, a military barracks in DorsetÂ miles away from the nearest cash machine. Small towns withÂ thousands of residents whichÂ have seen bank branches or cash dispensersÂ disappear are also included, such as Ampthill, along with Rochford, in Essex,Â Denny near Falkirk, and Cambuslang in Lanarkshire. Burslem, in Staffordshire, is also on the list, as is Hay-on-Wye, which has a large number of bookshops and other small businesses but no bank branchÂ to deposit notes and coins. Millisle, in Northern Ireland, has recently been added as the eighth area to take part in the pilots. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents the UK banks, said the sector was committed to access to cash remaining ""free and widely accessible to those who need it"". Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""While contactless undoubtedly marks the safest way to pay in the current climate, we have to ensure that coronavirus doesn't cause us to sleepwalk into a cashless society we're not ready for yet."" The town where 8,000 people share one cash machine No new 2p or Â£2 coins to be made for 10 years Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' A new bank branch opening! What's going on?

Pubs in Wales to close at 22:00 from Thursday,"This video can not be played ""We cannot let the virus take hold of our lives again"" Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to shut at 22:00 every night under new measures to control the rising rate of coronavirus. The rules, to come into force on Thursday, follow a decision by the UK government to do the same in England. In a broadcast address, First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to avoid unnecessary travel. Sales of alcohol from off-licences and supermarkets after 22:00 will also be stopped. Hospitality businesses will be required to provide table service only. In the recorded statement, Mr Drakeford said there was a very real possibility that Wales could see the virus ""regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities"". ""This is a highly infectious virus, we cannot let it take a hold of our lives again. We have come too far to let that happen,"" he said. 'Closing pubs at 10pm halves your takings' His statement came as the Prime Minister called on the public to summon""discipline and the resolve""to follow new rules. Each nation of the UK is tightening restrictions after Mr Johnson, Mr Drakeford and the first ministers of Scotland and Northern Ireland met on Tuesday morning. Pubs in Wales will have to close at 10pm and only offer table service The changes are in addition to the local lockdown restrictions now in force in six areas of Wales, which people cannot travel in or out of without a good excuse such as work or education. Pubs there already have to shut at 23:00, meaning closing times in the six areas will move an hour earlier. Public Health Wales figures reported 281 further cases of coronavirus on Tuesday,the highest number of cases since April. Mr Drakeford said a Â£500 payment would be provided - as planned for England - for those on low incomes to help them if they need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government says it will also strengthen regulations to ensure employers support those who need to quarantine themselves. He reminded viewers that only six people could meet indoors from a single extended household, comprised of up-to four different households. Mr Drakeford asked people to ""think carefully about making journeys."" ""The fewer people we meet and the fewer journeys we make, the safer we all are,"" he said. However, new pan-Wales travel restrictions are not being made in law. These new measures don't change the Wales-wide picture enormously but they do add to the mosaic building up around the country. There are still much tighter restrictions in local lockdown areas so there's increasing complexity in the rules - and a bigger challenge for politicians and public health officials in communicating which rules apply where. And while these rules may be important in tackling the threat of Covid, getting a testing system that can cope with demand and deliver results in a timely and efficient way is also vital. The Conservative health spokesman in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, called again for ""hyperlocal lockdowns based on the best available data"" so ""little of Wales and its economy as possible is closed, even temporarily"". ""Safeguarding lives as well as livelihoods, and sheltering the economy, must remain the priorities,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said areas under increased restrictions should see stricter rules on alcohol, with sales from off-licences stopped at 18:00 and either pubs closed indoors completely or ones that do not serve food shut. ""Crucially, these steps must be backed up by sector-specific financial support to affected businesses,"" he said, adding that people from lockdown areas elsewhere in the UK should be banned from coming to Wales. Mark Reckless, Brexit Party Senedd leader, said he was opposed to the ""further lockdowns"" announced by the Welsh Government. He told BBC Wales: ""We think it would be better to trust people's individual judgments as to their risk and the risk of those they live with and make their own decisions depending on the evolution of the virus"". Earlier in the Commons Boris Johnson, who is responsible for coronavirus rules in England, said restrictionscould last six months. The Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, covering Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, has warned it is a""matter of weeks"",externalbefore a sharp rise in hospital admissions in the area. The tightening of restrictions comes amid a row over whether the announcement should have been made in the Welsh Parliament first. Presiding officer Elin Jones told the Senedd earlier she had been told final decisions ""aren't likely to be made until a little before"" 20:00 BST on Tuesday. After the news of the restrictions broke two hours before the broadcast by Mr Drakeford, Plaid Cymru's Mr Price accused the Welsh Government of treating the Senedd with contempt. Mr Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said it was disrespectful to Ms Jones, a Plaid Cymru Senedd member who oversees the Welsh Parliament. First Minister Mark Drakeford clarified on Wednesday that pubs and restaurants have to stop serving alcohol at 22:00, rather than close completely.

Nike expects permanent shift to online salesThe sportswear giant has seen digital sales soar and says few customers will revert back to stores.Business,"Sportswear firm Nike has seen a huge rise in online sales as it bounces back from a coronavirus slump. The US company saw digital sales rocket 82% during the June to August quarter, offsetting falling revenue in its stores. On Tuesday, Nike posted revenue of $10.6bn (Â£8.3bn) as many of its key markets recovered including China. For its previous quarter revenues were down by more than a third as it tackled store closures and lockdowns globally. Nike chief executive John Donahoe said the shift to online sales could be a permanent trend. ""We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,"" Mr Donahoe said. This video can not be played Mike Martin led the Guildford Heat to becoming one of the most successful teams in the UK Sales are growing in its major markets including China, Japan, South Korea and the UK, while its core North American market is declining. Nike's shares rose more than 10% in late trading in the US, as the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Nike turns to digital sales during China shutdown The $6bn surge sparked by an icon from 1985 A new way of living and dressing - BBC Culture Nike has been using its website and shopping apps to release limited edition footwear. The sportswear giant has been transforming itself to sell directly to customers over the past few years, reducing its store presence and retail partners. While many gyms have been closed during the pandemic, sportswear makers have reported strong demand for more casual attire as more people work and exercise at home. Rival Adidas said last month that it was seeing improving sales trends while yoga pants maker Lululemon posted a 157% jump in its online business. Like many other retailers, Nike is still limiting the number of people who can come into its stores at once to try to help curb the spread of the virus. But when people do visit, they're coming with the intent to buy, Nike said.

PM warns of tougher virus curbs if rules flouted,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has defended the ""balanced, targeted and proportionate"" new coronavirus measures amid criticism from some scientists. In England,,externalpeople are being told to work from home if they can and rules on face coverings have been expanded. The measures have exposed a split among scientists. Prof John Edmunds, who advises the government, said they did not go ""anywhere near far enough"". But other scientists say they hope they are a shift towards a coherent policy. It comes asScotland recorded 486 new cases on Wednesday- the highest daily total since the pandemic began. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""a real cause for concern"", although she added that more people were being tested now than at the peak of the outbreak. What are the new rules? Sunak weighs up new worker pay subsidy scheme McDonald's 'does not need table service' Asda to crack down on shoppers without face masks Tighter restrictions were announced in all four UK nations on Tuesday. In England these include a 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants from Thursday and the number of people allowed at weddings has been halved. The fines for breaking the rules are set to increase to Â£200 on the first offence. Hospitality venues in Scotland will also have to close early, but in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00.ScotlandandNorthern Irelandhave also gone further by limiting households from mixing indoors. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he supports the new measures, but during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions he accused Boris Johnson of ""losing control"" of the virus and of virus testing. Mr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system, saying it was allowing the government to to see ""in granular detail"" where the epidemic was breaking out. Earlier, Mr Raab said there would always be the ""Goldilocks criticism - too much or too little"" of the government's strategy, but that the aim was to avoid the need for more drastic action. He said if people followed all the existing measures, the country would ""get through this"" and ""get to Christmas not in a national lockdown"". He said there was no fixed end time to the measures - which the prime minister has warnedcould last up to six months. This video can not be played Collective health depended on ""individual behaviour"", Mr Johnson said In an interview on Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Edmunds said the comprehensive lockdown in March had brought the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - down from 2.7 to 0.7. A large range of measures was now needed to stop the epidemic growing any further, he said, casting doubt on the changes of R being below one by Christmas. ""I suspect not. There's a chance, of course there's a chance,"" he said. ""To slow the epidemic down will mean putting the brakes on very hard. I suspect we will see very stringent measures coming in through the UK but it will be too late,"" he warned. Prof Peter Openshaw,  who is also a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a ban on households mixing indoors in England ""ought to be instituted sooner rather than later"". Speaking to Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, he said: ""I think [a ban] may well be coming very soon. I would think if we wait two or three weeks, it will be too late."" The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, is reported to believe it is inevitable England will to have to follow Scotland's latest move,according to the Times,external. Another scientist, Prof Carl Heneghan, from Oxford University, said the measures seemed to show the emphasis of public policy was moving towards personal responsibility, similar to the approach taken in Sweden. He told Today. ""We're starting to understand that we're trying to control the spread of infection as opposed to suppress it."" He added it was important to give these new measures time to work, maintain a clear and consistent public message and not to panic. The debate about what is the right thing to do is just going to get more heated in the coming days and weeks. Cases are rising - and most experts agree the steps taken by the government, certainly in England, are only going to having a minimum effect on curbing an increase in infection rates. What no one knows is how quickly cases will go up - and what impact that will have on hospital admissions and deaths. If the government is determined to suppress the virus - to get the R below one as the prime minister said - more draconian measures will surely follow. But if it was definitely going for this approach, it would surely have gone further with the restrictions it announced on Tuesday. Lockdown-style measures have a greater impact when they are taken earlier. That is what has prompted suggestions it may be moving towards adopting the ""Swedish model"" of accepting some spread. This is being done in the knowledge the UK is now in a better position to protect the vulnerable and treat those who get really sick - enabling ministers to balance the risk of the virus versus the risk to the economy, society and wider health and wellbeing. But it means the big decision is yet to come - and crucial to that will be what happens to hospital cases and deaths. The devolved nations have their own powers over coronavirus restrictions. Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney acknowledged the new rules banning people from visiting other people's homes were ""difficult and disruptive"" and said they would be reviewed every three weeks. ""No one wants to have this in place a moment longer. The more public compliance, the more successful we will be,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Analysis: Last throw of dice before the really tough call 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' 'A stitch in time saves nine' - what does it mean? Wales's First Minister, Mark Drakeford, urged people not to let the virus""take a hold of our lives again"", and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said tougher restrictions should act asa ""wake-up call""that ""we are not out of the woods"". Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. And the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37.

Barclays to send staff back to working from homeCity firms SocGen and Lloyd's of London also tell staff to stop coming into the office after new guidance.BusinessComments,"Barclays will tell ""hundreds"" of UK staff who had gone back to the office to return to working from home. The bank told the BBC it was making the move following the latest guidance from the government that people should work at home when they can. About 1,000 Barclays employees worldwide returned to the office over the summer. French bank Societe Generale and insurance giant Lloyd's of London also told UK staff to work from home again. Barclays said it would not be releasing a country-specific number on those returning to work from home. The bank had said it would carry out a ""gradual"" return to the office in October, after chief executive Jess Staley signalled thathe wanted employees working from home during the pandemic to return to the office""over time"". ""It is important to get people back together in physical concentrations,"" he told Bloomberg TV in July. New Covid restrictions could last six months - PM However, not all banks take the same view. NatWest has said staff can continue to work from home until next year. On Tuesday, Societe Generale said it was also ""adapting its position in line with UK government guidance"", without stating the number of workers in its London offices would now work from home. Lloyd's of London said it had told its 800 directly employed staff to work from home but that this did not apply to the independent brokers who use its Lime Street headquarters. ""Lloyd's underwriting room is certified as a Covid-secure environment and will remain open for market participants,"" the company said. Business groups have reacted with dismay to the prime minister's call for people to work at home where they can. The CBI said that it was a ""crushing"" blow that would have a ""devastating impact"". It marks a change in policy followinga government advertising campaign to get people back to workwhere safe. Campaign group London First said it would discourage people from returning to workplaces and risk ""derailing an already fragile recovery"". CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""We know we need to avoid a second national lockdown at all if we possibly can, but I have to say these are crushing blows. ""The impact on people who are coming back into their offices, the impact on city centres, so dependent on the bustle of city life, our creative industries - this will have a devastating impact on people and businesses. ""And I think that the answer for business, and what I'm hearing in my conversations this morning, is make it a short, sharp shock if it has to happen."" Public transport is still a worry for many people Appearing on the Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 live, she said she was speaking to the programme from her office and that ""about 15%"" of her people were in. ""They're excited about coming back, we need to plan to bring more people back. It's good for morale, it's good for learning, it's good for creativity and so many businesses are feeling that, so this is a backward move that won't be welcomed, and let's make it as short as it needs to be."" ""The new restrictions must be regularly reviewed to minimise the damage to the economy while safeguarding the health of the nation in the round - not just physical health, but mental health and our economic health, said London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread. She also called for the government to extend business rates relief and to introduce a ""targeted"" version of the furlough scheme, which is due to end on 31 October. As well as the change in stance on working from home, Boris Johnson also confirmed that pubs and restaurants in England will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday to stop the spread of the coronavirus. He warned that the new measures could last up to six months. Ms Whitbread said: ""A targeted version of the furlough scheme would help those hardest hit in leisure, retail and hospitality."" Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said the spread of coronavirus was not wholly predictable, but the ""back and forth"" on office working would cause ""frustration"". He added: ""Business leaders are eager for the government to focus on the foundations, issues like childcare, public transport, and getting the testing system firing on all cylinders.""

Could the furlough scheme be extended?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. There is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: There are a number offree online benefits calculators,externalfrom organisations includingentitledto,external,Turn2Us,external, andPolicy in Practice,external TheMoney Navigator tool,externalfrom the Money and Pensions Service relates to coronavirus-related money matters Further guidance is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland from theLow Incomes Tax Reform Group,external The government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme. From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?
