Fare rise suspended in Chile as unrest continuesSecurity forces and demonstrators clash in Santiago as protests over economic issues spread.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Unrest sparked by a metro fare hike continues in Santiago Three people have been killed by a fire inside a supermarket in Santiago during a second night of protests in Chile. Two people died at the scene and another died in hospital after the store was looted, Santiago's regional governor, Karla Rubilar, said. President PiÃ±era has suspended the rise in metro fares that sparked the protests, but unrest has continued. Soldiers and tanks were deployed after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a night curfew. The protests have broadened to reflect general discontent about the high cost of living in one of Latin America's most stable countries. The unrest, the worst in decades, has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In parts of Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In the second day of violent demonstrations, protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire, and police used tear gas and water cannon. Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic. More than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said. Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago Speaking on television, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"" and to discontent over the cost of living. Gen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas. The military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Later on Saturday, the mayors of the ValparaÃ­so region and ConcepciÃ³n province also announced states of emergency. Earlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised. Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment Protests were also reported in the cities of ConcepciÃ³n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, ValparaÃ­so, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper. Meanwhile, a picture of President PiÃ±era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media. Critics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans. Allow Twitter content?

Libor rigging inquiry shut downThe Serious Fraud Office unexpectedly closes an investigation into interest rate fraud.Business,"An investigation into the rigging of Libor, the benchmark interest rate that tracks the cost of borrowing cash, has been unexpectedly closed. The decision comes despite evidence that implicates the Bank of England. It means no one will now be prosecuted in the UK for so-called ""low-balling"", where banks understate interest rates they pay to borrow cash. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said its decision followed a detailed review of the evidence. Thirteen traders and money brokers were prosecuted over four years by the SFO in connection with rigging Libor. Bank implicated in Libor rigging Can we ever trust bankers again? What is the Libor scandal and why does it matter? Six have been prosecuted by the US Department of Justice (DoJ). A further 11 traders have been prosecuted for manipulating Euribor, the eurozone equivalent of Libor. The SFO said aspects of its Euribor investigation remain open. In a statement, the SFO said: ""Following a thorough investigation and a detailed review of the available evidence, there will be no further charges brought in this case. This decision was taken in line with the test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors."" The code states that the evidence must support a realistic prospect of conviction and must be in the public interest. This video can not be played The BBC's Andrew Verity explains the Libor scandal What the FTSE 100 index is to share prices, Libor is to interest rates: an index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash. Millions of residential mortgages and commercial loans around the world have interest rates linked to Libor. Each day banks estimate what interest rate they think they'll have to pay to borrow money and an average is published as the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). The SFO and DoJ prosecuted the traders over requests for Libor estimates to be nudged up or down by one or two hundredths of a percentage point to suit banks' trading positions, which were linked to the Libor average. However more traders have been acquitted than found guilty. In the United States, two traders, Matt Connolly and Gavin Black, await sentencing later this month. Connollyhas gone public to protest his conviction. His lawyers told the court it was accepted commercial practice for traders to make requests for high or low Libor estimates to suit the bank's commercial interests, within a range of accurate estimates of the cost of borrowing cash. Requests for much greater shifts in Libor estimates - up to 50 times the size of the shifts that traders sought - were made by banks' senior managers during the credit crunch of 2007-2009, a practice known as ""low-balling"" for which banks have been fined. Senior executives were concerned that if banks acknowledged the high interest rates they were paying to obtain scarce funds, it could cause bad publicity and knock their banks' share prices. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009 the Bank of England, concerned about financial stability, intervened in the Libor setting process. Evidence of low-balling obtained by the BBC includes a secret audio recording from 2008 implicating the Bank of England and sworn testimony given to the US Department of Justice that Barclays was told by the Bank of England to lower its Libor estimates as early as 1 September 2007. However, senior Barclays bankers and Bank of England executives told Parliament in 2012 that they had not known about low-balling until that year, 2012. When thesecret audio was broadcast in April 2017, MPs called for an immediate inquiry. The Bank of England has said Libor was unregulated at the time. Defence lawyers at the Libor trials have questioned why the SFO has charged or prosecuted no one in connection with low-balling. The SFO told the court it had an investigation running into low-balling. As recently as May 2019, the SFO re-iterated that stance, telling journalists it was still investigating the practice. The SFO said its general counsel, Sara Lawson QC, made the decision to close the Libor investigation because its director, Lisa Osovsky, was recused from the Libor case. Ms Osovsky has a background of roles in enforcement, including as deputy general counsel to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has investigated Libor rigging.

PM to send unsigned letter seeking Brexit delay,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I will not negotiate a delay with the EU"" Boris Johnson has sent a request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - but without his signature. The request was accompanied by a second letter, signed by Mr Johnson, saying he believes a delay would be a mistake. The PM was required by law to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline after losing a Commons vote. EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he had received the extension request and would consult EU leaders ""on how to react"". Earlier, Mr Johnson rang European leaders, including Mr Tusk, to insist that the letter ""is Parliament's letter, not my letter"". LIVE: Reaction after PM sends Brexit extension letters Jubilant scenes on 'final say' Brexit protest Saturday's Brexit vote: What happens now? Analysis: Another 'meaningful vote'? Opposition MPs have warned the PM that if he tries to circumvent Parliament's instructions to seek a delay, then he may find himself in the law courts. Mr Johnson has vowed to press ahead with the legislation to implement his deal next week, but Labour says it will seek to amend it - to add additional measures on issues like workers' rights and environmental protections. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News Sophie Ridge the prime minister could ""well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts"" by sending a second letter to the EU that ""contradicted"" the first. The PM has previously said he would""rather be dead in a ditch""than ask the EU to delay Brexit, and the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". But hours after losing a crunch vote in a historic Saturday session in the House of Commons, the prime minister ordered a senior diplomat tosend an unsigned photocopy of the requestfor a delay, which was forced on him by MPs last month. The second letter from Mr Johnson - signed off this time - makes clear he personally believes a delay would be damaging. It says the government will press on with efforts to pass the revised Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders last week into law, and that he is confident of doing so by 31 October. A cover note from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's representative in Brussels, explained the first letter complied with the law as agreed by Parliament. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg describedthe decision to send three documents as ""controversial"", predicting ""there will be a fight about whether Boris Johnson is trying to circumvent the court"". ""This is heading straight for the court, and it may very quickly end up in the Supreme Court,"" she added. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether the PM's move was ""childish, Conservative Brexiteer MP Nigel Evans said: ""Well he was going to be criticised if he didn't send the letter, because it would have been against the law."" He added that ""it's not all in our gift"", and that EU leaders may look at both letters and deny the request for a delay. Extracts from Mr Johnson's letter to Mr Tusk: ""The UK Permanent Representative will... submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today. It is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider this request and whether to grant it. ""Although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October. ""While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister... that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us. ""We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent."" Read the letters in full. At the first Saturday sitting in the Commons for 37 years, MPs voted in favour of an amendment withholding approval of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal until all the necessary legislation had been passed. Tabled by Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, the amendment was intended to ensure that Mr Johnson would comply with the terms of the so-called Benn Act. Under that act, Mr Johnson had until 23:00 BST on Saturday to send a letter requesting a delay to the UK's departure. In a letter to MPs and peers on Saturday evening, he said: ""I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as prime minister: further delay is not a solution. ""It is quite possible that our friends in the European Union will reject Parliament's request for a further delay (or not take a decision quickly)."" The Commons defeat marked a major setback for the PM - although Mr Johnson said he was not ""daunted or dismayed"" and remained committed to taking Britain out by the end of the month with his ""excellent deal"". John McDonnell said MPs should now have the chance to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement legislation. He said Mr Johnson had removed certain protections contained in Theresa May's deal with the EU and Labour wanted to see those reinstated. ""Do we want to go down the Boris Johnson proposals of diverging from our major trading partner and deregulating our economy, undermining workers' rights, consumer and environment rights? No we don't,"" he said. ""So what we'll try and do is, of course, try and amend that legislation and see if we can get agreement in Parliament."" Mr McDonnell said Mr Johnson was ""behaving a bit like a spoilt brat"" by sending an unsigned letter to Brussels. Anna Soubry, from The Independent Group for Change, accused the prime minister of acting like a ""truculent child"", while Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine MP said Mr Johnson was going against the will of the Commons. SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said earlier that if Mr Johnson acted as if he was ""above the law"", he would find himself in court. On the EU side, there has been no official response yet to the contents of the letter, except Mr Tusk confirming he received it. But the French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already signalled that he believed a new Brexit extension was not good for anyone. Boris Johnson literally spelling out his opposition to prolonging the Brexit process by writing a separate letter to Brussels to say so, makes it easier for his peers Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and others to drag their feet a little. They prefer first to look to the prime minister to make good on his promise to them that their newly-negotiated Brexit deal will *definitely* be passed by Parliament. But, if push comes to shove, with the alternative being no deal at all... I cannot imagine the EU slamming the door in the face of the UK now. They will want to know what [the extension] is for. Are there plans in the UK to hold a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on the new Brexit deal? Or is a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation? Read Katya's full analysis The EU Parliament's Brexit Steering Group will discuss the outcome of the latest UK vote on Monday, said Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt. He tweeted on Saturday: ""Whatever happens next, the marches outside the Parliament show just how important a close EU - UK future relationship is."" Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, said the government planed to hold a meaningful vote on Monday - although it is not clear whether Commons Speaker John Bercow will allow it.

Dozens protest against China during US NBA game,"Protesters held signs and wore masks during the pre-season basketball game in New York Dozens of spectators at a US basketball game have held signs and donned T-shirts and masks in support of protests in Hong Kong. Demonstrators gathered during a match in New York between the Brooklyn Nets and the Toronto Raptors. The move was organised by film producer Andrew Duncan, who bought 300 tickets for the activists. It comes amid an ongoing row between China and the NBA over the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since March. Images from the pre-season game on Friday show demonstrators wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ""Stand With Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"". Two other people were also pictured wearing Winnie-the-Pooh costumes. The cartoon bear is used as a symbol to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping and is banned in China. Footage from the protest was shared on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the group was Hong Kong activist Nathan Law, the former chairman of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party he co-founded with fellow campaigner Joshua Wong. ""We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong,externaland the NBA,"" another spectator, Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post. ""[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America."" Local media report that some of demonstrators were ejected from the game for chanting. Similar demonstrations have already been held at other games between American and Chinese teams. Earlier this month, during a match between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, two people were asked to leave for holding signs in support of Hong Kong protests. NBA facing 'substantial' losses over China dispute How one tweet derailed the NBA's China game plan At another game between the Loong-Lions and the Washington Wizards, local media report that spectators had their pro-Hong Kong signs confiscated. But Friday's protest was the first to be held during a match between two NBA teams. The spat between the league and China's government began earlier this month after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protests in Hong Kong. As a result, several Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals with the NBA - a huge financial blow to the league, which has millions of followers in China. In Hong Kong this week, some protesters burned jerseys of basketball star LeBron James in response to his comments about the demonstrations The Rockets and the NBA quickly distanced themselves from Mr Morey's tweet, while basketball superstar LeBron Jamessuggested the Rockets' manager ""wasn't educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai - who is also the vice-chairman of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba - has also criticised Mr Morey for his ""damaging"" tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong. ""Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,"" Mr Tsai added. Mr Morey has since backtracked on his tweet. but US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have accused the NBA of bowing to Beijing.

What will happen with Brexit in the next few days?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period.

The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Dozens protest against China during US NBA gameSpectators at a US basketball match don t-shirts and masks in support of the Hong Kong protests.US & Canada,"Protesters held signs and wore masks during the pre-season basketball game in New York Dozens of spectators at a US basketball game have held signs and donned T-shirts and masks in support of protests in Hong Kong. Demonstrators gathered during a match in New York between the Brooklyn Nets and the Toronto Raptors. The move was organised by film producer Andrew Duncan, who bought 300 tickets for the activists. It comes amid an ongoing row between China and the NBA over the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since March. Images from the pre-season game on Friday show demonstrators wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ""Stand With Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"". Two other people were also pictured wearing Winnie-the-Pooh costumes. The cartoon bear is used as a symbol to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping and is banned in China. Footage from the protest was shared on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the group was Hong Kong activist Nathan Law, the former chairman of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party he co-founded with fellow campaigner Joshua Wong. ""We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong,externaland the NBA,"" another spectator, Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post. ""[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America."" Local media report that some of demonstrators were ejected from the game for chanting. Similar demonstrations have already been held at other games between American and Chinese teams. Earlier this month, during a match between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, two people were asked to leave for holding signs in support of Hong Kong protests. NBA facing 'substantial' losses over China dispute How one tweet derailed the NBA's China game plan At another game between the Loong-Lions and the Washington Wizards, local media report that spectators had their pro-Hong Kong signs confiscated. But Friday's protest was the first to be held during a match between two NBA teams. The spat between the league and China's government began earlier this month after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protests in Hong Kong. As a result, several Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals with the NBA - a huge financial blow to the league, which has millions of followers in China. In Hong Kong this week, some protesters burned jerseys of basketball star LeBron James in response to his comments about the demonstrations The Rockets and the NBA quickly distanced themselves from Mr Morey's tweet, while basketball superstar LeBron Jamessuggested the Rockets' manager ""wasn't educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai - who is also the vice-chairman of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba - has also criticised Mr Morey for his ""damaging"" tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong. ""Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,"" Mr Tsai added. Mr Morey has since backtracked on his tweet. but US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have accused the NBA of bowing to Beijing.

Solar Orbiter ready to take on audacious mission,"The spacecraft has finished its test campaign and is now ready to go to Cape Canaveral in Florida The European spacecraft that aims to take the closest ever pictures of the Sun is built and ready for launch. TheSolar Orbiter, or SolO,external, probe will put itself inside the orbit of Planet Mercury to train its telescopes on the surface of our star. Other instruments will sense the constant outflow of particles and their embedded magnetic fields. Scientists hope the detailed observations can help them understand better what drives the Sun's activity. This goes up and down on an 11-year cycle. It's sure to be a fascinating endeavour but it's one that has direct relevance to everyone on Earth. The energetic outbursts from our star have the ability to damage satellites, harm astronauts, degrade radio communications, and even knock power grids offline. ""We're doing this not just for the sake of increasing our knowledge but also for being able to take precautions, for example by putting satellites in safe mode when we know big solar storms are coming or letting astronauts not leave the space station on these days,"" said Daniel MÃ¼ller, the European Space Agency (Esa) project scientist on SolO. Europe eyes improved 'space weather' resilience Parker Solar Probe smashes speed record This video can not be played Holly Gilbert: ""Knowledge even more important when we send astronauts to the Moon and Mars"" The probe was assembled in Stevenage, UK, by Airbus (Britain has invested â¬220m in the â¬1.5bn project), with the past year spent here at the IABG facility in Ottobrunn, Germany, for testing. The spacecraft has cleared its checks and will now ship out to Florida to be mated with the United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket that will hurl it towards the Sun in early February. SolO was first conceived in the late 1990s withthe industrial contract to produce it awarded in 2012. A key challenge has been to mature technologies that can protect a probe that flies to within 43 million km of our star. Temperatures at this proximity will get up to 600 degrees. SolO's plan to survive these conditions involves hiding behind a large titanium shield, and cooling itself with a complex series of radiators. Sophisticated fault-recovery systems will also ensure SolO stays out of trouble. ""If we de-point, we very quickly run into difficulty thermally,"" explained Airbus project manager Ian Walters. ""Our requirement is to make sure we recover under any failure scenario within 50 seconds and actually our spacecraft will go back to normal pointing in 22 seconds, all autonomously."" The heatshield has peepholes to allow the telescopes to see the Sun But the probe still needs to observe the star and to do that it must use peepholes in the shield. These will briefly open to allow the telescopes to grab their observations before closing shut again. The pictures and movies that come back will be unprecedented in their fine resolution. Features as small as 70km across will be visible. ""It's amazing; every time we get better resolution we see more and more,"" said Holly Gilbert, the US space agency's deputy project scientist on the mission. ""The interactions between the Sun's plasma (energetic gas) and its magnetic field are incredibly dynamic, not just on the large scales but on the very, very small scales. ""When the magnetic fields interact in a very explosive process called reconnection - that's a very small region. ""And to see how that leads to eruptions, we need to see the small stuff that's happening."" One of the major differences between this mission and all previous such ventures is that SolO will get to take the first close-up images of our star's polar regions. The high latitudes are known to be significant locations for magnetic behaviour and the generation of the fastest outflows of particles. ""We've never seen the solar poles directly because from Earth we just have a very grazing view,"" said FrÃ©dÃ©ric AuchÃ¨re, a mission principal investigator from the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Orsay, France. ""But these regions are very important because they are the source of the very fast solar wind and we also know that in the solar interior things are happening at the poles that may be the key to understanding solar activity and the solar cycle."" SolO will be followingthe American Parker Solar Probe, which launched to space last year. The pair share many of the same scientific goals and even the same kinds of instruments, although only SolO will look directly at the Sun. Parker can't do that because it's venturing even closer to the star, a mere 6 million km at closest approach. It uses just in-situ sensors, to sample for example the particles flowing over it. But scientists believe the duo when in the right position will make a powerful team in observing processes that initiate close in to the Sun but then propagate outwards. ""There are so many ways we can combine these spacecraft to get incredible science. The first serious opportunity will come in September next year,"" Tim Horbury, from Imperial College London, told BBC News.

All Blacks rout Ireland to set up England semi-final,"The All Blacks took a stranglehold on the game with two tries by scrum-half Aaron Smith Rugby World Cup quarter-final: Ireland v New Zealand New Zealand:(22) 46 Tries:A Smith 2, B Barrett, Taylor, Todd, Bridge, J BarrettCons:Mo'unga 4Pen:Mo'unga Ireland:(0) 14 Try:Henshaw, penalty tryCon:Carbery New Zealand will meet England in the World Cup semi-finals after condemning Ireland to a seventh quarter-final exit with a 46-14 hammering in Tokyo. Two tries from Aaron Smith and one by Beauden Barrett helped the All Blacks to a 22-0 lead at half-time. The holders scored further tries through Codie Taylor, Matt Todd, George Bridge and Jordie Barrett. Robbie Henshaw's score and a penalty try did nothing to recover what was a disastrous display for Ireland. Billed as the defining final chapter in Joe Schmidt's tenure as head coach, Ireland's World Cup in Japan will go down as another failure with no indication that the team are any closer to the world's elite than they were when they exited at the same stage four years ago. Ireland fell to their heaviest defeat in a World Cup match This was Ireland's second defeat in the tournament - their 19-12 Pool A loss to hosts Japan having deprived them of a last-eight meeting with South Africa and a possibly easier route to a first semi-final. Meanwhile, the All Blacks will move into the semi-finals as even stronger favourites to lift a third successive Webb Ellis Cup than they were at the start of the tournament having produced a display that few, if any, sides would be capable of delivering. The narrative from the Ireland camp remained consistent throughout the week-long build-up: they had to produce an almost flawless display if they were to even run New Zealand close. However, not for a single minute of Saturday's contest did it look as though Ireland possessed the tools capable of derailing the champions. Ireland skipper Rory Best made an emotional exit in his last match Indeed, it was New Zealand who produced what was infinitely closer to perfect rugby, taking their game to a level with which Ireland could not contend. After Richie Mo'unga had kicked his side ahead, Smith navigated the All Blacks deep into Ireland territory before darting through a gap to score. Although still in the first quarter, the signs were looking ominous for Ireland, with New Zealand winning the battle at the breakdown and punching holes in the defence as they stretched their play left, right and back again through the scintillating back three of Barrett, Sevu Reece and Bridge. Ireland needed a spark and had the opportunity to push New Zealand onto their try-line with a kick to the corner, but Johnny Sexton missed his touch and two minutes later the ball was back at the opposite end of the pitch, with Smith diving over again from close range. The third try, which killed off any faint Irish hopes of a revival, came from an Ireland move inside the New Zealand half, with Reece's hit on Sexton dislodging the ball, allowing Barrett to kick through and gather beyond the line. Jordie Barrett bagged the final try for the All Blacks who now play England in Yokohama on 26 October After spending much of 2019 clinging onto the form of last year as an indicator of their potential, Ireland's defeat by New Zealand in Tokyo presents a far clearer picture of their place on the world stage than their win over the All Blacks 10 months ago did. The manner of the loss leaves little room for an argument that Ireland can be considered among the top sides in the world. By the time Taylor dived over on 48 minutes after his side had worked the ball through the phases, it was clear that New Zealand were operating on a level that Ireland were not capable of reaching. For all of Ireland's shortcomings, the All Blacks were relentlessly wonderful. Their fifth try arrived after the forwards set-up field position for Mo'unga to kick crossfield for Reece to gather and present for Todd to score. Ireland did score eventually, as Henshaw cut back against the grain to put his side on the board 10 minutes from time. Bridge and Jordie Barrett, having been introduced from the bench, benefited from more superb New Zealand ball movement to add further scores either sides of Ireland's penalty try. Beauden Barrett made 21 carries in the game, the most by a New Zealand player in a World Cup match New Zealand have won 29 of their 32 meetings with Ireland in Test rugby (D1, L2), including both of their matches at the World Cup (43-19 in 1995). Ireland have lost all seven of their World Cup quarter-finals, never making it past this round, No side has endured as many losses at this stage. Two of Ireland's three biggest defeats under Joe Schmidt have now come in World Cup quarter-finals (also 43-20 v Argentina in 2015), while the other came less than two months ago against England (57-15). New Zealand scored seven or more tries in a World Cup knockout match for the third time in their history (eight v Wales in 1987, nine v France in 2015). No other side has scored more than six tries in a match beyond the pool stage of the tournament. Matt Todd became the fifth player to score a try and be yellow-carded in a World Cup knockout game - the previous four were all from New Zealand or France (S Betsen, L Picamoles, L McAlister, J Kaino). New Zealand:B Barrett; Reece, Goodhue, Lienert-Brown, Bridge; Mo'unga, Smith; Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Retallick, Whitelock; Savea, Cane, Reid. Replacements:Coles, Tuungafasi, Ta'avao, S Barrett, Todd, Perenara, Williams, J Barrett.

Carney: Deal 'positive' for UK economy,"This video can not be played 'Deal takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit' The governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC that the new Brexit deal struck by the government is ""welcome"" and a ""net economic positive"". Mark Carney said the deal ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"". However the governor warned that the deal might not boost the economy to the same extent as the deal put forward by Boris Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. Mr Johnson's dealis due to be voted onby MPs on Saturday. Mr Carney said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated this week meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the economy as the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. When pressed about the impact of extra customs checks likely from the more distant relationship with the EU envisaged by the new deal, Mr Carney said its economic outcome would not ""overlap"" the closest version of the previous Theresa May deal, ""and that last bit is diplomacy"". ""The new economic partnership remains to be negotiated so there's still a wide range of potential relationships that can be struck on the basis of this deal, but short term, it takes away these risks,"" said Mr Carney. ""Last night in the G20 room it was universally welcomed that this progress had been made because, if I put this into context - the world's global economic outlook - the world is in a precarious position - I'm quoting the IMF - and directionally we'd agree with that characterisation. Brexit deal would make Wales poorer - Drakeford New Brexit deal: Your questions answered Pound's gains erased amid Brexit deal jitters Chancellor Sajid Javid has been less diplomatic, refusing to recalculate Treasury impact assessments, despite requests from some MPs who want an economic forecast in time for the crucial Commons vote on the deal. His decision not to release a new analysis has drawn criticism from those who think MPs should have an updated version of the impact the deal. Catherine McKinnell MP, interim chair of the Treasury Committee, has written to the chancellor asking him to publish an updated economic analysis ahead of the vote on Saturday. ""The Treasury Committee asked HM Treasury whether the government has updated its economic analysis of Brexit three months ago, yet we are still awaiting a response,"" she wrote. ""It appears to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny. If the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands.""

What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights?What will happen with Brexit in the next few days?How might MPs vote on the Brexit deal?,"Labour has warned that Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal would threaten workers' rights and protections in the future. The concerns have been echoed by several union leaders. But Boris Johnson has insisted the UK will ""maintain the highest possible standards in social protections and the environment"". So, why the sudden focus on workers' rights? It's all to do with something called the ""level playing field"" - the idea that countries keep their rules and standards close, to stop one country giving their businesses a competitive advantage - for example by having lower standards and so lower costs. The extent to which the UK might diverge from EU regulations in the future and become an economic competitor has been a big issue in the Brexit debate. EU regulations cover things like: The working time directive, which limits the number of hours people can work Maximum amounts of particular pollutants there can be in the air Requirements for workers doing the same jobs to be paid equally. They set minimum standards below which government cannot go. After Brexit, UK governments would no longer have to abide by these minimum levels. In thenew Brexit deal,externalfinalised this week, references to a level playing field were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement. Instead, they appear in the non-binding political declaration on the future relationship - as an aspiration, but not a legal commitment. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of pursuing ""a licence to deregulate"" the economy in the future. He warned that - after Brexit - the UK might choose to follow other ""economic models"" (than the EU's) and cited the example of the United States where, he said, the holiday entitlement was 10 days a year and companies ""had far more power than the workforce"". In response to concerns, the government said that after Brexit it would report back to parliament whenever the EU changes its rules on workers' rights, on whether the UK plans to take action to mirror them. MPs would be given a chance to vote on this. Boris Johnson has made it known that he wants a slightly more distant economic relationship with the EU in the future than Theresa May did. She talked about the ""broadest and deepest possible"" economic partnership. He wants a more basic free trade agreement, with zero tariffs (taxes on imports) or quotas, which gives the UK more opportunity to go its own way. Too many level playing field commitments could get in the way of that. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Where have the UK and EU compromised? The revised political declaration says that the UK and the EU should ""uphold the common high standards... in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters"". But if words of that kind do not appear in a binding treaty, then this or any future government could opt to change its mind. The EU is well aware of that - and some countries are more concerned about the nature of the future relationship in this area than in the precise details of the divorce agreement. ""With the departure of Great Britain, a potential competitor will of course emerge for us,"" Angela Merkel said on a visit to Paris in the run-up to this summit. ""That is to say, in addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well."" The UK is a far smaller economy than the US or China. But it is right on the EU's doorstep, intimately connected to European markets, and thus is seen as a potential threat. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

What will happen with Brexit in the next few days?How might MPs vote on the Brexit deal?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed.

"Nurses 'most likely cause' of Strep A outbreakThe bacterium has infected at least 33 people in Essex, claiming 15 lives.Essex","The outbreak of Group A streptococcal infection began in Braintree The ""most likely cause"" of a bacterial outbreak that has seen 15 people die was district nursing teams, a document obtained by the BBC has revealed. At least 33 people in Essex have been infected by the strain ofinvasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) bacterium. Of 32 cases initially found in the area 29 had previously been visited by Provide nurses, files obtained showed. Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said an investigation into the cause was continuing.

Rory Best's farewell to Irish rugby did not turn out the way he'd have liked, but Ireland came up against a New Zealand side in ruthless form in Tokyo.

But fear not, you don't have to wait until next weekend for more action - we'll be back bright and early tomorrow to bring you full coverage of Wales v France and Japan v South Africa.

FT: Ireland 14-46 New Zealand More from Joe Schmidt, who is leaving Ireland after this tournament:""Irish rugby is in a really good place. This year hasn't been great but I felt if we had another couple of days to prepare we might have been a little bit better.

FT: Ireland 14-46 New Zealand Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, speaking to ITV:""We gave them too many access points into the game, turned the ball over, missed opportunities to get into their zone and put pressure on.

Since joining the Ireland coaching team we have lost all the fizz in the backs steadily over time.

Farrell was dumped by England and should be dumped by Ireland before he can do more harm. Anon (remember to put your names on texts please) FT: Ireland 14-46 New Zealand That's seven World Cup quarter-final outings for Ireland, and seven defeats.

Denis HickieFormer Ireland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Joe Schmidt has been a trans-formative character in Irish rugby, starting off at Leinster. He took this Irish side to a level never previously seen. There have been so many firsts. But unfortunately the measure of his career was always likely to be this World Cup, after the last one. His ambition would have been to go further than they ever have before. The defeat to Japan now looks worse because it meant they had to play New Zealand today. Â© 2025 BBC.

Solar Orbiter ready to take on audacious missionA UK-assembled European spacecraft aims to take the closest ever pictures and movies of the Sun.,"The spacecraft has finished its test campaign and is now ready to go to Cape Canaveral in Florida The European spacecraft that aims to take the closest ever pictures of the Sun is built and ready for launch. TheSolar Orbiter, or SolO,external, probe will put itself inside the orbit of Planet Mercury to train its telescopes on the surface of our star. Other instruments will sense the constant outflow of particles and their embedded magnetic fields. Scientists hope the detailed observations can help them understand better what drives the Sun's activity. This goes up and down on an 11-year cycle. It's sure to be a fascinating endeavour but it's one that has direct relevance to everyone on Earth. The energetic outbursts from our star have the ability to damage satellites, harm astronauts, degrade radio communications, and even knock power grids offline. ""We're doing this not just for the sake of increasing our knowledge but also for being able to take precautions, for example by putting satellites in safe mode when we know big solar storms are coming or letting astronauts not leave the space station on these days,"" said Daniel MÃ¼ller, the European Space Agency (Esa) project scientist on SolO. Europe eyes improved 'space weather' resilience Parker Solar Probe smashes speed record This video can not be played Holly Gilbert: ""Knowledge even more important when we send astronauts to the Moon and Mars"" The probe was assembled in Stevenage, UK, by Airbus (Britain has invested â¬220m in the â¬1.5bn project), with the past year spent here at the IABG facility in Ottobrunn, Germany, for testing. The spacecraft has cleared its checks and will now ship out to Florida to be mated with the United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket that will hurl it towards the Sun in early February. SolO was first conceived in the late 1990s withthe industrial contract to produce it awarded in 2012. A key challenge has been to mature technologies that can protect a probe that flies to within 43 million km of our star. Temperatures at this proximity will get up to 600 degrees. SolO's plan to survive these conditions involves hiding behind a large titanium shield, and cooling itself with a complex series of radiators. Sophisticated fault-recovery systems will also ensure SolO stays out of trouble. ""If we de-point, we very quickly run into difficulty thermally,"" explained Airbus project manager Ian Walters. ""Our requirement is to make sure we recover under any failure scenario within 50 seconds and actually our spacecraft will go back to normal pointing in 22 seconds, all autonomously."" The heatshield has peepholes to allow the telescopes to see the Sun But the probe still needs to observe the star and to do that it must use peepholes in the shield. These will briefly open to allow the telescopes to grab their observations before closing shut again. The pictures and movies that come back will be unprecedented in their fine resolution. Features as small as 70km across will be visible. ""It's amazing; every time we get better resolution we see more and more,"" said Holly Gilbert, the US space agency's deputy project scientist on the mission. ""The interactions between the Sun's plasma (energetic gas) and its magnetic field are incredibly dynamic, not just on the large scales but on the very, very small scales. ""When the magnetic fields interact in a very explosive process called reconnection - that's a very small region. ""And to see how that leads to eruptions, we need to see the small stuff that's happening."" One of the major differences between this mission and all previous such ventures is that SolO will get to take the first close-up images of our star's polar regions. The high latitudes are known to be significant locations for magnetic behaviour and the generation of the fastest outflows of particles. ""We've never seen the solar poles directly because from Earth we just have a very grazing view,"" said FrÃ©dÃ©ric AuchÃ¨re, a mission principal investigator from the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Orsay, France. ""But these regions are very important because they are the source of the very fast solar wind and we also know that in the solar interior things are happening at the poles that may be the key to understanding solar activity and the solar cycle."" SolO will be followingthe American Parker Solar Probe, which launched to space last year. The pair share many of the same scientific goals and even the same kinds of instruments, although only SolO will look directly at the Sun. Parker can't do that because it's venturing even closer to the star, a mere 6 million km at closest approach. It uses just in-situ sensors, to sample for example the particles flowing over it. But scientists believe the duo when in the right position will make a powerful team in observing processes that initiate close in to the Sun but then propagate outwards. ""There are so many ways we can combine these spacecraft to get incredible science. The first serious opportunity will come in September next year,"" Tim Horbury, from Imperial College London, told BBC News.

Ali Lothian, 60, and Mettje Hunneman, 49, travelled from Dundee and Edinburgh respectively overnight to join the protest. Ali told the BBC she felt it was the last chance to show how strongly she felt about having another vote. Mettje Hunneman, left, and Ali Lothian travelled from Dundee and Edinburgh for the march She said: ""It's a big commitment - it's a whole weekend. But I regretted not coming last time.

Millie, from Plymouth, has never been on a march before She added: ""I just think Brexit has gone completely the wrong way. I want to be optimistic but I'm preparing myself for the worst."" One group of protesters were seen pulling a float depicting top aide Dominic Cummings using Mr Johnson as a puppet. With ""Demonic Cummings"" splashed across its forehead, the figure on the float appears to be wearing a Nazi uniform, including an armband which reads Get Brexit Done, and has a Union Jack moustache. Who is Dominic Cummings? By Katie Wright, BBC News It was deja vu for many people as they descended on the streets of central London once again to demand a final say on Brexit. Six months on from the last big rally, there was bright sunshine and blue skies to greet the protesters - which included many returning faces, as well as those marching for the first time. In March a carnival vibe accompanied the slow walk from Park Lane to Parliament Square, but university student Ben Stocks said the atmosphere this time was ""more sombre"". Another member of the crowd, Simon Gosden, 63, agreed, saying: ""There's more of an air of tension. We know we're getting down to the nitty gritty - it's all or nothing."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson were among the politicians to address the rally at Parliament Square, alongside celebrities including Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart and TV presenter Sandi Toksvig. Sir Patrick told the crowd they had proven another referendum was not a ""pipe dream"". He said: ""You haven't just filled a nice bar in north London, you have taken over an entire city. You haven't just impacted the Brexit debate, you have transformed British politics."" Well-known faces also joined in the walk to Parliament Square, including TV chef Rick Stein, who shared a picture from the march. Allow Twitter content?

The deal: Your questions answered,"A Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU, but what does it all mean? We answer a sample of the questions we have received from readers. Under law, yes he does. The Benn Act, passed by MPs last month,says that Mr Johnson would be required to request a three-month Brexit delay - unless he can pass a deal, or get MPs to approve a no-deal exit by 19 October. That's Saturday. Parliamentwill be sitting that day, which is when MPs are likely to hold a vote on Mr Johnson's new deal. The UK will still pay a ""divorce bill"" under Mr Johnson's deal. However, because the UK has had an extended stay in the EU,the actual bill would now be about Â£33bn,external. The new proposals are much the same as Theresa May's deal. The main difference is on the crucial issue of the Irish border and whether the UK will leave the customs union entirely after the transition period. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The UK does not plan to introduce visas for tourists from the EU. So, for short-term trips, things should be more or less the same. Since the UK voted to leave the EU, the value of the pound has fallen. This is despitea small rise after the deal was announced. This is because of all the uncertainty around what Brexit might look like. It's hard to predict how the value of the pound will change. One common suggestion to get the most out of your holiday money is to change half a few weeks before, and the other half a couple of days before, to hedge your bets. The Labour leader said the deal is worse than Mrs May's because the proposals ""risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections"". He said the deal would be ""putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers' rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations"". Mr Corbyn said the deal should be rejected. No, not as the law currently stands. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 says that in order to make a withdrawal agreement valid, it has to be approved by Parliament. You are hearing about Northern Ireland because the removal of the old backstop is probably the biggest single change. Other parts of the withdrawal agreement, such as the transition period, citizens' rights, and the money the UK has to pay, will stay the same. The UK will still follow EU rules and regulations until the end of 2020. But under the new deal the whole of the UK will definitely leave the EU customs union at that point. The UK will also leave the single market, but Northern Ireland will continue to follow all its regulations for agrifood and industrial goods. There have also been changes to the political declaration which sets out plans for the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. It says the future relationship will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, but there's no guarantee one can be agreed by the end of 2020. Mr Johnson's deal mainly focuses on solving the problem of the Irish border. When it comes to citizens' rights, he has kept the agreements made by Mrs May. UK nationals living legally in an EU country at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 will be able to stay and enjoy the same rights. Anyone arriving after that will be subject to each country's immigration rules. Up until the end of transition, UK nationals will still be able to move freely to the EU. No, there would not be a hard border as long as the provisions of the deal stay in place. Under the deal there would be no customs checks or regulatory checks on goods going between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The solution - in this deal - is to effectively have the customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK (you will hear people talk about ""a border in the Irish Sea""). The EU has said - in practice - this will mean all checks on goods will be done by UK officials ""at points of entry"" in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly would get a chance to vote on these arrangements four years after the end of the transition period (which finishes at the end of 2020 but could be extended by a year or two years). And even if they were voted down - which is considered unlikely - there would then be a two-year cooling off period for other arrangements to be made to try to avoid a hard border. Yes, the UK would leave the EU's customs union, through which matters of trade are negotiated for all of its members as a bloc. That means the whole of the UK will be able to strike its own trade deals with non-EU countries as well as with the EU - although this could take some time. What is in the new Brexit deal? What are the backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? The deal states that at the end of the transition period is in December 2020, while the rest of the UK will leave all of the EU's institutions, Northern Ireland will have to keep to some of the EU's rules. In some cases it will have to charge EU taxes on certain types of goods. This situation will continue until a new agreement on the future relationship is reached, or Northern Ireland votes down the deal. Its government will have the opportunity to vote on the provisions of this deal after four years, and then at least every eight years after that.

Europeâs leaders tune in for Parliament Brexit drama,"Angela Merkel said the EU did not negotiate the Brexit deal to have it rejected The mood among Europe's leaders was triumphant. They had a deal and as they left Brussels, everyone was happy. But will the EU's relief be short-lived? Across the capitals of Europe all eyes will now turn to Westminster, for a rare Saturday session of Parliament to decide the fate of the revised Brexit deal. ""It is now a matter of putting faith in the British parliament to take its decision,"" said Germany's Angela Merkel. They have been here before. Theresa May's deal was rejected three times by MPs. Yet more than 90% of the new deal isâ¦ Theresa May's deal. The challenge of having a porous EU external border in Northern Ireland was the stumbling block that needed solving. Finally the Eurosceptic Boris Johnson, famous for poking fun at EU bureaucracy, won generous praise from EU leaders at the Brussels summit. Allow Twitter content?

One of his fiercest EU critics on Brexit, French President Emmanuel Macron, spoke of Mr Johnson's ""strategic thinking, his willingness to engage and a wish to persevere"". He added that ""he's colourful sometimes"". Summit chairman Donald Tusk warmly patted Mr Johnson on the shoulder and Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel beamed at him - having only recently mocked him for dodging a press conference. Five reasons EU is happy with revised Brexit deal How would another Brexit delay work? Europe's press welcomes Brexit deal but doubts success After more than three years of tortuous negotiations the EU believes it now has an innovative solution for the Northern Ireland border. This video can not be played ""The Queen will still be the Queen"" - Leo Varadkar In one-on-one talks with Irish Taoiseach (PM) Leo Varadkar, before the summit, Boris Johnson accepted that Northern Ireland could keep EU regulatory standards and have a unique customs inspection system. It means in effect a customs border in the Irish Sea, with new checks on goods at Northern Ireland's ports and Belfast airport. Goods destined for the Republic of Ireland - the EU - will come under the EU tariff regime. The special arrangement was dictated by both sides' commitment to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. That peace accord demands that there be no ""hard"" land border on the island of Ireland. But the Brexit deal would take the UK out of the EU single market and customs union - commonly described as a ""hard"" Brexit. So much for the legal technicalities. The big question now is whether Mr Johnson can get the deal through the House of Commons. How might MPs vote on the Brexit deal? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Saturday's Brexit debate: What to expect A day of high drama is expected, as the vote will be on a knife edge. The government's recent suspension of Parliament - ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court - angered many MPs. There was discomfort among EU leaders when asked what they would do if Westminster rejected this deal. Would they grant another, third, extension to the Brexit negotiations? Mr Varadkar was asked if there was an EU Plan B. His reply: ""Plan B is no deal. Let's hope that doesn't happen."" There was no guarantee of another extension, he said. This video can not be played Crunching the numbers as MPs prepare for key Brexit vote The pressure to meet the 31 October deadline is there in the summit conclusions, calling for the EU to prepare for the deal to ""enter into force on 1 November"". The deal allows a transition period until the end of 2020. In contrast, a no-deal scenario would make the UK a ""third country"" overnight, subject to EU tariffs and other barriers immediately. The EU's Donald Tusk did not rule out another extension. But President Macron said: ""I don't think that a new delay should be agreed on. I think we need to end the negotiations and move on to talks about future relations."" A year is not much time for the EU to negotiate a free trade deal with the UK. And the risk of a no-deal Brexit has not gone away. Belgium alone could lose 42,000 jobs in the worst-case scenario, according to a Leuven Catholic University study. The port of Zeebrugge does about half of its trade with the UK. Amid European sadness and frustration over Brexit, there is also some optimism. Mr Varadkar said the EU had shown ""enormous solidarity"" with Ireland, and he called it a union ""in which small states are protected"". And Ulrich Ladurner, Brussels correspondent for Germany's Die Zeit daily, told the BBC: ""Many Europeans feel Brexit has shown the strength of the EU"". This video can not be played Will MPs support Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal?

Since joining the Ireland coaching team we have lost all the fizz in the backs steadily over time. Not to take away from an amazing performance from the All Blacks but Ireland are better than this and other performances in the World Cup. Farrell was dumped by England and should be dumped by Ireland before he can do more harm. Anon (remember to put your names on texts please) FT: Ireland 14-46 New Zealand That's seven World Cup quarter-final outings for Ireland, and seven defeats. Would they have reached the semis if they'd topped the pool and faced South Africa in the last-eight instead? Who knows, but this one will hurt. Denis HickieFormer Ireland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Joe Schmidt has been a trans-formative character in Irish rugby, starting off at Leinster. He took this Irish side to a level never previously seen. There have been so many firsts. But unfortunately the measure of his career was always likely to be this World Cup, after the last one. His ambition would have been to go further than they ever have before. The defeat to Japan now looks worse because it meant they had to play New Zealand today. Â© 2025 BBC.

What does the deal say about workers' rights?,"Labour has warned that Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal would threaten workers' rights and protections in the future. The concerns have been echoed by several union leaders. But Boris Johnson has insisted the UK will ""maintain the highest possible standards in social protections and the environment"". So, why the sudden focus on workers' rights? It's all to do with something called the ""level playing field"" - the idea that countries keep their rules and standards close, to stop one country giving their businesses a competitive advantage - for example by having lower standards and so lower costs. The extent to which the UK might diverge from EU regulations in the future and become an economic competitor has been a big issue in the Brexit debate. EU regulations cover things like: The working time directive, which limits the number of hours people can work Maximum amounts of particular pollutants there can be in the air Requirements for workers doing the same jobs to be paid equally. They set minimum standards below which government cannot go. After Brexit, UK governments would no longer have to abide by these minimum levels. In thenew Brexit deal,externalfinalised this week, references to a level playing field were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement. Instead, they appear in the non-binding political declaration on the future relationship - as an aspiration, but not a legal commitment. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of pursuing ""a licence to deregulate"" the economy in the future. He warned that - after Brexit - the UK might choose to follow other ""economic models"" (than the EU's) and cited the example of the United States where, he said, the holiday entitlement was 10 days a year and companies ""had far more power than the workforce"". In response to concerns, the government said that after Brexit it would report back to parliament whenever the EU changes its rules on workers' rights, on whether the UK plans to take action to mirror them. MPs would be given a chance to vote on this. Boris Johnson has made it known that he wants a slightly more distant economic relationship with the EU in the future than Theresa May did. She talked about the ""broadest and deepest possible"" economic partnership. He wants a more basic free trade agreement, with zero tariffs (taxes on imports) or quotas, which gives the UK more opportunity to go its own way. Too many level playing field commitments could get in the way of that. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Where have the UK and EU compromised? The revised political declaration says that the UK and the EU should ""uphold the common high standards... in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters"". But if words of that kind do not appear in a binding treaty, then this or any future government could opt to change its mind. The EU is well aware of that - and some countries are more concerned about the nature of the future relationship in this area than in the precise details of the divorce agreement. ""With the departure of Great Britain, a potential competitor will of course emerge for us,"" Angela Merkel said on a visit to Paris in the run-up to this summit. ""That is to say, in addition to China and the United States of America, there will be Great Britain as well."" The UK is a far smaller economy than the US or China. But it is right on the EU's doorstep, intimately connected to European markets, and thus is seen as a potential threat. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy,"This video can not be played 'Deal takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit' The governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC that the new Brexit deal struck by the government is ""welcome"" and a ""net economic positive"". Mark Carney said the deal ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"". However the governor warned that the deal might not boost the economy to the same extent as the deal put forward by Boris Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. Mr Johnson's dealis due to be voted onby MPs on Saturday. Mr Carney said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated this week meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the economy as the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. When pressed about the impact of extra customs checks likely from the more distant relationship with the EU envisaged by the new deal, Mr Carney said its economic outcome would not ""overlap"" the closest version of the previous Theresa May deal, ""and that last bit is diplomacy"". ""The new economic partnership remains to be negotiated so there's still a wide range of potential relationships that can be struck on the basis of this deal, but short term, it takes away these risks,"" said Mr Carney. ""Last night in the G20 room it was universally welcomed that this progress had been made because, if I put this into context - the world's global economic outlook - the world is in a precarious position - I'm quoting the IMF - and directionally we'd agree with that characterisation. Brexit deal would make Wales poorer - Drakeford New Brexit deal: Your questions answered Pound's gains erased amid Brexit deal jitters Chancellor Sajid Javid has been less diplomatic, refusing to recalculate Treasury impact assessments, despite requests from some MPs who want an economic forecast in time for the crucial Commons vote on the deal. His decision not to release a new analysis has drawn criticism from those who think MPs should have an updated version of the impact the deal. Catherine McKinnell MP, interim chair of the Treasury Committee, has written to the chancellor asking him to publish an updated economic analysis ahead of the vote on Saturday. ""The Treasury Committee asked HM Treasury whether the government has updated its economic analysis of Brexit three months ago, yet we are still awaiting a response,"" she wrote. ""It appears to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny. If the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands."" Previous Treasury forecasts showed a smaller economy from a basic free trade agreement. Johnson in race to win support for Brexit deal What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal?

Ireland set for All Blacks quarter-final,"The All Blacks took a stranglehold on the game with two tries by scrum-half Aaron Smith Rugby World Cup quarter-final: Ireland v New Zealand New Zealand:(22) 46 Tries:A Smith 2, B Barrett, Taylor, Todd, Bridge, J BarrettCons:Mo'unga 4Pen:Mo'unga Ireland:(0) 14 Try:Henshaw, penalty tryCon:Carbery New Zealand will meet England in the World Cup semi-finals after condemning Ireland to a seventh quarter-final exit with a 46-14 hammering in Tokyo. Two tries from Aaron Smith and one by Beauden Barrett helped the All Blacks to a 22-0 lead at half-time. The holders scored further tries through Codie Taylor, Matt Todd, George Bridge and Jordie Barrett. Robbie Henshaw's score and a penalty try did nothing to recover what was a disastrous display for Ireland. Billed as the defining final chapter in Joe Schmidt's tenure as head coach, Ireland's World Cup in Japan will go down as another failure with no indication that the team are any closer to the world's elite than they were when they exited at the same stage four years ago. Ireland fell to their heaviest defeat in a World Cup match This was Ireland's second defeat in the tournament - their 19-12 Pool A loss to hosts Japan having deprived them of a last-eight meeting with South Africa and a possibly easier route to a first semi-final. Meanwhile, the All Blacks will move into the semi-finals as even stronger favourites to lift a third successive Webb Ellis Cup than they were at the start of the tournament having produced a display that few, if any, sides would be capable of delivering. The narrative from the Ireland camp remained consistent throughout the week-long build-up: they had to produce an almost flawless display if they were to even run New Zealand close. However, not for a single minute of Saturday's contest did it look as though Ireland possessed the tools capable of derailing the champions. Ireland skipper Rory Best made an emotional exit in his last match Indeed, it was New Zealand who produced what was infinitely closer to perfect rugby, taking their game to a level with which Ireland could not contend. After Richie Mo'unga had kicked his side ahead, Smith navigated the All Blacks deep into Ireland territory before darting through a gap to score. Although still in the first quarter, the signs were looking ominous for Ireland, with New Zealand winning the battle at the breakdown and punching holes in the defence as they stretched their play left, right and back again through the scintillating back three of Barrett, Sevu Reece and Bridge. Ireland needed a spark and had the opportunity to push New Zealand onto their try-line with a kick to the corner, but Johnny Sexton missed his touch and two minutes later the ball was back at the opposite end of the pitch, with Smith diving over again from close range. The third try, which killed off any faint Irish hopes of a revival, came from an Ireland move inside the New Zealand half, with Reece's hit on Sexton dislodging the ball, allowing Barrett to kick through and gather beyond the line. Jordie Barrett bagged the final try for the All Blacks who now play England in Yokohama on 26 October After spending much of 2019 clinging onto the form of last year as an indicator of their potential, Ireland's defeat by New Zealand in Tokyo presents a far clearer picture of their place on the world stage than their win over the All Blacks 10 months ago did. The manner of the loss leaves little room for an argument that Ireland can be considered among the top sides in the world. By the time Taylor dived over on 48 minutes after his side had worked the ball through the phases, it was clear that New Zealand were operating on a level that Ireland were not capable of reaching. For all of Ireland's shortcomings, the All Blacks were relentlessly wonderful. Their fifth try arrived after the forwards set-up field position for Mo'unga to kick crossfield for Reece to gather and present for Todd to score. Ireland did score eventually, as Henshaw cut back against the grain to put his side on the board 10 minutes from time. Bridge and Jordie Barrett, having been introduced from the bench, benefited from more superb New Zealand ball movement to add further scores either sides of Ireland's penalty try. Beauden Barrett made 21 carries in the game, the most by a New Zealand player in a World Cup match New Zealand have won 29 of their 32 meetings with Ireland in Test rugby (D1, L2), including both of their matches at the World Cup (43-19 in 1995). Ireland have lost all seven of their World Cup quarter-finals, never making it past this round, No side has endured as many losses at this stage. Two of Ireland's three biggest defeats under Joe Schmidt have now come in World Cup quarter-finals (also 43-20 v Argentina in 2015), while the other came less than two months ago against England (57-15). New Zealand scored seven or more tries in a World Cup knockout match for the third time in their history (eight v Wales in 1987, nine v France in 2015). No other side has scored more than six tries in a match beyond the pool stage of the tournament. Matt Todd became the fifth player to score a try and be yellow-carded in a World Cup knockout game - the previous four were all from New Zealand or France (S Betsen, L Picamoles, L McAlister, J Kaino). New Zealand:B Barrett; Reece, Goodhue, Lienert-Brown, Bridge; Mo'unga, Smith; Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Retallick, Whitelock; Savea, Cane, Reid. Replacements:Coles, Tuungafasi, Ta'avao, S Barrett, Todd, Perenara, Williams, J Barrett. Ireland:Kearney; Earls, Ringrose, Henshaw, Stockdale; Sexton, Murray; Healy, Best, Furlong, Henderson, James Ryan, O'Mahony; Van der Flier, Stander.

What is in the PM's new Brexit deal?,"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

Thief stole from man suffering cardiac arrest,"Police said Danilo Furtado had shown ""a complete disrespect for others"" A thief who stole a phone, wallet and jewellery from a man who was suffering a cardiac arrest has been jailed. Danilo Furtado, 34, admitted stealing from the 73-year-old, who fell ill on the steps near the Metrolink platform at Bury Interchange at about 23:10 BST on 15 August. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said Furtado, of no fixed address, had shown ""a complete disrespect for others"". He was jailed for 20 months at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. A GMP spokesman said instead of calling for help, Furtado ""chose to steal a number of his personal belongings including his phone, wallet and a gold chain"". He said the emergency services were contacted about five minutes later and the man was taken to hospital, but died the next day. Speaking after sentencing, Det Con Dave Potter said Furtado had ""preyed on a vulnerable man"", adding: ""I honestly cannot comprehend that someone would stoop to such levels."" ""Furtado's actions have shown that he has a complete disrespect for others and I hope this sentencing sends a clear message that this shocking behaviour will not be tolerated.""
