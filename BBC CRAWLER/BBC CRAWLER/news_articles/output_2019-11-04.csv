UK terrorism threat at lowest level for five years,"""Substantial"" is the third out of five possible ratings for the country's level of terror threat The UK's terrorism threat level has been downgraded from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", the Home Office says. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at ""a high level of threat"" and an attack could ""occur without further warning"". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains ""severe"". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a ""direct and immediate"" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government. There was a surge in terror attacks in 2017, including in London Bridge where eight people were killed UK terror threat: How has it changed? Right-wing extremism to inform terror threat level Reality Check: How terrorism threat levels work ""Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms,"" Ms Patel said. The threat level is kept under ""constant review"", she added. Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been ""positive developments"" in the fight against terrorism but it was ""vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance"". He saidthe UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations,external- while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of ""subjects of interest"" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are ""lone actors"" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. TheUK's terrorism threat level,externalwas raised to the highest rating, ""critical"", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, ""severe"", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC,externalare: Low - an attack is highly unlikely Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely Substantial - an attack is likely Severe - an attack is highly likely Critical - an attack is highly likely in the near future Right-wing extremism to inform terror threat level UK terror threat: How has it changed?

Voyagers shed light on Solar System's structure,"Artwork: The Voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977 Data sent back by the two Voyager spacecraft have shed new light on the structure of the Solar System. Forty-two years after they were launched, the spacecraft are still going strong and exploring the outer reaches of our cosmic neighbourhood. By analysing data sent back by the probes, scientists have worked out the shape of the vast magnetic bubble that surrounds the Sun. The two spacecraft are now more than 10 billion miles from Earth. Researchers detail their findings in six separate studies published in the journal Nature Astronomy. ""We had no good quantitative idea how big this bubble is that the Sun creates around itself with its solar wind - ionised plasma that's speeding away from the Sun radially in all directions,"" said Ed Stone, the longstanding project scientist for the missions. ""We certainly didn't know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge and leave the bubble to enter interstellar space."" The plasma consists of charged particles and gas that permeate space on both sides of the magnetic bubble, known as the heliosphere. Voyager probe 'leaves Solar System' Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Measurements show that the identical probes have exited the heliosphere and entered interstellar space - the region between stars. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, Voyager 2 crossed over late last year. The key sign in both cases was a jump in the density of plasma. This showed that the spacecraft were passing from an environment with hot, lower density plasma characteristic of the solar wind and entering a region with the cool, higher density plasma thought to be found in interstellar space. The boundary between the two regions is known as the heliopause. Artwork showing the heliosphere, along with the interstellar medium ""We saw the plasma density at the heliopause jump by a very large amount - a factor of 20, at this rather sharp boundary out there,"" said Prof Don Gurnett, from the University of Iowa. ""Actually, with Voyager One we saw an even bigger jump."" The findings suggest that the heliosphere is symmetrical, at least at the two points that the Voyager spacecraft crossed. The researchers say these points are almost at the same distance from the Sun, indicating a spherical front to the bubble - ""like a blunt bullet"", according to Prof Gurnett. The results also provide clues to the the thickness of the ""heliosheath"", the outer region of the magnetic bubble. This is the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind of particles in interstellar space, which Prof Gurnett likens to the effect of a snow plow on a city street. The heliosheath appears to vary in its thickness. This is based on data showing that Voyager 1 had to travel further than its twin to reach the heliopause, where the solar wind and the interstellar wind are in balance. Some had thought Voyager 2 would make that crossing into interstellar space first, based on models of the magnetic bubble. ""In a historical sense, the old idea that the solar wind will just be gradually whittled away as you go further into interstellar space is simply not true,"" says Don Gurnett. ""We show with Voyager 2 - and previously with Voyager 1 - that there's a distinct boundary out there. It's just astonishing how fluids, including plasmas, form boundaries.""

Cuadrilla hopes to overturn fracking suspension,"Fracking at Cuadrilla Resources site in Lancashire in August caused a 2.9 magnitude earth tremor Energy company Cuadrilla has said it hopes to ""address concerns"" about fracking so that a moratorium announced by the government can be overturned. At the weekend, ministers called a halt to the practice following research from the Oil and Gas Authority. It raised concerns about the ability to predict fracking-linked earthquakes. But Cuadrilla, which was forced to suspend work at its Preston New Road site after a series of tremors, said it would continue to give regulators data. It said it hoped ""to address concerns so that the moratorium can be lifted"" and that the Bowland gas resource - which stretches across northern England - could be ""further appraised and developed"". Fracking halted after government pulls support On Monday, Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom confirmed the ""effective moratorium"" in a written statement to the House of Commons. She said it would be ""maintained until compelling new evidence is provided which addresses the concerns around the prediction and management of induced seismicity"". However, the government is under pressure to make the ban permanent, amid concerns ministers - who have previously been supportive of fracking - are using it as an election ploy. Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it. Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland resource across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand. Local communities and environmental groups have protested against fracking Others, however, have questioned these findings. Previously the government said shale development would provide opportunities for jobs and investment, and could play a ""key role"" in maintaining energy security. But the industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups, at a time when there is growing concern about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It is not impossible, however, that the current moratorium could be lifted. Fracking previously faced a moratorium during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government that was overturned after just one year.

Labour candidate sorry for 'celebrate deaths' post,"Zarah Sultana: ""I should not have articulated my anger in the manner I did, for which I apologise"" A Labour general election candidate has apologised for saying she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of world leaders, including Tony Blair. Zarah Sultana wrote on social media in 2015: ""Try and stop me when the likes of Blair, Netanyahu and Bush die."" In her apology on Monday, Ms Sultana said she had been ""exasperated by endless cycles of global suffering, violence and needless killing"". She is contesting the Coventry South seat on 12 December. In 2015, Ms Sultana also wrote of hersupport for ""violent resistance"" by Palestinians,external, the Jewish Chronicle reported. She told the BBC the tweets were from a ""deleted account dating back several years from when I was a student"". ""This was written out of frustration rather than any malice,"" she said in a statement, explaining that her anger had arisen ""from decisions by political leaders, from the Iraq War to the killing of over 2,000 Palestinians in 2014, mostly civilians, which was condemned by the United Nations"". She added: ""I do not support violence and I should not have articulated my anger in the manner I did, for which I apologise."" When she was announced as the Coventry South candidate last week, she wrote on social media: ""With your support, I will be a strong socialist voice for working people in this city.""

Missing red panda recaptured after drone search,"Red pandas are classified as endangered A red panda that escaped from a wildlife park on the Isle of Man has been recaptured after being spotted up a tree in a garden. ""Kush"" went missing from Curraghs Wildlife Parkthree weeks ago, after a tree fell across his enclosure. The panda is now being checked over in the park's hospital unit before being returned to its home. General manager Kathleen Graham said staff were ""really relieved"" the search had ended positively. A live trap had been set and a drone was also used to locate the animal, which was eventually spotted in the garden of a home about a mile away in Tholt-y-Will, Sulby. The seven-year-old mammal ""might have lost a bit of weight"" but otherwise ""looks quite healthy,"" Mrs Graham said. It took staff ""about an hour"" to capture the animal with a net before he was taken back to the park in a box. Since the escape, tree branches that looked in danger of breaking in the red panda enclosure had been removed, Mrs Graham said.

Krept: 'Knife wound was 1mm away from being fatal',"This video can not be played Krept: I'm staying positive after knife attack Rap star Krept says he nearly lost his life after being attacked backstage at a BBC Radio 1Xtra gig in Birmingham. The star, whose real name is Casyo Johnson, was left with slash wounds in the leg and neck after the incident. ""I got a report back saying if [the blade] was a millimetre deeper, it could have been fatal,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I'm just grateful to even be here. It could have been a lot worse,"" he added. ""Thank God."" The star is one half of the grime duo Krept & Konan. They had been due to perform at 1Xtra Live at the Birmingham Arena on 5 October; but the concert was called off after the violence. This video can not be played Backstage footage at 1Xtra Live The stars subsequently postponed their tour to allow Krept to recover, but the 29-year-old said he wouldn't let the injury affect their career. ""I'm fine, I'm good,"" he said. ""I'm still going to get on with it... We're still going to do positive things and let people know that, no matter what happens, you can get through it."" The duo appeared on the Victoria Derbyshire programme to discuss their new album, Revenge Is Sweet. It's a record that showcases their breadth and versatility, from the bristling confidence of the opening track, Goat Level, to the cathartic closer,Broski,external- a tribute to their friend and business partner, Nash Chagonda, who tragically took his own life last year. The duo said the song was written to ""change the perspective"" on mental health. ""I feel like a lot of people suffer from it, but they keep it to themselves,"" said Konan, whose real name is Karl Wilson. ""A lot of people aren't confident to reach out and talk about what they're going through. So if you're listening to our music and you hear us talking about it, maybe it'll make you think, 'The people I look up to are talking about it, so I don't [need to] feel scared'."" ""We have to spread this message and let people know it's OK to talk,"" added Krept. ""Let people know. There's someone in your life that's definitely willing to help. Nobody wants anybody to commit suicide."" Krept and Konan say Drill can provide young people with a route out of violence The band were dealt a second blow earlier this year, when Krept's cousin Blaine Johnson was killed in a car accident while travelling to a gig in Staffordshire. Blaine, who was 28, performed under the name Cadet, and had just scored his first Top 20 single before he died. ""We was inseparable, we grew up together, we had the same dream of making music,"" said Konan. ""It was very hard to get through it."" ""We have a group chat and we used to banter every day. And now they [Nash and Blaine] are not here, but you go in the group chat and their names are still in the group chat and it feels so weird."" He said losing two of his closest friends had overshadowed the making of his own record, but the band resolved to be positive. ""We said, 'We are going to keep his name alive and we're gonna do this for him and continue his dream. And that is what motivated us to get through to finishing the album."" The band hit the headlines earlier this year withthe release of a short film, Ban Drill, that argued against a police initiative that requires social media companies to delete drill videos that are found to encourage violence. ""If it is inciting or glamorising violence, then we think they have a social responsibility to work with us to take those videos down,"" Met Commissioner Cressida Dick explained. Krept and Konan said that logic was ""just lazy,"" and failed to tackle ""the actual root"" of violence in deprived areas of London. In response, the duo have set up the Positive Direction Foundation, which provides after-school activities in an effort for teenagers. ""We've gone to the heart of where everything's happening,"" said Konan. ""We've gone to the kids, and tried to help them, give them something to do after school and distract them from that kind of life."" ""When we was getting in trouble when we was younger, what would have happened if they'd banned our music?"" added Krept. ""We wouldn't be here, setting up foundations, changing our lives, changing our perspectives. ""You've got to take people out of these situations to change their situation. ""We want to get to the actual root of what the issue is, rather than just saying just 'ban the music'."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Tories stand by candidate over Facebook post,"Francesca O'Brien admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"" A Conservative general election candidate has apologised for a Facebook post in which she said people on a TV show needed ""putting down"". Francesca O'Brien, who is running for the Gower seat in December's election, made the comments about Channel 4's Benefits Street in January 2014. Ms O'Brien said her comments were made ""off the cuff"" but admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"". Labour and the Lib Dems called for the candidate to be dropped. But Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies has stood by Ms O'Brien, who is still set to run in the general election on 12 December. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine voters in Gower backing such a candidate, while a Tory peer has said the candidate should consider her position. The former commissioned officer with the RAF Air Cadets was selected to be the Conservative party candidate for Gower in October after an open primary in which residents were able to participate as opposed to just party members. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election Having lost Gower to Labour in the 2017 election, the seat is a top Tory target in Wales. In the posts following the broadcast of the first episode of Benefits Street five years ago, Ms O'Brien said: ""Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!"" Responding to another user's comment, she said: ""My blood is boiling, these people need putting down."" The Conservatives won Gower - which Labour held for more than 100 years - in 2015, but lost it in the 2017 snap election In a statement released on Sunday, Ms O'Brien said: ""These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. ""However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the Today programme what Ms O'Brien said was ""clearly wrong"", adding it was important she had apologised. Asked if Ms O'Brien should stand, she said: ""I think that would be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next Member of Parliament."" But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine ""decent people"" in the constituency backing a candidate with ""views of that sort"". ""I think she is condemned out of her own mouth more eloquently than anything I could say,"" Mr Drakeford told his monthly press conference. Ian Lavery, Labour Party chairman, said: ""Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer.Â ""The cuts to benefits and Universal Credit programme that Therese Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty."" He said Ms O'Brien's candidacy was ""shameful"". Speaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said he thought Ms O'Brien's comments were ""awful"". ""I'm sure she does too,"" he added. ""I do think she should consider her position."" Byron Davies said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process The chairman of the Welsh Conservatives said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process. Lord Davies - a former MP for the constituency - said: ""The comments were inadvisable, obviously, but made in the heat of the moment watching a television programme. ""But I don't condone it in any shape or form. However, this is a dredging exercise on the part of the Labour Party whose candidate in the Gower doesn't want to talk about Brexit."" Benefits Street, which featured the residents of James Turner Street in Birmingham, was a ratings hit for Channel 4 when it was broadcast. But a total of 887 viewers complained to the broadcasting regulator, claiming the show had vilified and misrepresented benefits claimants. Ofcom decided the programmedid not breach broadcastingrules. Ms O'Brien is due to stand against Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi, Plaid Cymru's John Davies and Sam Bennett of the Liberal Democrats. Other parties are yet to confirm their candidates.

OneCoin lawyer on trial for role in 'crypto-scam',"OneCoin's promoters claimed it would deliver a ""financial revolution"" The trial of a US lawyer accused of laundering some of the proceeds from the OneCoin cryptocurrency ""scam"" has begun in New York. Mark Scott is accused of routing approximately $400m (Â£310m) out of the US while trying to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds. Some is alleged to have ended up in Bank of Ireland accounts. Prosecutors claim he also spent some of the fraud's proceeds on a yacht, three homes and a Ferrari car. They add that while the accused had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in his role as a partner at a top-ranked law firm, this was ""a fraction of the money he was paid to launder OneCoin fraud scheme proceeds"". A recent filing by his lawyers indicate thatthey expect the government will prove that money that originated,externalwith OneCoin was indeed invested in funds controlled by the defendant. A BBC podcast about OneCoin's missing co-founder Dr Ruja Ignatova has drawn attention to the scheme But they point to the fact that Mr Scott previously,externaltold the FBI that that he had asked a colleague to look into rumours that OneCoin might be a ""pyramid scheme"" before getting involved, and had been reassured ""there was nothing illegal going on"". ""The central issue at trial will be whether or not Mr Scott knew OneCoin was operating a criminal scheme,"" they add. Mr Scott faces one charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering and another to commit bank fraud. He has pleaded not guilty. The judge in the case has said it is likely to last between two to three weeks. US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case. In total, investigators believe as much as Â£4bn sterling has been raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK, among other countries. ""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys say in one filing. ""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand."" Among the evidence the prosecutors intend to present is testimony from one investor who they say wired thousands of dollars for a OneCoin package to a German entity, which in turn sent millions of euros directly to the defendant's investment funds. Others involved in OneCoin are also facing prosecution. The man alleged to be one of the scheme's leaders, Konstantin Ignatov, was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March. And one of its co-founders, Sebastian Greenwood, was extradited from Thailand to the US following an operation involving the FBI in November 2018. However, the Bulgarian-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing. ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,"" it said in a recent statement given to The Missing Cryptoqueen, a BBC podcast. It added: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully proceedings against OneCoin. We are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established."" Journalist Jamie Batlett has been investigating OneCoin for a BBC podcast series The BBC podcast has been documenting the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova, another of the co-founders and the original public face of OneCoin. The ex-McKinsey consultant had appeared at numerous events and on social media to promote the scheme. But she disappeared from view around October 2017 and there has not been a confirmed sighting since.

US notifies UN of Paris climate accord withdrawal,"This video can not be played Watch Trump explain why he is pulling the US out of Paris climate accord The US has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, notifying the UN of its intention to leave, as other countries express regret and disappointment at the move. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The US government says the deal puts an ""unfair economic burden"" on Americans. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015, committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C,externalabove pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision to withdraw - taken by President Donald Trump after he came to office in 2017 - made the US the world's sole non-signatory and prompted high-level efforts by the European Union to keep the agreement on track. However, hundreds of local governments, businesses and organisations in the US have joined the We Are Still In movement, pledging to cut emissions and move to renewable energy. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so,external. Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the agreement one of his election campaign pledges but UN rules had meant it was not possible for the US to start the withdrawal process until 4 November 2019. The withdrawal is still subject to the outcome of next year's US presidential election - if Mr Trump loses, the winner may decide to change course. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But scientists and environmentalists fear the effect the Trump administration will have on climate protections in the meantime. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris pullout: The worst is yet to come Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal A report issued in December 2018 by the Institute of International and European Affairs suggestedPresident Trump's decision to leave had done ""very real damage"",externalto the Paris agreement, creating ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"". The decision by the US - one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - drew condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. An official for France's presidential office said ""we regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary."" French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet in Beijing on Wednesday, where they are expected to sign a statement declaring the ""irreversibility of the Paris accord"", the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the US could take more responsibility in what was a multilateral process instead of adding ""negative energy"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, a European Commission spokeswoman responded by saying the agreement was ""here to stay"". ""Its door remains open and we hope the US will join it again one day,"" she said. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for talks Climate change: Are lifestyle changes the only answer? Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House,condemned Mr Trump's move as a ""disastrous decision that sells out our children's future"",external, while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would ""sacrifice the planet for their greed"". ""It is about the darkest moment in American diplomacy in a very, very long time and a huge blow to global efforts,"" Bill McKibben, leader of climate campaign group 350.org, told the BBC's Newsday programme. However, the move was welcomed by Republican congressman Gary Palmer, who tweeted: ""It is high time for the US to leave this overly regulative and burdensome agreement that doesn't really address climate change."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the agreement had imposed an ""unfair economic burden"" on the United States. Instead, he said, the US would follow ""a realistic and pragmatic model"", using ""all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump promised to turn the US into an energy superpower, and has attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He has characterised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Announcing his decision to withdraw in June 2017, Mr Trump said: ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests."" He said the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost economic output and 6.5 million jobs but a US government report last year said that, on the contrary,unchecked climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect  on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

Clutha crash pilot's reputation 'sullied' by inquiry,"Capt David Traill's partner said the inquiry's determination did no justice to his reputation or the memories of nine others killed The fiancee of the helicopter pilot who died in the Clutha crash has described the fatal accident inquiry's findings as ""distressing and incomprehensible"". Dr Lucy Thomas said she felt compelled to respond after Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull ""opted to sully the distinguished reputation"" of the pilot. The inquiry, which closed on Thursday, found Captain David Traill ""took a chance"" and ignored low fuel warnings. The police helicopter crashed into the Glasgow bar's roof on 29 November 2013. The tragedy claimed the lives of the pilot, his two crew members and seven customers in the pub. Mr Turnbull said the tragedy happened because 51-year-old Captain David Traill had ignored the five warnings he received during the flight. He said that was a ""conscious decision"" which had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. Crew members PC Tony Collins, 43 and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, were killed, as were customers Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. Another 31 people were injured. Dr Thomas, who was engaged to Captain Traill, broke almost six years of media silence on the incident with a public statement. She said: ""Such is my strength of feeling since the sheriff principal's determination on the fatal accident inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash, I feel compelled to make this statement. ""I am overwhelmed by the support that I have received from so many people, many of whom don't know me and didn't know Dave. I am eternally grateful for this. ""It is my understanding that due to misleading information from the aircraft fuel gauge and display system, Dave had only moments to make decisions and carry out tasks in an attempt to respond to this issue."" The manufacturer's maintenance manual incorrectly said there was three to four-minute flameout time before the helicopter would lose both engines, but in reality he only had 32 seconds, Dr Thomas said. ""That 32 seconds ended in tragedy and the loss of his and nine other valuable lives. This has devastated the lives of all who surround them and impacted on so many more."" Dr Thomas said the determination did ""no justice to the memories"" of the nine other people killed in the crash or to the ""memory and reputation of Dave Traill"". ""It insults the intelligence of those who know of the evidence presented at the inquiry and are aware of the content of the initial AAIB report,"" she added. The expression of disbelief from many family members of those who died at the conclusion drawn in the inquiry ""speaks volumes and means much more to me than the opinion of the sheriff principal"", she said. ""I find it distressing and incomprehensible that given months, not moments, to consider the facts, the sheriff principal has come to this conclusion."" Dr Thomas pointed out the EC135 model of helicopter's ""history of faults with the caution advisory display"" amongst other technical problems such as contamination of the fuel tanks, which she said were never fully resolved by the manufacturer. ""Instead, the sheriff principal has opted to sully the distinguished reputation of a pilot with an exemplary record who was renowned for his sense of responsibility and his regard for the safety of his crew,"" she said. ""The opportunity for closure and maybe some peace for so many people has been denied."" Following the 32-day inquiry, which heard testimony from families, experts and eyewitnesses, Mr O'Prey's father Ian said he was ""really angry"" at the inquiry's findings and that Capt Traill had been made ""a fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. What we know about the minutes before the tragedy Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions In his findings,external, Mr Turnbull said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" said Sheriff Turnbull. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received.""

Care children sexually abused while missing,"This video can not be played One young person described being taken from a care home and then stripped, beaten and stabbed More than 60 young people were sexually abused or exploited after going missing from unregulated homes, the BBC has learned. Information requests also indicate that missing episodes have doubled in the past three years in England and Wales. The charity Missing People said the government must ""urgently"" address the lack of quality placements. The Department for Education said councils had a duty to make sure accommodation for these children was suitable. Children over the age of 16, often in care or formerly so, are increasingly being placed in unregulated homes in England and Wales. Known as semi-independent or supported accommodation, they offer support but not care to residents. In September, BBC News reported that vulnerable teenagers in unregulated homesface 'organised abuse'while living in such accommodation. Figures indicate that missing episodes have doubled in three years Information requests sent to councils by BBC News indicate that the number of times children and young people have gone missing from unregulated semi-independent accommodation has doubled over a three-year period. The figures that can be compared from 85 councils suggest missing episodes have increased from 4,656 times in 2015/6 to 10,074 in 2018/9. In the same period, councils found that 63 young people were sexually abused or exploited while missing from unregulated homes. Around one in six missing episodes in 2019 featured children already recognised as being at risk from child sexual exploitation. The BBC has also estimated that police forces spent at least Â£50m last year in looking for children in care who have gone missing from their accommodation. Many boys face criminal rather than sexual exploitation. One young man - Kieran, 17 - has been placed in unregulated homes since the age of 15. Despite growing up in central London, he was placed nearly 200 miles away in Wrexham, north Wales. ""There was no family around me, I had no friends"", he says. ""Everyone was coming up to me because they knew I wasn't from the area, asking 'can you do this for me?'"" Within three months of being there his mother died. He says he began working for drug gangs. On one occasion he was kidnapped from outside the home before being moved around the country to help run so-called 'county lines' drug dealing. Have you lived in this type of home? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""All the money I was making was being used to get home to see my family"", he said. He said his life was 'terrible' and he had tried to kill himself on two occasions. ""The care system, social services and government made me feel like I didn't want to be around no more. ""I wanted to see my mum for the last time and get out of this world where no-one cares about me"", he said. The government ""urgently"" needs to address the lack of safe and appropriate placements in areas where children need them, according to Josie Allan, from Missing People. ""Any child who goes missing is at risk of serious harm and this only increases if they are placed in situations where they go missing more often"", she said. ""We are seriously concerned about the number of children being placed a long way from home, in inappropriate or unsafe accommodation."" This video can not be played In September, a BBC News investigation found that vulnerable teenagers face 'organised abuse' in unregulated homes Callum (not his real name) said the homes were often surrounded by drugs and violence. ""The whole road was a drug hotspot, surrounded by crackheads all day long. You want to come home to a safe place"", the 16-year-old said. He said life in a home led to him selling drugs for gangs. ""If I say no to these people they're going to find (someone else) in a care home who's going to do it - it's not a problem for them."" He believes semi-independent accommodation should be more closely scrutinised. ""They need to be watched more, they need to have inspectors and professional people going and regulating the thing. ""You could be running a full-on crack den operation in a care home and no-one would know anything."" Children as young as 11 placed in unregulated care homes Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Rotherham MP Sarah Champion said regulation was a priority. ""Of course, the government needs to regulate semi-independent accommodation"", she said. ""This alone though is not sufficient. The government must recruit and retain more social workers, so that care leavers can benefit from enhanced support."" The Department for Education in England declined to be interviewed but said councils had a legal duty to make sure accommodation for these children was suitable. ""It is unacceptable for any child to be placed in provision that does not meet their needs, for any period of time. ""Local authorities are held accountable for the care they provide to vulnerable children by Ofsted."" Names have been changed to protect identities.

Girl was unsupervised on ride before she drowned,"Evha Jannath fell out of a circular boat on the Splash Canyon attraction A schoolgirl was unsupervised when she fell from a theme park ride to her death, an inquest heard. Evha Jannath, 11, from Leicester, was on a school trip in 2017 when she fell from Splash Canyon at Drayton Manor. Evha, who could not swim, was ""propelled"" from the vessel into 12ft deep water where she drowned. An inquest at South Staffordshire Coroner's Court heard that she stood up on the ride ""at the worst possible time"". CCTV footage played to the inquest jury showed that, despite rules that riders should sit down, Evha was standing and reaching into the water before the circular boat she was in struck a barrier, sending her headfirst into the water. Footage then showed her wading through the water trying to get back to her friends before climbing an ""algae-covered travelator"" and falling off into a ""much deeper"" area of water. The Splash Canyon ride has remained closed since Evha's death The inquest heard she was spotted face down by staff about 11 minutes later before she was pulled out lifeless. It had been her second turn on the ride - her first, accompanied by teachers, had passed ""without incident"", assistant coroner Margaret Jones said. Latest news from the West Midlands Staffordshire Police said the member of staff from Jameah Girls Academy assigned to accompany the group of pupils waited by the exit with another pupil who had not wanted to board the ride. Head teacher Erfana Bora said the teacher acted in line with the school's health and safety policy on the day. She said: ""We can't stipulate teachers must be on rides, as there will be instances where some children would not wish to be on the ride, and so in those cases it's safer overall for the teacher to stay with that child... they make the assumption the park staff are responsible for overall safety on that ride."" Another teacher, Aaminah Rasid Isat, said when the schoolgirls asked if they could go on the ride by themselves, the teachers agreed they were ""safe"" to do so. She said: ""Seeing their behaviour previously on the other rides, we came to a decision they were responsible enough and having been on it once before, they were safe to go on the ride on their own."" Evha died in hospital after suffering chest injuries,however her cause of death has since been changed to drowning. Splash Canyon has been closed since she fell on 9 May 2017.

US notifies UN of Paris climate accord withdrawalNotification begins the one-year process of withdrawing from the landmark climate agreement.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Watch Trump explain why he is pulling the US out of Paris climate accord The US has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, notifying the UN of its intention to leave, as other countries express regret and disappointment at the move. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The US government says the deal puts an ""unfair economic burden"" on Americans. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015, committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C,externalabove pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision to withdraw - taken by President Donald Trump after he came to office in 2017 - made the US the world's sole non-signatory and prompted high-level efforts by the European Union to keep the agreement on track. However, hundreds of local governments, businesses and organisations in the US have joined the We Are Still In movement, pledging to cut emissions and move to renewable energy. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so,external. Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the agreement one of his election campaign pledges but UN rules had meant it was not possible for the US to start the withdrawal process until 4 November 2019. The withdrawal is still subject to the outcome of next year's US presidential election - if Mr Trump loses, the winner may decide to change course. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But scientists and environmentalists fear the effect the Trump administration will have on climate protections in the meantime. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris pullout: The worst is yet to come Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal A report issued in December 2018 by the Institute of International and European Affairs suggestedPresident Trump's decision to leave had done ""very real damage"",externalto the Paris agreement, creating ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"". The decision by the US - one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - drew condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. An official for France's presidential office said ""we regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary."" French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet in Beijing on Wednesday, where they are expected to sign a statement declaring the ""irreversibility of the Paris accord"", the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the US could take more responsibility in what was a multilateral process instead of adding ""negative energy"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, a European Commission spokeswoman responded by saying the agreement was ""here to stay"". ""Its door remains open and we hope the US will join it again one day,"" she said. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for talks Climate change: Are lifestyle changes the only answer? Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House,condemned Mr Trump's move as a ""disastrous decision that sells out our children's future"",external, while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would ""sacrifice the planet for their greed"". ""It is about the darkest moment in American diplomacy in a very, very long time and a huge blow to global efforts,"" Bill McKibben, leader of climate campaign group 350.org, told the BBC's Newsday programme. However, the move was welcomed by Republican congressman Gary Palmer, who tweeted: ""It is high time for the US to leave this overly regulative and burdensome agreement that doesn't really address climate change."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the agreement had imposed an ""unfair economic burden"" on the United States. Instead, he said, the US would follow ""a realistic and pragmatic model"", using ""all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump promised to turn the US into an energy superpower, and has attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He has characterised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Announcing his decision to withdraw in June 2017, Mr Trump said: ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests."" He said the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost economic output and 6.5 million jobs but a US government report last year said that, on the contrary,unchecked climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect  on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

Plaid Cymru's 'ambition for Wales without limit',"This video can not be played Leader Adam Price said returning more Plaid Cymru MPs would make Downing Street 'listen to Wales' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said no other party has a ""higher ambition for Wales"" as he launched its general election campaign on Monday. Mr Price told supporters in Menai Bridge, Anglesey, that Westminster policies had failed Wales. Plaid wants to add to its tally of four MPs, with Ynys Mon a top target, and has not ruled out electoral pacts. It wants another referendum on Brexit in which it would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. In September, Mr Price called for his party to go into a snap pollpromising to cancel Brexitwithout the need for a further referendum, but party members voted to support another vote on membership unless there is a prospect of a no-deal Brexit. What would a Welsh 'remain election pact' mean? General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election ""The key message from us is that for a 100 years we've put our faith in the Westminster parties and where has it got us,"" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price told BBC Wales. ""We're at the bottom of every league table that you care to mention - child poverty is rising and life expectancy is falling. ""The way we can solve things is not by putting our faith in Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson but by putting faith in ourselves and by sending the biggest number ever of Plaid MPs to Westminster"". Jane Dodds (left) won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election after Plaid Cymru and the Green Party did not field candidates In August, Plaid Cymru did not field a candidate in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election after entering a pact with the Liberal Democrats and Green Party to avoid splitting the remain vote. The seatwas won by Lib Dem Jane Dodds, Despite reports they have reached a wider electoral pact for the election on 12 December,Plaid sources said the discussions within and between the parties continue. The party won four seats in the 2017 election, including slender margins of 104 in Ceredigion and 92 in Arfon, while 16 of its 40 candidates lost their deposits after failing to secure 5% of the constituency votes. ButPlaid came second in May's European elections in Walesand beat Labour in a Wales-wide election for the first time. Mr Price said: ""These are unique times... wherever possible we should look to maximise the number of pro-remain MPs"". ""We haven't reached a final agreement yet"", he said, emphasising Plaid was in consultation with local parties. ""This is the right thing to do where it's possible"", he said. ""There are times in politics where you've got to put the public interest and the national interest before narrow party interest. It's painful and it doesn't come naturally, it's the kind of leadership I think people are looking for"". Adam Price launched his party's general election campaign in Anglesey this morning The party is campaigning for a ""Welsh green jobs revolution"", the creation of a Welsh justice system - which includes the transfer of policing powers to Cardiff - and Â£50m to recruit 1,600 new police officers. Other pledges announced ahead of the launch relate to issues that are the responsibility of the Welsh Government - social care, childcare and building affordable homes. Asked whether the party was deliberately confusing matters, a Plaid Cymru source said: ""Many of the issues are decided in Westminster or their funding allocated there. ""The sad fact of the matter, however, is the media still does not understand devolution, so we have to talk about the whole range of issues that matter to people's lives."" Claims about Wales fact-checked Mr Price said Plaid Cymru's ambition for Wales is ""without limit"" and aimed to win the party's most seats at an election. ""We have to take our country from where it's been bumping along at the bottom of every league table you can imagine,"" he said. ""There's nothing inevitable about poverty as a nation. It's the poverty of leadership we've had from the Westminster parties. ""We have to take the opportunity to change that at this election, to back ourselves, believe in ourselves and vote for our party."" Mr Price said Wales has not been taken seriously at Westminster, adding: ""Compare Wales to Scotland and Northern Ireland and we're just invisible in the corridors of Whitehall.""

Who is the new Commons Speaker?,"Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle was regarded as the frontrunner for the role ""A kind of embodiment of the British constitution,"" one Westminster savant told me, the sort of politician who has been marinated in parliamentary practice so long they have an instinctive feel for its unwritten rules and unspoken conventions. To him, Lindsay Hoyle is a classic example of the political operator turned constitutional fixture. His father was an MP (and is now a Labour Peer) and he served as a councillor in his home seat of Chorley in Lancashire, becoming deputy leader, before moving to Parliament in 1997. This is a man steeped in politics. And that shows through in other ways. He is seen in the tea room as a strategic streetwise campaigner, who set his eyes on the prize he won today perhaps a decade ago, when he was one of the first three MPs to be elected as deputy Speaker. ""The by-ways of Lancashire are littered with the bodies of those who've underestimated Lindsay,"" one former parliamentary neighbour told me. There is steel under the cheerful surface. The succession to John Bercow had been a Westminster talking point for at least 18 months, and it was striking how cautious potential competitors were about showing their hand too soon, with Lindsay already spoken of as the commanding frontrunner in that race. When the election finally came, much later than many expected, he played a cautious hand - emphasising his record in the chair, for example during the terror attack on Westminster. Contest to choose new Commons Speaker Commons deputy speaker knighted He has also been the point of contact for MPs concerned about security issues, for themselves, their staff and their families - a vital role in the current political climate. His list of nominators was a careful cross-section of serious backbenchers - balanced on Brexit and on party factions, and on political generations. Lindsay Hoyle with his array of animals, all named after politicians including Dennis and Patrick the cats, Gordon and Betty the dogs, parrot Boris, and tortoise Maggie Heading the list of nominators was Sir Charles Walker, vice chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, and one of those who dragged John Bercow to the chair (I'm told he won't be doing any dragging this time, though). Sir Charles was talked of as a potential candidate himself, so it was quite a coup to have him front and centre, signalling seriousness of purpose and a dash of reform-mindedness to MPs. As chairman of the Commons Procedure Committee, Mr Walker has a shopping list of changes he wants to implement, but he has also shown his disquiet at some of Speaker Bercow's recent rulings, so his support sends a nuanced message. What kind of Speaker will he be? Sir Lindsay has taken the traditional route - serving since 2010 as a deputy, so MPs have had plenty of opportunities to observe his avuncular style, and, on occasion to contrast it favourably with Speaker Bercow's. And as the senior deputy, the Chairman of Ways and Means, he has a guaranteed spot in the limelight every year, chairing the Budget debates (this is a tradition going back to the Stuart kings, when the Speaker was seen as an agent of the Crown, while the deputy was chosen by MPs and therefore seen as more suited to chairing debates on taxation). He also selects amendments to be considered when MPs sit as a Committee of the Whole House, as they did over the Early Election Bill, last week. His decision to rule out amendments not strictly within the compass of the Bill bolstered his reputation as a straight shooter who was not keen on Bercow-esque stretching of the rules. If there is to be change, the likelihood is that it will be by consensus, and probably with the stamp of approval of Sir Charles's committee. But Mr Speaker Hoyle could find himself having to decide, in the heat of controversy, whether to allow some of his predecessor's innovations to continue; extra amendments to the address of thanks for the Queen's Speech (Speaker Bercow's 2013 decision to allow an extra amendment ratcheted up the Commons pressure for an EU referendum), amendments to Business of the House Motions and substantive emergency motions. These all sound like technical in-house issues, but their impact on the politics of the last few years has been enormous. Some of these questions may not arise if there is a stable government majority to vote them down - but, especially if there is a hung Parliament, the new Speaker may have to decide whether to accept or reject some of the precedents that have been set in the last few years. And the consequences could be huge. Even if the next House of Commons has a majority, the chances are that it will not default back to its 2005 factory settings - and MPs will still expect plenty of urgent questions, emergency debates and chances to put their questions at PMQs, and a Speaker who seeks to erase the practice of the last decade may get some pushback. And MPs will also expect their Speaker to stand up to ministers where appropriate - which is a lot more difficult to do where the government has a majority. In conducting debates, his put-downs and shuttings-up will be gentler, and the advice of the clerks - those priests of parliamentary practice - is more likely to be implemented. With a demand for a kinder, gentler politics, this could help the Commons lead the way.

A broadcasting giant in the Republic of Ireland, he hosted the Late Late Show for more than 30 years on the country's national broadcaster RTÃ. Major figures from entertainment and politics paid tribute to him after his death on Monday after a long illness. Irish President Michael D Higgins said Byrne was a ""man of great charisma"", had compassion in abundance and a ""sense of what was just"". Late Late Show reels back the years RTÃ's director general Dee Forbes described him as an exceptional broadcaster with a ""unique and groundbreaking style"". ""He not only defined generations but he deftly arbitrated the growth and development of a nation,"" she said. This video can not be played When Gay Byrne met Boyzone ""Ireland grew up under Gay Byrne and we will never see his like again."" His wife Kathleen and their daughters Crona and Suzy said he died at home surrounded by his family. ""We wish to thank everybody for their love and support during Gay's illness, particularly the wonderful teams in the Mater Hospital, St Francis Hospice and the Irish Cancer Society,"" they said. Gay Byrne interviewed Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams on the Late Late Show in 1994 Gay Byrne, or Gaybo as he was almost universally known, was the leading Irish broadcaster of his era. As anchor of the Late Late Show, he steered the audience through the highs and lows of Irish life. From Ballybunion to Buncrana, he was a familiar and controversial face on Irish screens every Friday night, presiding over the shifting moods of the country. Read more:The leading Irish broadcaster of his era Byrne hosted the Late Late Show - which combined light entertainment and current affairs - in a relaxed but intelligent manner. The show embraced discussion about divorce, abortion and sexuality, which were regarded as controversial subjects in Ireland at the time. It made headlines with highlights such as a 1993 interview with Annie Murphy, who had a child with the former Bishop of Galway Eamon Casey. Byrne's wife Kathleen Watkins - pictured with him in 2015 - said he died surrounded by his family In 1992, the then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke fell foul of the show when he was coaxed into singing Oh My Darling Clementine on a day when seven Protestant workmen were killed in an IRA bomb. Byrne also fronted a long-running radio show that was first known as the Gay Byrne Hour and later the Gay Byrne Show. He also presented the Rose of Tralee pageant, the Housewife of the Year competition and a range of special programmes.

Early in his career he also worked for Granada Television and the BBC. President Higgins said Mr Byrne's work ""shone a light not only on the bright but also the dark sides of Irish life"". ""[He helped] shape our conscience, our self-image and our idea of who we might be,"" added the president. Some of Byrne's fellow broadcasters took to social media to pay tribute to him. Graham Norton, the Irish presenter who hosts TV and radio shows for the BBC, said Byrne ""showed us all how it should be done"". Allow Twitter content?

Bercow's influence hangs over race,"Six of the nine MPs seeking to become Commons Speaker gave their views on the role With the election for the next Speaker of the House of Commons due to happen next month, six of the candidates appeared at an Institute for Government event. Here's what they had to say. John Bercow wasn't there, but his influence was still heavily felt. Six of the nine candidates vying to replace him as Speaker sought to define themselves against the man who has held the job for 10 years. During the discussion, criticism of Mr Bercow's tenure ranged from the subtle to the blunt, with Conservative MP Shailesh Vara labelling him ""a verbal playground bully"". ""He demeans colleagues. He insults them. That cannot continue,"" he said And Labour's Chris Bryant said he would bring an end to ""long lectures from the chair"". Commons Speaker John Bercow to stand down Nine MPs make pitch for Bercow's job Mr Bercow is standing down on 31 October. MPs will elect his replacement on 4 November. One of his current deputies, Dame Eleanor Laing, did not explicitly attack Mr Bercow's manner but said: ""You don't need to be rude to exert discipline."" She added: ""The Speaker needs to exert authority with kindness."" While Conservative Sir Henry Bellingham praised what Mr Bercow had done for backbench MPs, he said a good Speaker should be like ""a good umpire - he should not grandstand"". He also suggested it would be a good thing if the public did not know the name of the Speaker, in contrast to the massive media and social media interest in Mr Bercow. This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House Candidates were also asked how they would change the culture of the House of Commons, including making its members more diverse and the building more accessible. Labour's Meg Hillier lamented the lack of formal advice for MPs going on maternity leave and described Parliament's provisions for breastfeeding and expectant mothers as ""barely legal"". She also called for MPs to get training in how to manage their staff, telling the audience she had heard ""horror stories"" about how some employees had been treated. Former deputy Labour Party leader Harriet Harman is one of nine candidates hoping to replace Mr Bercow And Labour's Harriet Harman said Parliament should have modern employment practices such as bereavement leave. ""You have to be in touch with where the public is going,"" she said. Mr Bryant said he would tackle the unpredictably of the timing of votes, highlighting the difficulty it placed on MPs with caring duties. Mr Vara told the audience that he had come to England as an immigrant at the age of four without being able to speak any English. He said he wanted to send a message to children of any background that ""if that bloke Vara can make it, then I can"". In September, Mr Bercow was criticised for allowing a controversial procedure which gave MPs control of the parliamentary agenda in order to pass a bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit. Asked if they would have done the same, Mr Bryant, Ms Harman and Ms Hillier all said yes, while Sir Henry and Mr Vara said no. Dame Eleanor - who is currently a deputy Speaker - instead heaved a sigh, at which point Ms Harman suggested it was ""not fair to ask her"" the question as she still worked with Mr Bercow. Dame Eleanor said she had sympathy for ""the difficult decision"" Mr Bercow had to make. Unusually for a political hustings, the B-word was hardly mentioned. However, Mr Bryant did admit that ""one of the good reasons for standing as Speaker [a politically neutral role] is that you never have to have a view on Brexit again"". The nine candidates bidding to replace Mr Bercow as Commons Speaker are: Sir Henry Bellingham- Conservative MP for North West Norfolk since 1983 Chris Bryant- former minister and shadow Commons leader; Labour MP for Rhondda since 2001 Harriet Harman- former minister and deputy Labour leader; Labour MP since 1982, for Peckham and its successor constituency Camberwell Meg Hillier- chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and former minister; Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 Sir Lindsay Hoyle- elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2010 Dame Eleanor Laing- elected Conservative MP for Epping Forest in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2013 Sir Edward Leigh- Conservative MP for Gainsborough since 1983; former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Shailesh Vara- Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire since 2005; former Northern Ireland minister Dame Rosie Winterton- elected Labour MP for Doncaster Central in 1997; former Labour chief whip; elected deputy Speaker in 2017 Nine MPs make pitch for Bercow's job Commons Speaker John Bercow to stand down LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Mothercare administration threatens 2,500 UK jobs","Baby goods retailer Mothercare has said it plans to call in administrators to the troubled firm's UK business, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare said,externalits 79 UK stores were ""not capable"" of achieving a sufficient level of profitability and that so far it had failed to find a buyer. It said its stores would continue to trade as normal for the time being. Analysts said Mothercare had been slow to adapt to competition from rivals and the switch to online retailing. Mothercare has already gone through a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. The process enabled the chain to shut 55 shops. Why the UK's shops are closing down Mothercare memories and what went wrong High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost The firm said the decision to appoint administrators was ""a necessary step in the restructuring and refinancing"" of the group. ""Plans are well advanced and being finalised for execution imminently.  A further announcement will be made in due course,"" it said. Aisa Kara said Mothercare's online offering was not as strong as competitors Aisa Kara's parenting journey started in Mothercare when she used its Babybond ultrasound scanning service. ""I was so anxious waiting for my 12-week scan, and I don't think either of us could believe it was actually happening, so we booked our private appointment,"" she said. ""Everything was OK and we viewed a heartbeat, so we left elated, and as it was in Mothercare we got to buy our first item of baby clothing at the same time. ""We bought all our nursery items and pushchair from there, and my daughter and son have been dressed in Mothercare almost exclusively. ""The baby clothing is beautiful and I love the vintage styles. My only complaint is that the online experience isn't as good as you would have expected from a company trying to keep up with the market."" Other parents recall their Mothercare memories. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""Usdaw is providing our members in Mothercare with the support, representation and advice they need at this difficult and uncertain time. ""We will urge the administrators to treat the staff with dignity and respect, keep them fully informed through the administration process, do everything possible to save jobs and keep as many stores open as possible and prioritise stabilising the business to provide a more certain future."" It is understood Mothercare is in advanced talks to move its pension schemes from its British operations over to its international parent company which remains profitable. As first reported by Sky, the aim is to stop the schemes being placed in the Pension Protection Fund, which would likely result in cuts for members. The company operates in more than 40 overseas territories, which are not subject to administration. In the financial year to March 2019, Mothercare's international business generated profits of Â£28.3m, whereas the UK retail operations lost Â£36.3m. In its heyday, Mothercare had hundreds of stores.  It was the go-to place for new parents.  But it failed to keep up with our changing shopping habits.  Mothercare's UK arm has been loss-making for years.  One big reason is there's so much more competition these days. From Zara and H&M to the major supermarkets, there are no shortages of places to buy children's clothing and often at cheaper prices.  And then there's online, with the likes of Amazon who are able to deliver basic kit to your doorstep within hours of ordering. It has all eaten into Mothercare's market share. Truth is, this is a business that's been losing money for a very long time. Last year's CVA wasn't enough to turn things around.  Mothercare ran out of time and money to try to revive its fortunes. Mothercare's move comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Retail analyst Steve Dresser told the BBC that like collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook, Mothercare had failed to adapt to the world of online retail. ""They got very used to fat margins and a way of trading that's store-based,"" he said. However, the firm had also lost its way on the High Street, with poor store environments that deterred customers.  Ultimately, he said, people did not think of Mothercare first when it came to buying baby goods: ""I think you would be hard-pressed to know what the brand stands for."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mothercare had become ""a byword for trouble on the High Street"", demonstrating ""the failure of well-established brands to stay afloat"". She added: ""Other retailers, particularly those who have also previously filed for CVAs, will be concerned that these restructuring plans haven't succeeded and a more radical approach may be required in order to survive."" Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""This is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the High Street... the cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits. ""Years of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.""

Two left in contest for new Commons Speaker,"This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House MPs are voting between the final two candidates to succeed John Bercow as Speaker, in what is the first election for the post in more than a decade. In the third round of voting Sir Lindsay Hoyle received the most votes at 267, followed by Chris Bryant with 169 and Dame Eleanor Laing was eliminated with 127. The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. The result of the final ballot is expected about 20:00 GMT. Seven candidates were originally in the running. Having received the least number of votes, Dame Rosie Winterton had to leave the contest in the second round of voting and Harriet Harman voluntarily withdrew her candidacy. Labour MP Meg Hillier and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh were knocked out in the first round of the contest after receiving 10 and 11 votes respectively. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. LIVE: Speaker contest under way Ken Clarke is leading the proceedings The first to speak was Labour's Dame Rosie Winterton. She said the Speaker's job was ""not to dominate proceedings or speak for Parliament"", and promised to ""douse the flames not pour petrol on them"". Another Labour MP Chris Bryant said he believed in ""a Speaker who will stand by the rules, who is completely impartial and who knows Erskine May [the parliamentary rule book] back to front"", adding: ""I've got it lying by my bedside."" He also pledged to end clapping in the chamber and ""sort out the wi-fi"" - pledges that were themselves met with clapping from those listening. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker How MPs will choose the next Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said a Speaker should ""submerge their character in the job"" and be ""a quiet voice"". He also said the preservation of parliamentary buildings should be done ""in the interests of our paymaster - the taxpayers"". ""We cannot waste billions of pounds,"" he said. Current deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing expressed sadness at the number of MPs deciding not to run again at the December election and vowed to stand up for all members if selected for the job. She said Parliament needed to ""escape from the hierarchical structures that allow bullying to take root"". Also addressing the subject of bullying, Labour's Meg Hillier said MPs needed to protect staff in the House, warning bullying ""will become the next expenses scandal"". Mr Bercow was criticised for not doing more to tackle allegations of bullying and harassment in the Commons, and was himself accused of mistreating several members of staff, which he denied. Chris Bryant admitted to keeping a book on parliamentary procedure by his bedside Another current deputy Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said he had introduced security measures for MPs ""so we can feel safe"". ""I will not let you down,"" he promised MPs. Former deputy leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman was last to make her pitch, promising to take on a fourth deputy drawn from one of the smaller parties. She said she had ""an unparallel record of reform"", pointing to her campaign to allow pregnant MPs and new parents to vote by proxy. The candidates made their pitches under the gaze of former Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Labour MP Stella Creasy got a picture of the baroness sitting in the gallery Allow Instagram content?

Candidates needed the support of at least 12 MPs, three of whom have to be from a different party, in order to be eligible to take part. MPs have 20 minutes to vote in a secret ballot. It will take about 45 minutes to count them. If no candidate receives more half of the votes, the individual who receives the least votes will drop out, as will anyone who obtains less than 5% of the total cast. After each round, there will be a 10-minute period for candidates to withdraw. MPs will then continue to vote until one candidate obtains more than half of the votes. The process is being overseen by Ken Clarke, who as Father of the House is the long-serving MP in the Commons. Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle is regarded as the frontrunner for the role Labour's Harriet Harman has said she wants to put an end to ""the Old Boys' Club"" in Parliament Dame Eleanor Laing has said she would ""do things differently"" from Mr Bercow The seven contenders at the start of the race were: Chris Bryant- former minister and shadow Commons leader; Labour MP for Rhondda since 2001 Harriet Harman- former minister and deputy Labour leader; Labour MP since 1982, for Peckham and its successor constituency Camberwell Meg Hillier- chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and former minister; Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 Sir Lindsay Hoyle- elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2010 Dame Eleanor Laing- elected Conservative MP for Epping Forest in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2013 Sir Edward Leigh- Conservative MP for Gainsborough since 1983; former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Dame Rosie Winterton- elected Labour MP for Doncaster Central in 1997; former Labour chief whip; elected deputy Speaker in 2017 BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said most observers believed Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - was the frontrunner. ""As Chairman of Ways and Means, he chairs Budget debates and selects amendments for committee stage proceedings on bills, and has had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his credentials,"" our correspondent says. Sir Lindsay said MPs backing him included Conservative Charles Walker, who was one of Mr Bercow's key allies during his tenure, former sports minister Tracey Crouch and Brexit-backing Labour MP Caroline Flint.

The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked. By Mark D'Arcy, the BBC's parliamentary correspondent So what might MPs want in a new Speaker? First, there seems be an appetite for a different style - an end to Bercow-esque grandiloquence and those five-minute appeals for brevity, as well as for an end to the kind of clashes with MPs that the departed Speaker was prone to. Remember his red-faced finger-jabbing clash with the then Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, or this week's spat with long-time Bercow critic Andrew Bridgen? Then there's the much more important concern about the Speaker's sweeping powers to make the rules in the Commons, a power which saw him permitting amendments to Business of the House motions which were supposed to be taken ""forthwith"" - which many MPs believed meant they could not be amended. Given no one party has a majority in the House, the winning candidate will be the one most capable of reaching across party lines, and building a majority out of factions of the main parties, the members of the smaller parties and their personal supporters. Those seen as party gladiators first and foremost may find that hard to do.

Why UK shops are closing down,"Hardly a month goes by without news of another wave of shops shutting or of stores losing money. Retailers are holding on to more space than they can pay for, and costs are shooting up, reports suggest. So, what is behind the High Street crisis? Fashion chains Karen Millen and Coast recently announced closures. They had more than 100 outlets and concessions between them. The fast-growing online fashion chain Boohoo snapped up the brands following their collapse. But Boohoo isn't interested in owning and running physical stores and so relaunched them as online-only retailers. The number of empty shops already stands at a record high. In Julythe proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015. Last year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went bust and vanished altogether. New research also indicates the top 150 UK retailers have 20% more store space than they need and can afford. Some shops such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look have done restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them. In many ways, retail is a pretty simple business. You have to sell things for more than you paid for them But in the past few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers. Department stores such as Debenhams have been struggling with soaring costs Companies have had to deal with rising costs. Researchers at A&M and Retail Economics suggest during the past five years, companies have had to spend 10.8% more on things such as business rates, increasing wages and rents. And, at the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to rapidly changing shopping habits. Consumers now spend one in every five pounds online - and if businesses are seeing 20% fewer sales on the shop floor as well as their fixed costs rising, then profit margins will be squeezed. Online spending usually peaks around the festive season This huge shift in spending is making businesses think again about how they make money. Too many retailers either fail or are unable to adapt. Those with underlying problems have suffered. Take Debenhams, it's been struggling for years. Its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt and it was tied into long leases. Another department store, House of Fraser, was rescued last year by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. He outlined a plan to create the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and said about 80% of the stores would remain open. But he's now admitted the business was losing more than Â£1m a week. Consumers are spending increasing amounts of their disposable income on experiences and lifestyle. Being mediocre isn't good enough anymore. Shoppers are making fewer visits to High Streets. The retail analytics company Springboard tracks footfall in main towns and cities. It's seen a decline in numbers for the past few years. Bad weather and a reduced appetite for spending by consumers have played a role along the way. Consumers are still shopping, of course. But even with the rise of online, shops need people to walk through the door. From March 2016 to 2019, UK retail lost 106,000 jobs according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Those figures are based on data from the Office for National Statistics. Poundworld saw the biggest job losses, with more than 5,000 redundancies. Toys R Us and Maplin also lost 5,500 jobs between them. This year, the fallout from various restructurings includes 1,000 job losses andplunging profits at Sir Philip Green's Arcadia groupand 100 redundancies at the fashion retailer LK Bennett. More job losses will come.More than two years ago, the BRC warnedthere would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade. Although the first half of this year saw a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on British High Streets, there were some bright spots. Takeaways, gyms and specialist vaping shops were some categories that saw the largest increases in store openings. Analysts have said this demonstrates the High Street's move away from traditional retailing. Supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are two of the big names also continuing to open lots of stores. But the overall picture is the UK has too many shops, they're too big and in the wrong locations.

No Russia interference report until after election,"President Vladimir Putin has denied claims of Russian interference A report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy will not be published until after the election. It has gone through the standard security clearance process, but sources say No 10 is stalling on releasing it. Ex-terrorism watchdog Lord Anderson said any further delay would ""invite suspicion"" of the government's motives in the run-up to next month's election. Ministers said the report would be published ""in due course"" in line with procedures for ""sensitive"" information. The report examines Russian activity including allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections. The BBC's Mark Urban said the delay would increase concerns the report would be ""buried"". The report, written by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external However, approval for its publication has yet to be given and this now looks highly unlikely before Parliament is dissolved on Tuesday. The chairman of the committee, Dominic Grieve, says there is no legitimate reason for delaying it and that voters have a right to see its conclusions before they go to the polls on 12 December. ""We continue to be very disappointed by the failure of the government to publish this report and to provide any explanation as to why it should not be published. Explanations currently advanced that the timing are too short are entirely disingenuous and grossly misleading,"" he told the BBC. The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election.

Several MPs and peers believe No 10 is sitting on the report for political reasons ahead of the election. Raising the issue in the Lords, Lord Anderson, the former reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said concerns over security could not be used as an excuse for non-publication as all the necessary redactions had taken place. ""This unjustified delay undermines the ISC, it invites suspicion of the government and its motives. Will the minister urge No 10 to think again?"" The former head of the Foreign Office, Lord Ricketts, said claims that the government needed time to respond was a red herring given that it had 60 days in which to do so under existing conventions. He said there was a ""clear public interest"" for publication ""in the national security implications of Russia's adversarial conduct"". The BBC understands that, if previous practice was followed, the report will have been vetted by the intelligence agencies before being referred to Downing Street. People familiar with the committee's workings say 10 days should have been adequate for it to be ""cleared"". Mr Grieve said the report was highly relevant given the scale of Russian interference in elections in other countries, notably the 2016 US Presidential election. But Earl Howe said the established protocols had to be followed and there was no case for ""accelerating"" the report's release. ""The length of time the government has had this report is not at all unusual,"" he told the Lords. ""The prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains."" But he added: ""Having said all that, I do realize that the subject of this report is a matter of particular public interest. And I have no doubt that level Lords comments will not be lost on those in Number 10.""

'Why I plan to sue Asda over new contract',"Duncan Carson is taking advice from his union after rejecting the new terms Duncan Carson has just lost his job as a baker at an Asda store near Stoke, but he is preparing to put up a fight. He is among the Asda workers who have been sacked after refusing to sign up to new contracts, but he aims to take the supermarket to an employment tribunal. ""I think someone should stand up to them,"" he said. ""What is the point in having a contract if they can unilaterally change it?"" Asda gave its workers until midnight on Saturday to agree to new terms, which include unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice. The supermarket said 120,000 workers had agreed to the deal, and that fewer than 300 had yet to sign up to the new contract. But Mr Carson, who has worked for Asda for 13 years, said the new contract was ""unacceptable"". ""I have an appointment with my union officer on Thursday to start the process,"" he said. He usually works from 06:00 until noon as a baker, which he says suits him as he is used to working mornings. The new contract means he can be asked to work any hours from 05:00 until midnight. The move will destroy trust in the business, he says. While the new terms stipulate that Asda must give four weeks' notice of new shift patterns, ""what will stop them changing it again?"" he asks. Asda has extended its deadline to accept the new term by a week, meaning workers who return can do so on the new terms. Those who do not will remain sacked, however. ""We have been clear that we do not want anyone to leave us as a result of this necessary change and so we have written to the fewer than 300 colleagues who have not signed the contract to offer a little more time to sign up and continue to work with us, should they wish,"" the company said. It added that it had always been clear that it understood people had responsibilities outside of work and would ""always help them to balance these with their work life"". Asda workers are 'terrified for their jobs' Asda's contract changes are 'just not fair' Neil Derrick, GMB regional officer for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, said his union would offer advice on what legal challenges his members can mount. ""We are working with every individual member with a view to lodging a claim,"" he said, which might be based on unfair dismissal, sex discrimination or potentially disability discrimination. Many Asda workers are women who are on part-time contracts to fit in with looking after family members, he added. ""This new contract completely turns that on its head,"" he said. However, Sarah Crowther, a barrister at Outer Temple Chambers, noted that other retailers had made similar contract changes and that they were perfectly legal. She said employees that refused to accept the changes had two potential ways to make a claim: unfair dismissal or indirect discrimination. ""Those with two years of qualifying employment could bring a claim for unfair dismissal. In that situation it would depend on whether the tribunal was satisfied that there was a good business reason and that procedurally everything had been done with adequate consultation,"" she told the BBC's Today Programme. Ms Crowther added that people ""disproportionately affected"" by the change such as ""those less able to accommodate the flexibility... might have a case, but then it would be open to an employer to justify that"". Last week, Leeds-based Asda said it was increasing its hourly pay rates. The supermarket said it would raise its basic rate for its hourly-paid retail employees to Â£9.18 an hour from 1 April next year, following an increase to Â£9 from 3 November. In London, which has an additional allowance to reflect the higher cost of living, basic pay will increase to Â£10.31 an hour. The retailer, owned by Walmart, acknowledged that the announcement for April pay rises had come earlier that usual.

"Tories stand by candidate over Facebook postFrancesca O'Brien apologises for saying people on the programme Benefits Street ""need putting down"".Wales politics","Francesca O'Brien admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"" A Conservative general election candidate has apologised for a Facebook post in which she said people on a TV show needed ""putting down"". Francesca O'Brien, who is running for the Gower seat in December's election, made the comments about Channel 4's Benefits Street in January 2014. Ms O'Brien said her comments were made ""off the cuff"" but admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"". Labour and the Lib Dems called for the candidate to be dropped. But Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies has stood by Ms O'Brien, who is still set to run in the general election on 12 December. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine voters in Gower backing such a candidate, while a Tory peer has said the candidate should consider her position. The former commissioned officer with the RAF Air Cadets was selected to be the Conservative party candidate for Gower in October after an open primary in which residents were able to participate as opposed to just party members. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election Having lost Gower to Labour in the 2017 election, the seat is a top Tory target in Wales. In the posts following the broadcast of the first episode of Benefits Street five years ago, Ms O'Brien said: ""Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!"" Responding to another user's comment, she said: ""My blood is boiling, these people need putting down."" The Conservatives won Gower - which Labour held for more than 100 years - in 2015, but lost it in the 2017 snap election In a statement released on Sunday, Ms O'Brien said: ""These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. ""However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the Today programme what Ms O'Brien said was ""clearly wrong"", adding it was important she had apologised. Asked if Ms O'Brien should stand, she said: ""I think that would be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next Member of Parliament."" But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine ""decent people"" in the constituency backing a candidate with ""views of that sort"". ""I think she is condemned out of her own mouth more eloquently than anything I could say,"" Mr Drakeford told his monthly press conference. Ian Lavery, Labour Party chairman, said: ""Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer.Â ""The cuts to benefits and Universal Credit programme that Therese Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty."" He said Ms O'Brien's candidacy was ""shameful"". Speaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said he thought Ms O'Brien's comments were ""awful"". ""I'm sure she does too,"" he added. ""I do think she should consider her position."" Byron Davies said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process The chairman of the Welsh Conservatives said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process. Lord Davies - a former MP for the constituency - said: ""The comments were inadvisable, obviously, but made in the heat of the moment watching a television programme. ""But I don't condone it in any shape or form. However, this is a dredging exercise on the part of the Labour Party whose candidate in the Gower doesn't want to talk about Brexit."" Benefits Street, which featured the residents of James Turner Street in Birmingham, was a ratings hit for Channel 4 when it was broadcast. But a total of 887 viewers complained to the broadcasting regulator, claiming the show had vilified and misrepresented benefits claimants. Ofcom decided the programmedid not breach broadcastingrules. Ms O'Brien is due to stand against Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi, Plaid Cymru's John Davies and Sam Bennett of the Liberal Democrats. Other parties are yet to confirm their candidates. Mr Davies invited Ms O'Brien to join him on a soup run ""to see how real people have been affected by Tory cuts to public housing"". Lib Dem Mr Bennett called for her to step down, adding: ""These kind of comments show the Tories are still very much the nasty party.""

Care children sexually abused while missingMore than 60 young people have been sexually abused or exploited while missing from unregulated homes.UK,"This video can not be played One young person described being taken from a care home and then stripped, beaten and stabbed More than 60 young people were sexually abused or exploited after going missing from unregulated homes, the BBC has learned. Information requests also indicate that missing episodes have doubled in the past three years in England and Wales. The charity Missing People said the government must ""urgently"" address the lack of quality placements. The Department for Education said councils had a duty to make sure accommodation for these children was suitable. Children over the age of 16, often in care or formerly so, are increasingly being placed in unregulated homes in England and Wales. Known as semi-independent or supported accommodation, they offer support but not care to residents. In September, BBC News reported that vulnerable teenagers in unregulated homesface 'organised abuse'while living in such accommodation. Figures indicate that missing episodes have doubled in three years Information requests sent to councils by BBC News indicate that the number of times children and young people have gone missing from unregulated semi-independent accommodation has doubled over a three-year period. The figures that can be compared from 85 councils suggest missing episodes have increased from 4,656 times in 2015/6 to 10,074 in 2018/9. In the same period, councils found that 63 young people were sexually abused or exploited while missing from unregulated homes. Around one in six missing episodes in 2019 featured children already recognised as being at risk from child sexual exploitation. The BBC has also estimated that police forces spent at least Â£50m last year in looking for children in care who have gone missing from their accommodation. Many boys face criminal rather than sexual exploitation. One young man - Kieran, 17 - has been placed in unregulated homes since the age of 15. Despite growing up in central London, he was placed nearly 200 miles away in Wrexham, north Wales. ""There was no family around me, I had no friends"", he says. ""Everyone was coming up to me because they knew I wasn't from the area, asking 'can you do this for me?'"" Within three months of being there his mother died. He says he began working for drug gangs. On one occasion he was kidnapped from outside the home before being moved around the country to help run so-called 'county lines' drug dealing. Have you lived in this type of home? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external ""All the money I was making was being used to get home to see my family"", he said. He said his life was 'terrible' and he had tried to kill himself on two occasions. ""The care system, social services and government made me feel like I didn't want to be around no more. ""I wanted to see my mum for the last time and get out of this world where no-one cares about me"", he said. The government ""urgently"" needs to address the lack of safe and appropriate placements in areas where children need them, according to Josie Allan, from Missing People. ""Any child who goes missing is at risk of serious harm and this only increases if they are placed in situations where they go missing more often"", she said. ""We are seriously concerned about the number of children being placed a long way from home, in inappropriate or unsafe accommodation."" This video can not be played In September, a BBC News investigation found that vulnerable teenagers face 'organised abuse' in unregulated homes Callum (not his real name) said the homes were often surrounded by drugs and violence. ""The whole road was a drug hotspot, surrounded by crackheads all day long. You want to come home to a safe place"", the 16-year-old said. He said life in a home led to him selling drugs for gangs. ""If I say no to these people they're going to find (someone else) in a care home who's going to do it - it's not a problem for them."" He believes semi-independent accommodation should be more closely scrutinised. ""They need to be watched more, they need to have inspectors and professional people going and regulating the thing. ""You could be running a full-on crack den operation in a care home and no-one would know anything."" Children as young as 11 placed in unregulated care homes Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Rotherham MP Sarah Champion said regulation was a priority. ""Of course, the government needs to regulate semi-independent accommodation"", she said. ""This alone though is not sufficient. The government must recruit and retain more social workers, so that care leavers can benefit from enhanced support."" The Department for Education in England declined to be interviewed but said councils had a legal duty to make sure accommodation for these children was suitable. ""It is unacceptable for any child to be placed in provision that does not meet their needs, for any period of time. ""Local authorities are held accountable for the care they provide to vulnerable children by Ofsted."" Names have been changed to protect identities.

Judges lambast officials over deadly Delhi smog,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey shows what it's like driving through the high levels of smog in Delhi India's top court has accused state governments of ""passing the buck"" on air pollution and failing to take action to tackle Delhi's toxic smog. The Supreme Court said authorities were only interested in ""gimmicks"", rather than concrete measures to combat pollution levels. Levels of dangerous particles in the air - known as PM2.5 - are at well over 10 times safe limits in the capital. City authorities have responded by launching a car rationing system. The fight against air pollution in three global cities ""Delhi is choking every year and we are unable to do anything,"" said Supreme Court Justice Arun Mishra. ""The state machinery is not actingâ¦ They are passing the buck to each other... Everybody is interested in gimmicks and elections."" From 4 to 15 November, cars with odd or even number plates will only be allowed on the roads on alternate days, officials said. Such a system has been used before but it is not clear if it helps lower pollution levels. This video can not be played 'It's making us sick but we have nowhere to go': Delhi's homeless sleep in the smog Cars are not believed to be the main cause of Delhi's toxic air, with experts pointing instead to crop burning by farmers in neighbouring states to clear fields. Health officials have asked people to stay indoors and refrain from doing any physical activity as millions are at risk of respiratory illness. Schools are closed until Tuesday and the shutdown is likely to be extended until Friday as the city chokes under a thick blanket of smog. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the car rationing system, known as the ""odd-even plan"", would take hundreds of thousands of cars off the road. Those ignoring the rule face a fine of 4,000 rupees (Â£44; $56) - double that of previous years. by Krutika Pathi, BBC News, Delhi Teary eyes, a throat like sandpaper, and a hacking cough that left me breathless - these were the side effects after I went for a walk around my neighbourhood in Delhi. Whenever ""pollution season"" starts to set in, I notice the changes in my body rather quickly. I've lost count of the number of times I've woken up with a severe cough during the winter season. From your nose to your chest, it feels like things aren't working the way they should be. On some days, it's just a blocked nose and on others, it's almost a struggle to breathe normally. The effects go beyond the physical too. I'm constantly thinking about Air Quality Index numbers and whether the air is breathable - I even activate my air purifier via an app as I leave work so that my room has clean air by the time I'm home. ""The perfect storm of conditions during November has created almost 30% higher atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter,"" said a Cornell University study published in July. Delhi's geography - it is landlocked and sits on a flat plain that is blocked off by the Himalayas - means it is more drastically affected. Only public transport, emergency vehicles, taxis and two-wheelers will be allowed. Women driving alone will also be exempt from the rule. The Supreme Court has ordered Delhi's state government to produce data which proves that the car rationing system works. Experts say emissions from vehicles are just one of several factors that have turned the city into - in Mr Kejriwal's words - a ""gas chamber"". A major cause of the high pollution levels at this time of year is farmers in neighbouring states burning crop stubble to clear their fields. This creates a lethal cocktail of particulate matter and gases - carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide - all worsened by fireworks set off during the Hindu festival of Diwali a week ago. Construction and industrial emissions have also contributed to the smog. How a food crisis led to Delhi's foul smog Millions of masks given out in 'gas chamber' Delhi Delhi's foul air came from India's farming revolution How do Ultra Low Emissions Zones work? Efforts to identify a cause have sparked a row between state and federal politicians, with Mr Kejriwal calling on the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana to crack down on crop burning. Federal Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar accused Mr Kejriwal of politicising the issue and painting his neighbours as ""villains"". The Supreme Court also summoned the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states to appear before it to answer questions about efforts to tackle stubble burning. The level of PM2.5 - tiny particulates that can enter deep into the lungs - was at one point seven times higher than in the Chinese capital Beijing, which has battled similar pollution problems in recent years. Five million masks were handed out in schoolson Friday as officials declared a public health emergency. Part of the reason is a change in crop cycles and harvesting in the agricultural states of Punjab and Haryana. A decade ago the two states passed identical laws intended to preserve ground water, which effectively compelled farmers to plant their rice crops in mid-June rather than at the end of April, as was the tradition. This was to enable them to make use of monsoonal rains to grow the heavily water-dependent crop. A traffic policeman wears a mask to protect himself at a busy junction The delay in the planting cycle meant the harvesting cycle was also delayed. Farmers now have much less time to prepare their fields for the next crop cycle and burning stubble is a cheap and effective way to clear the land. Unfortunately, this coincides with changing wind patterns over Delhi and the rest of north India. India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has recommended some guidelines for residents of Delhi to cope with the elevated smog levels. They include avoiding strenuous activities and hard labour if possible, and exercising indoors. When outdoors, avoiding main roads and congested areas can help, as smaller roads and bylanes tend to be less polluted. Wearing a mask can help filter out pollutants, but simple surgical masks or comfort masks will not. A smog mask with a respirator is recommended. Do not burn rubbish or other discarded items outdoors, and try to avoid or share car trips to reduce the number of cars on the road. Are you in Delhi?

Call to decriminalise personal drug possession,"Proposals to introduce drug consumption rooms in Glasgow have been blocked The possession of illicit drugs for personal use should be decriminalised, a report by MPs has said. The Scottish Affairs Committee also recommended the UK government should back safe consumption rooms in Scotland in a bid to tackle drug misuse. Drug-related deaths in Scotland reached an all-time high of 1,187 last year. The Home Office said it had no plans to decriminalise drug possession and that doing so would not eliminate crime associated with the illicit drug trade. All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? However, the committee of 12 Scottish MPs said the government must be open to taking radical steps after the latest figures showed Scotland's death rate from overdoses was far more than the rest of the UK and higher than any other EU country. The cross-party committee, chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart, included four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs. Mr Wishart told BBC's Good Morning Scotland Programme: ""It's disappointing to see such a knee jerk response from the Home Office. ""This is a carefully considered piece of work, the most in-depth inquiry into problem drug use in Scotland ever conducted. ""Criminalising drug users is counter-productive and we need to review it now. We need to pull the big levers and affect big change."" Many of those who died had taken a cocktail of heroin and pills They cross-party committee conducted what they called one of the most extensive inquiries ever carried out into problem drug use in Scotland. Their recommendations include the decriminalisation of drugs for personal use and new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilities. It said that if the UK government refused to change the law, the relevant powers should be devolved to Scotland. The report also said the Scottish government must do more to ensure drug treatment services were properly funded and supported. The Daily Record has been campaigning for decriminalisation of drug use The UK government currently treats drugs as a criminal justice matter, but the Scottish MPs heard this approach was often counter-productive. They want the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use not to be a criminal matter. It would still be illegal to supply drugs and police resources should be concentrated on that, they said. The MPs, who also gathered evidence in Portugal and Canada, found that decriminalisation was a ""public health"" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment. They called for the Department for Health and Social Care to take over lead responsibility for drugs policy from the Home Office. It is three years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city, but the idea has been blocked by the Home Office. Sometimes dubbed ""fix rooms"", they would be the first of their kind in the UK, with the aim being to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special site would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. The committee report said there was overwhelming evidence that fix rooms reduced the health risks, but they were not a ""silver bullet"" for problem drug use. The MPs expressed ""deep regret"" that the Home Office had chosen to block the Glasgow plan and said the UK government's reasons for doing so were ""not convincing"". The MPs said that drugs legislation was reserved to Westminster, but the Scottish government could be doing more on the delivery of drug-related health treatment. The report said Scottish government decisions, such as cutting funding for Alcohol and Drug Partnerships, had made the situation worse. Health services for problem drug use in Scotland must be properly funded, they said. The Scottish government said it welcomed support for the introduction of a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow as part of efforts to reduce deaths there. A spokeswoman added: ""The outdated Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 should be amended to allow us to implement a range of public health focused responses, including the introduction of safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. ""We call on the incoming UK government to amend the Act or to devolve those powers to Scotland.""

Contest to choose new Commons Speaker under way,"This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House MPs are voting between the final two candidates to succeed John Bercow as Speaker, in what is the first election for the post in more than a decade. In the third round of voting Sir Lindsay Hoyle received the most votes at 267, followed by Chris Bryant with 169 and Dame Eleanor Laing was eliminated with 127. The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. The result of the final ballot is expected about 20:00 GMT. Seven candidates were originally in the running. Having received the least number of votes, Dame Rosie Winterton had to leave the contest in the second round of voting and Harriet Harman voluntarily withdrew her candidacy. Labour MP Meg Hillier and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh were knocked out in the first round of the contest after receiving 10 and 11 votes respectively. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. LIVE: Speaker contest under way Ken Clarke is leading the proceedings The first to speak was Labour's Dame Rosie Winterton. She said the Speaker's job was ""not to dominate proceedings or speak for Parliament"", and promised to ""douse the flames not pour petrol on them"". Another Labour MP Chris Bryant said he believed in ""a Speaker who will stand by the rules, who is completely impartial and who knows Erskine May [the parliamentary rule book] back to front"", adding: ""I've got it lying by my bedside."" He also pledged to end clapping in the chamber and ""sort out the wi-fi"" - pledges that were themselves met with clapping from those listening. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker How MPs will choose the next Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said a Speaker should ""submerge their character in the job"" and be ""a quiet voice"". He also said the preservation of parliamentary buildings should be done ""in the interests of our paymaster - the taxpayers"". ""We cannot waste billions of pounds,"" he said. Current deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing expressed sadness at the number of MPs deciding not to run again at the December election and vowed to stand up for all members if selected for the job. She said Parliament needed to ""escape from the hierarchical structures that allow bullying to take root"". Also addressing the subject of bullying, Labour's Meg Hillier said MPs needed to protect staff in the House, warning bullying ""will become the next expenses scandal"". Mr Bercow was criticised for not doing more to tackle allegations of bullying and harassment in the Commons, and was himself accused of mistreating several members of staff, which he denied. Chris Bryant admitted to keeping a book on parliamentary procedure by his bedside Another current deputy Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said he had introduced security measures for MPs ""so we can feel safe"". ""I will not let you down,"" he promised MPs. Former deputy leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman was last to make her pitch, promising to take on a fourth deputy drawn from one of the smaller parties. She said she had ""an unparallel record of reform"", pointing to her campaign to allow pregnant MPs and new parents to vote by proxy. The candidates made their pitches under the gaze of former Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Labour MP Stella Creasy got a picture of the baroness sitting in the gallery Allow Instagram content?

Candidates needed the support of at least 12 MPs, three of whom have to be from a different party, in order to be eligible to take part. MPs have 20 minutes to vote in a secret ballot. It will take about 45 minutes to count them. If no candidate receives more half of the votes, the individual who receives the least votes will drop out, as will anyone who obtains less than 5% of the total cast. After each round, there will be a 10-minute period for candidates to withdraw. MPs will then continue to vote until one candidate obtains more than half of the votes. The process is being overseen by Ken Clarke, who as Father of the House is the long-serving MP in the Commons. Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle is regarded as the frontrunner for the role Labour's Harriet Harman has said she wants to put an end to ""the Old Boys' Club"" in Parliament Dame Eleanor Laing has said she would ""do things differently"" from Mr Bercow The seven contenders at the start of the race were: Chris Bryant- former minister and shadow Commons leader; Labour MP for Rhondda since 2001 Harriet Harman- former minister and deputy Labour leader; Labour MP since 1982, for Peckham and its successor constituency Camberwell Meg Hillier- chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and former minister; Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 Sir Lindsay Hoyle- elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2010 Dame Eleanor Laing- elected Conservative MP for Epping Forest in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2013 Sir Edward Leigh- Conservative MP for Gainsborough since 1983; former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Dame Rosie Winterton- elected Labour MP for Doncaster Central in 1997; former Labour chief whip; elected deputy Speaker in 2017 BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said most observers believed Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - was the frontrunner. ""As Chairman of Ways and Means, he chairs Budget debates and selects amendments for committee stage proceedings on bills, and has had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his credentials,"" our correspondent says. Sir Lindsay said MPs backing him included Conservative Charles Walker, who was one of Mr Bercow's key allies during his tenure, former sports minister Tracey Crouch and Brexit-backing Labour MP Caroline Flint.

The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked. By Mark D'Arcy, the BBC's parliamentary correspondent So what might MPs want in a new Speaker? First, there seems be an appetite for a different style - an end to Bercow-esque grandiloquence and those five-minute appeals for brevity, as well as for an end to the kind of clashes with MPs that the departed Speaker was prone to. Remember his red-faced finger-jabbing clash with the then Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, or this week's spat with long-time Bercow critic Andrew Bridgen? Then there's the much more important concern about the Speaker's sweeping powers to make the rules in the Commons, a power which saw him permitting amendments to Business of the House motions which were supposed to be taken ""forthwith"" - which many MPs believed meant they could not be amended. Given no one party has a majority in the House, the winning candidate will be the one most capable of reaching across party lines, and building a majority out of factions of the main parties, the members of the smaller parties and their personal supporters. Those seen as party gladiators first and foremost may find that hard to do.

Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election. This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list.

How much does a general election cost?,"Parliament will be dissolved on Wednesday, so the 2019 general election campaign will then officially get under way. So what are the rules for parties and MPs on spending in the run-up to polling day on 12 December? In the run-up to an election, there are rules around campaign spending to try to keep the race fair. They can sometimes be vague, but they cover spending by political parties in the year before a general election - and can also include polling day. Each party must record and report all campaign spending to the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections. This includes money spent on: Advertising of any kind - from YouTube videos to banners Leaflets or letters sent to voters' homes A manifesto, or other documents that set out a party's policies Press conferences, rallies and related expenses Transport to party events Political parties' spend is also capped at Â£30,000 for each constituency that it contests in a general election. So if a party stood a candidate in each of the 650 UK constituencies, its maximum spend would total Â£19.5m.  Â£140m2017 election cost to taxpayers Â£30,000maximum party spend per constituency 650UK constituencies Â£7,500party donations above this amount must be declared Spending can even include expenses related to attending party events. For example,62 reports of spending in McDonalds,externalwere logged with the Electoral Commission around the last election. In the 2017 general election,75 parties and 18 campaign groups reported spending more than Â£41.6m between them.,external The Conservatives spent most at Â£18.6m.It fielded 638 candidates,,externalwinning in 317 constituencies. Labour came in at Â£11m and the Liberal Democrats at Â£6.8m. Slightly less was spent on the 2015 general election at Â£39m. Campaigners who do not belong to a party have to register with the Electoral Commission if they plan to spend more than a certain amount on their campaign. That's more than Â£20,000 in England, or Â£10,000 in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The two biggest campaigns - the pro-EU Best for Britain and the National Union of Teachers - were listed as non-party campaigners in 2017's early election. Both spent more than Â£250,000. When a general election is called, there are a lot of things that need to be organised, and paid for. It is difficult to estimate how much the forthcoming election might cost. But, we do know that after former Prime Minister Theresa May called the 2017 general election,the cost to taxpayers was more than Â£140m.,external A Cabinet Office minister said that Â£98m was spent by returning officers to run the poll in their constituencies, while Â£42m went on posting material to voters. Before the 2001 general election, there were no limits on what political parties could spend on national campaigns at a UK general election. Today, if spending rules are broken, the maximum fine is Â£20,000 per offence. The Electoral Commission has called for this to be increased, and offences can include delivering late or inaccurate spending returns. The Conservative, Labour and Women's Equality parties were investigated for weekly spending reports that were inaccurate ahead of the last general election.The Conservatives received the largest fine for this at Â£6,250.,external Individuals hoping to become an MP in the House of Commons also have to keep an eye on their spending. At a local level, each candidate's spending limit is different. It is calculated by adding together a fixed amount of Â£8,700, plus either 9p or 6p per registered voter in their constituency. Successful candidates become a Member of Parliament The extra amount depends on whether it is a county constituency, or a smaller, built-up borough. Candidates have to report the costs of advertising, administration fees like telephone bills, and staff. They need to keep a log of all payments for election expenses, as well as receipts for any payments over Â£20. A really simple guide to the general election How to register to vote Do voters want a referendum or an election? More news explainers Political parties have to report information on donations to the Electoral Commission every quarter. Every donation of more than Â£7,500 which is made to a party must be declared, along with those of more than Â£1,500 made to a party's ""accounting units"". They are bits of a party whose finances are not managed by its headquarters. Donations in Great Britain can be accepted when,externalthey are made by individuals on the electoral register, most UK-based companies, trade unions or building societies. In Northern Ireland, the rules are broadly the same, except that donations can also be accepted from Irish citizens and registered organisations. Between April and the end of June this year,external, 16 parties accepted a total of Â£14.6m in donations.

Don't use NHS as political weapon - health bosses,"This video can not be played NHS Providers chief warns politicians against ""weaponising"" the health service Parties should not use the NHS as ""a political weapon"" in the election campaign, health service bosses say. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson said ""over-dramatising NHS difficulties"" or making ""disingenuous"" funding claims did the service ""no favours"". Both the Tories and Labour are vowing to spend billions to improve care. But Mr Hopson, who acts for health trust leaders in England, urged parties not to make ""empty promises"" or create ""unrealistic expectations"". The long-term future of the NHS and social care is likely to be a key battleground in the run-up to the 12 December election. The Tories are expected to trumpet extra spendingon the health service in England, including a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years and Â£100m for a further 34 hospitals to start developing future projects. This is on top of an extra Â£20bn in funding agreed by Theresa May's government up to 2023. Could the NHS be 'up for sale' to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked A really simple guide to the election,external How much does a general election cost? Labour argues the NHS is reeling from the tightest funding squeeze in modern history since 2010, which it says has left nearly four and half million people waiting for treatment and seen thousands of cancelled operations last year. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will end austerity in the NHS via a ""proper funding settlement"", with the exact details to be announced ahead of the launch of the party's manifesto. Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, mature, evidence-based"" debate on what the NHS needs. ""Let's not resort to the cheap political slogans and skimming across the top which is what we've seen over the last four or five elections,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Writing on the Times website,,externalhe said it was understandable that during election campaigns politicians should ""cast themselves as champions and defenders of the NHS"". However, he warned ""it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon"" - something he said leaders in the health service were worried was already starting to happen in this campaign. It is unrealistic to expect the parties to dial down their highly-charged debates on the subject. But NHS Providers argues that already things are getting out of hand with signs that the NHS is being ""weaponised"". Underlying all this is a warning that the NHS in England cannot seem to keep up with growing demand for care, which is ""particularly worrying"" with winter looming. Hospital chiefs are known to be concerned that there was intense pressure in recent weeks before winter had really set in. How that pressure develops before polling day could be a major issue in this campaign. While there were areas where ""the NHS is falling short"", he said ""over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients"". And Carrie MacEwen, from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said undeliverable promises ""simply set up the NHS to fail"". ""The NHS's role is to manage the health of the nation, not to be used as a tool to swing voters in a three-way marginal,"" she told the Times. ""Our fear is in these febrile times we will see irrational, undeliverable promises or even outright lies."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agreed that the NHS ""shouldn't be weaponised"" during the election campaign but voters deserved an ""honest debate about it."" Speaking after a visit to Unison headquarters to meet NHS staff, he also repeated that under a Labour government, the health service would be ""brought back in house"" when privatised contracts ""come to an end"". Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliament Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The Tories have repudiated Labour claims that privatisation has exploded in recent years, pointing to figures showing the total number of private contracts has remained static at 7% in the past four years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock accused Labour of peddling ""scare stories"" to try and win votes because they have ""nothing positive to offer"". ""These stories worry some of the most vulnerable people in the country, who the Labour Party used to say they represented,"" he said in a video message on Twitter. ""It is only with the Conservatives, with our strong support for the economy, that we can make sure the health service is always there for you and your family."" But former Conservative health secretary Stephen Dorrell, who is standing as a Lib Dem candidate in the election, said both the main parties were driven by ideology when it came to the issue. The NHS, he told the BBC Radio 4's World at One, was a ""perfect example of a place where our economy works best when the public and private work together"".

HK bakers accuse competition of cake 'censorship',"The Guy Fawkes mask has been worn by many protesters during anti government rallies A Hong Kong protest-themed cake has been disqualified from a cake decorating competition in the UK, in a move that has been referred to as ""political censorship"". It featured protest symbols including umbrellas and a Guy Fawkes mask. The company behind the cake told the BBC it believed it was pulled after complaints from Chinese competitors. But the Birmingham competition organisers said it was because one element of the cake was oversized. Anti-government protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for five months. They first erupted in June, triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The bill has been withdrawn but the protests have continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. The cake was one of many displayed this year at the Cake International competition, held in the city of Birmingham from 1- 3 November. It draws competitors from all over the world. The entry by a baker from the 3rd Space cafe in Hong Kong included fake tear gas and a figure made to look like a typical protester clad in black and wearing a hard hat. A man in a yellow hard hat, carrying an umbrella, was one element of the cake The cake also had umbrellas which had fake ""tear gas"" coming out of them It was inspired by the ""streets [of] Hong Kong"", the spokesperson for the cafe told the BBC. ""The design was simply an expression of what is happening at the moment in Hong Kong,"" the spokesperson added. A music box placed inside the cake also played ""Glory to Hong Kong""- a tune which has been adopted as the unofficial anthem of the protests - on loop. Glory to Hong Kong: The city's new protest song The Hong Kong protesters singing Hallelujah But according to 3rd Space, Cake International decided to take action after it received numerous ""complaints from Chinese candidates"", who said the cake featured ""offensive content... promoting [the] independence of Hong Kong"". Cake International first decided to turn the music off, before later sending the baker an email telling them that the cake would be ""removed"", said 3rd space. Dozens of people later took to Cake International's social media platforms complaining, accusing the organisers of pandering to ""censorship"". Allow Twitter content?

""Oversized exhibits will be disqualified. This entry was not removed as a political statement,"" it said in a Facebook post. However, 3rd space said: ""It is obvious that it was an excuse that they came up [with] to cover their political censorship."" The company said it goes against the principle the competition is meant to uphold to provide an inclusive platform.

"Veteran Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne dies aged 85RTÃ director general, Dee Forbes, says Mr Byrne was a household name in Ireland for many years.Europe","Renowned Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne has died at the age of 85. A broadcasting giant in the Republic of Ireland, he hosted the Late Late Show for more than 30 years on the country's national broadcaster RTÃ. Major figures from entertainment and politics paid tribute to him after his death on Monday after a long illness. Irish President Michael D Higgins said Byrne was a ""man of great charisma"", had compassion in abundance and a ""sense of what was just"". Late Late Show reels back the years RTÃ's director general Dee Forbes described him as an exceptional broadcaster with a ""unique and groundbreaking style"". ""He not only defined generations but he deftly arbitrated the growth and development of a nation,"" she said. This video can not be played When Gay Byrne met Boyzone ""Ireland grew up under Gay Byrne and we will never see his like again."" His wife Kathleen and their daughters Crona and Suzy said he died at home surrounded by his family. ""We wish to thank everybody for their love and support during Gay's illness, particularly the wonderful teams in the Mater Hospital, St Francis Hospice and the Irish Cancer Society,"" they said. Gay Byrne interviewed Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams on the Late Late Show in 1994 Gay Byrne, or Gaybo as he was almost universally known, was the leading Irish broadcaster of his era. As anchor of the Late Late Show, he steered the audience through the highs and lows of Irish life. From Ballybunion to Buncrana, he was a familiar and controversial face on Irish screens every Friday night, presiding over the shifting moods of the country. Read more:The leading Irish broadcaster of his era Byrne hosted the Late Late Show - which combined light entertainment and current affairs - in a relaxed but intelligent manner. The show embraced discussion about divorce, abortion and sexuality, which were regarded as controversial subjects in Ireland at the time. It made headlines with highlights such as a 1993 interview with Annie Murphy, who had a child with the former Bishop of Galway Eamon Casey. Byrne's wife Kathleen Watkins - pictured with him in 2015 - said he died surrounded by his family In 1992, the then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke fell foul of the show when he was coaxed into singing Oh My Darling Clementine on a day when seven Protestant workmen were killed in an IRA bomb. Byrne also fronted a long-running radio show that was first known as the Gay Byrne Hour and later the Gay Byrne Show. He also presented the Rose of Tralee pageant, the Housewife of the Year competition and a range of special programmes. Singer Sinead O'Connor appeared on Byrne's final Late Late Show in 1999 He presented his final daily radio show in 1998 and his last Late Late Show the following summer. Early in his career he also worked for Granada Television and the BBC. President Higgins said Mr Byrne's work ""shone a light not only on the bright but also the dark sides of Irish life"". ""[He helped] shape our conscience, our self-image and our idea of who we might be,"" added the president. Some of Byrne's fellow broadcasters took to social media to pay tribute to him. Graham Norton, the Irish presenter who hosts TV and radio shows for the BBC, said Byrne ""showed us all how it should be done"". Allow Twitter content?

Mothercare memories and what went wrong,"Frankie Brunker's children Ayla and Jago still use the Little Bird lamp that was bought for their sister As Mothercare announces the closure of all 79 of its UK stores, parents share their memories of the baby brand. It was once the one-stop shop for all things baby-related, butMothercare has been loss-making for yearsand now 2,500 jobs are at risk. Frankie Brunker, from Hertfordshire, said the brand held poignant memories for her after she bought a Little Bird bedside lamp and cot bedding during her first pregnancy in 2013. Frankie Brunker said she made meaningful connections with Mothercare ranges ""Sadly we never got to use it for our daughter as she was stillborn at full term a couple of months later,"" she said. ""We'd barely bought anything for her as we were fortunate to have so many hand-me-downs from relatives, so those purchases became even more meaningful as items that were connected just to her. ""I would sit in her beautifully-decorated nursery with her little light on when I was pregnant with her little brother, hoping against hope that he would arrive safely. ""Thankfully he did in October 2014, and we were able to welcome another little girl into our family in March 2017."" Frankie Brunker said she loved Mothercare's Little Bird clothing range The family still use the lamp, while the brightly-coloured Little Bird clothing range became their favourite, she said. ""It was not only because of the association withrainbow babiesborn, the name given to babies born after a loss, but just because we loved the colourful gender-neutral designs,"" she said. ""It will be a huge shame if Little Bird goes along with Mothercare."" Aisa Kara said Mothercare's online offering was not as strong as competitors Aisa Kara's parenting journey started in Mothercare when she used its Babybond ultrasound scanning service. She has fond memories of having her early pregnancy scan in the store on Nottingham's Castle Marina Retail Park. ""I was so anxious waiting for my 12-week scan, and I don't think either of us could believe it was actually happening, so we booked our private appointment,"" she said. ""Everything was OK and we viewed a heartbeat, so we left elated, and as it was in Mothercare we got to buy our first item of baby clothing at the same time. That's when it dawned on us that it was all real."" Aisa Kara dressed her children Arabella and Theo almost exclusively in Mothercare clothes Ms Kara, who is mother to Arabella, aged five, and Theo, two, said: ""We bought all our nursery items and pushchair from there, and my daughter and son have been dressed in Mothercare almost exclusively. ""My only complaint is that the online experience isn't as good as you would have expected from a company trying to keep up with the market."" Shona Parker, from Carterton, Oxfordshire, posted a picture of a baby name book from Mothercare. ""My own mum used it to name a couple of my siblings; I now have a baby of my own and drew inspiration from it,"" she said. Amena Khan said Mothercare could have created better social media campaigns Amena Khan is disappointed to see Mothercare go as it was her ""first port of call"" for essentials for son Ibraheem, 10 and daughter Aleena, eight. ""It was a no-brainer - if we needed something for the babies or for me as a new mum, we'd pop into Mothercare,"" the entrepreneur and influencer from Leicester said. ""The physical experience of being able to compare products and ask the sales assistants questions couldn't be beaten."" But Mrs Khan said the brand could have gone further to enhance customer experience. ""Mothercare could've easily created social media campaigns to amplify the voices of diverse mothers and fathers in today's society,"" she said. Lydia Robinson, 28, from Dudley, West Midlands, said she ""couldn't live"" without Mothercare. ""I've used Mothercare from the moment I found out I was pregnant in March 2018,"" she said. ""I have bought his pushchair, high chair, Moses basket, clothing, walker and all bathing and feeding items from the store. ""I couldn't imagine buying anything so essential and important over the internet and not seeing it in the flesh beforehand. ""Mothercare staff are always so knowledgeable and helpful, they make you feel at ease and never pressure you in to buying anything unnecessary. ""It's a unique High Street store with everything you need throughout pregnancy and once your baby has arrived - there's nowhere else like it. Losing a store like this would be a massive loss."" Shona Parker drew inspiration for her baby's name from this Mothercare book Justine Roberts, Mumsnet founder, said users were saddened to hear about potential job losses at Mothercare and the demise of a high street ""legend"". ""That said, lots of users report being sometimes frustrated by low levels of stock, cluttered stores with variable service and high prices,"" she said. ""But many are deeply invested in the brand and its long years of service to UK families and very much wish to see it stay on its feet."" Mothercare UK administration plan threatens 2,500 jobs Why the UK's shops are closing down High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost Mumsnet users have beenswapping stories,externalabout shopping in Mothercare to prepare for the arrival of babies who are now adults. One user talks about accompanying her pregnant daughter to the same local store that had provided baby clothes for the now-expectant young mother. Another has a specific memory of Mothercare's ""blissful"" breastfeeding rooms, adding: ""Wall-to-wall breasts, and more latching-on advice from strangers than was decent.""

McDonald's boss fired after dating employee,"McDonald's has fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he had a relationship with an employee. The US fast food giant said the relationship was consensual, but Mr Easterbrook had ""violated company policy"" and shown ""poor judgement"". The British businessman, who earned nearly $16m (Â£12.3m) last year, is due to receive 26 weeks of pay. The full value of the deal was not clear. He is also eligible for a bonus, if the firm hits its performance goals. Bloomberg estimated that he will leave with more than $37m, the bulk of which includes previously granted shares. In exchange, Mr Easterbrook has agreed not to work for a competitor for at least two years. Easterbrook's new McJob Intel chief resigns over relationship The Bottom Line: Managing Workplace Relationships In an email to staff, Mr Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake. ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" he said. The company's top human resources officer has also left the company, McDonald's said. Mr Easterbrook, 52, who is divorced, first worked for McDonald's in 1993 as a manager in London before working his way up the company. He left in 2011 to become boss of Pizza Express and then Asian food chain Wagamama, before returning to McDonald's in 2013, eventually becoming its head in the UK and northern Europe. This video can not be played 'Fine line between consensual and inappropriate relationships' He was appointed chief executive of McDonald's in 2015. Mr Easterbrook is widely credited with revitalising the firm's menus and restaurants, by remodelling stores and using better ingredients. The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US. Under his leadership, McDonald's also expanded its delivery and mobile payment options to emphasise convenience. The fast food giant's board voted on Watford-born Mr Easterbrook's departure on Friday after a review. He has also stepped down as McDonald's president and member of the board. McDonald's said it has longstanding rules against conflicts of interest. It declined to provide further information about the person with whom Mr Easterbrook had the relationship, including whether the person was a direct report or remained employed by the company. Employment lawyer Ruby Dinsmore, of Slater and Gordon, said it is now common for firms to have either outright bans on relationships, or to have notification clauses requiring individuals to disclose them. Potential conflicts of interest or litigation if a relationship turns sour were becoming a real risk for companies, she told the BBC. ""Some people may view this an an invasion of privacy,"" she said. ""But businesses have their own interests to protect as well."" In the era of MeToo ""companies are very keen to be seem not only to have a policy for this type of situation, but also to be seen to be enforcing it at all levels,"" she said. The company has been criticised over the amount it pays shop staff, and Mr Easterbrook faced scrutiny for his $15.9m pay packet in 2018, which included a roughly $1.3m base salary, as well as benefits and bonus. It was 2,124 times the median employee salary of $7,473. He will be replaced by Chris Kempczinski, most recently president of McDonald's USA, with immediate effect. In a statement, Mr Kempczinski thanked Mr Easterbrook for his contributions, adding: ""Steve brought me into McDonald's and he was a patient and helpful mentor."" Last year Intel boss Brian Krzanich stepped down for having a consensual relationship with an Intel employee, which was against company rules. He had been in the post since May 2013.

UK terror threat downgraded to 'substantial',"""Substantial"" is the third out of five possible ratings for the country's level of terror threat The UK's terrorism threat level has been downgraded from ""severe"" to ""substantial"", the Home Office says. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at ""a high level of threat"" and an attack could ""occur without further warning"". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains ""severe"". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a ""direct and immediate"" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government.

Right-wing extremism to inform terror threat level Reality Check: How terrorism threat levels work ""Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms,"" Ms Patel said.

Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been ""positive developments"" in the fight against terrorism but it was ""vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance"". He saidthe UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations,external- while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of ""subjects of interest"" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are ""lone actors"" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. TheUK's terrorism threat level,externalwas raised to the highest rating, ""critical"", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, ""severe"", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC,externalare: Low - an attack is highly unlikely Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely Substantial - an attack is likely Severe - an attack is highly likely Critical - an attack is highly likely in the near future Right-wing extremism to inform terror threat level UK terror threat: How has it changed?

Jury sworn in for backpacker murder trial,"Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A jury has been sworn in for the trial of a man accused of murdering a British backpacker. Grace Millane, 22, was last seen in central Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 December last year, before her body was found in bushland a week later. A 27-year-old local man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has denied her murder. The Auckland High Court trial is scheduled to last up to five weeks. Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. She had been travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following a six-week group trip through South America. The family of Miss Millane, from Wickford, Essex, became concerned for the University of Lincoln graduate after she failed to respond to birthday messages on 2 December.

Vietnamese police make eight lorry death arrests,"Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims Eight suspects have been held in Vietnam after 39 people were found dead in a lorry in Essex. The arrests came as a team of Vietnamese officials arrived in Britain to help formally identify the 31 men and eight women. The suspects are being held in relation to people smuggling offences, the director of police in the Nghe An province in north-central Vietnam said. Two people were arrested in the Ha Tinh province of Vietnam last week. The victims were discovered in a refrigerated lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays on 23 October. On Friday, Essex Police said all 39 people were believed to be Vietnamese. The force initially said it believed they were Chinese. A service was held for the victims in east London on Saturday evening Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese Government. A spokeswoman for the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the incident a ""serious humanitarian tragedy"". Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the victims to establish the cause of their deaths. More than 100 people attended a service for the victims at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening. Essex lorry deaths should be 'wake-up call' Services for Vietnamese lorry death victims Essex lorry deaths: What we know The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court last week charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

MPs to elect next Commons Speaker,"This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House MPs are voting between the final two candidates to succeed John Bercow as Speaker, in what is the first election for the post in more than a decade. In the third round of voting Sir Lindsay Hoyle received the most votes at 267, followed by Chris Bryant with 169 and Dame Eleanor Laing was eliminated with 127. The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. The result of the final ballot is expected about 20:00 GMT. Seven candidates were originally in the running. Having received the least number of votes, Dame Rosie Winterton had to leave the contest in the second round of voting and Harriet Harman voluntarily withdrew her candidacy. Labour MP Meg Hillier and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh were knocked out in the first round of the contest after receiving 10 and 11 votes respectively. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. LIVE: Speaker contest under way Ken Clarke is leading the proceedings The first to speak was Labour's Dame Rosie Winterton. She said the Speaker's job was ""not to dominate proceedings or speak for Parliament"", and promised to ""douse the flames not pour petrol on them"". Another Labour MP Chris Bryant said he believed in ""a Speaker who will stand by the rules, who is completely impartial and who knows Erskine May [the parliamentary rule book] back to front"", adding: ""I've got it lying by my bedside."" He also pledged to end clapping in the chamber and ""sort out the wi-fi"" - pledges that were themselves met with clapping from those listening. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker How MPs will choose the next Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said a Speaker should ""submerge their character in the job"" and be ""a quiet voice"". He also said the preservation of parliamentary buildings should be done ""in the interests of our paymaster - the taxpayers"". ""We cannot waste billions of pounds,"" he said. Current deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing expressed sadness at the number of MPs deciding not to run again at the December election and vowed to stand up for all members if selected for the job. She said Parliament needed to ""escape from the hierarchical structures that allow bullying to take root"". Also addressing the subject of bullying, Labour's Meg Hillier said MPs needed to protect staff in the House, warning bullying ""will become the next expenses scandal"". Mr Bercow was criticised for not doing more to tackle allegations of bullying and harassment in the Commons, and was himself accused of mistreating several members of staff, which he denied. Chris Bryant admitted to keeping a book on parliamentary procedure by his bedside Another current deputy Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said he had introduced security measures for MPs ""so we can feel safe"". ""I will not let you down,"" he promised MPs. Former deputy leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman was last to make her pitch, promising to take on a fourth deputy drawn from one of the smaller parties. She said she had ""an unparallel record of reform"", pointing to her campaign to allow pregnant MPs and new parents to vote by proxy. The candidates made their pitches under the gaze of former Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Labour MP Stella Creasy got a picture of the baroness sitting in the gallery Allow Instagram content?

Candidates needed the support of at least 12 MPs, three of whom have to be from a different party, in order to be eligible to take part. MPs have 20 minutes to vote in a secret ballot. It will take about 45 minutes to count them. If no candidate receives more half of the votes, the individual who receives the least votes will drop out, as will anyone who obtains less than 5% of the total cast. After each round, there will be a 10-minute period for candidates to withdraw. MPs will then continue to vote until one candidate obtains more than half of the votes. The process is being overseen by Ken Clarke, who as Father of the House is the long-serving MP in the Commons. Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle is regarded as the frontrunner for the role Labour's Harriet Harman has said she wants to put an end to ""the Old Boys' Club"" in Parliament Dame Eleanor Laing has said she would ""do things differently"" from Mr Bercow The seven contenders at the start of the race were: Chris Bryant- former minister and shadow Commons leader; Labour MP for Rhondda since 2001 Harriet Harman- former minister and deputy Labour leader; Labour MP since 1982, for Peckham and its successor constituency Camberwell Meg Hillier- chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and former minister; Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 Sir Lindsay Hoyle- elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2010 Dame Eleanor Laing- elected Conservative MP for Epping Forest in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2013 Sir Edward Leigh- Conservative MP for Gainsborough since 1983; former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Dame Rosie Winterton- elected Labour MP for Doncaster Central in 1997; former Labour chief whip; elected deputy Speaker in 2017 BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said most observers believed Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - was the frontrunner. ""As Chairman of Ways and Means, he chairs Budget debates and selects amendments for committee stage proceedings on bills, and has had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his credentials,"" our correspondent says. Sir Lindsay said MPs backing him included Conservative Charles Walker, who was one of Mr Bercow's key allies during his tenure, former sports minister Tracey Crouch and Brexit-backing Labour MP Caroline Flint.

The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked. By Mark D'Arcy, the BBC's parliamentary correspondent So what might MPs want in a new Speaker? First, there seems be an appetite for a different style - an end to Bercow-esque grandiloquence and those five-minute appeals for brevity, as well as for an end to the kind of clashes with MPs that the departed Speaker was prone to. Remember his red-faced finger-jabbing clash with the then Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, or this week's spat with long-time Bercow critic Andrew Bridgen? Then there's the much more important concern about the Speaker's sweeping powers to make the rules in the Commons, a power which saw him permitting amendments to Business of the House motions which were supposed to be taken ""forthwith"" - which many MPs believed meant they could not be amended. Given no one party has a majority in the House, the winning candidate will be the one most capable of reaching across party lines, and building a majority out of factions of the main parties, the members of the smaller parties and their personal supporters. Those seen as party gladiators first and foremost may find that hard to do.

Tory candidate apologises for Facebook post,"Francesca O'Brien admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"" A Conservative general election candidate has apologised for a Facebook post in which she said people on a TV show needed ""putting down"". Francesca O'Brien, who is running for the Gower seat in December's election, made the comments about Channel 4's Benefits Street in January 2014. Ms O'Brien said her comments were made ""off the cuff"" but admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"". Labour and the Lib Dems called for the candidate to be dropped. But Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies has stood by Ms O'Brien, who is still set to run in the general election on 12 December. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine voters in Gower backing such a candidate, while a Tory peer has said the candidate should consider her position. The former commissioned officer with the RAF Air Cadets was selected to be the Conservative party candidate for Gower in October after an open primary in which residents were able to participate as opposed to just party members. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election Having lost Gower to Labour in the 2017 election, the seat is a top Tory target in Wales. In the posts following the broadcast of the first episode of Benefits Street five years ago, Ms O'Brien said: ""Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!"" Responding to another user's comment, she said: ""My blood is boiling, these people need putting down."" The Conservatives won Gower - which Labour held for more than 100 years - in 2015, but lost it in the 2017 snap election In a statement released on Sunday, Ms O'Brien said: ""These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. ""However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the Today programme what Ms O'Brien said was ""clearly wrong"", adding it was important she had apologised. Asked if Ms O'Brien should stand, she said: ""I think that would be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next Member of Parliament."" But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine ""decent people"" in the constituency backing a candidate with ""views of that sort"". ""I think she is condemned out of her own mouth more eloquently than anything I could say,"" Mr Drakeford told his monthly press conference. Ian Lavery, Labour Party chairman, said: ""Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer.Â ""The cuts to benefits and Universal Credit programme that Therese Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty."" He said Ms O'Brien's candidacy was ""shameful"". Speaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said he thought Ms O'Brien's comments were ""awful"". ""I'm sure she does too,"" he added. ""I do think she should consider her position."" Byron Davies said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process The chairman of the Welsh Conservatives said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process. Lord Davies - a former MP for the constituency - said: ""The comments were inadvisable, obviously, but made in the heat of the moment watching a television programme. ""But I don't condone it in any shape or form. However, this is a dredging exercise on the part of the Labour Party whose candidate in the Gower doesn't want to talk about Brexit."" Benefits Street, which featured the residents of James Turner Street in Birmingham, was a ratings hit for Channel 4 when it was broadcast. But a total of 887 viewers complained to the broadcasting regulator, claiming the show had vilified and misrepresented benefits claimants. Ofcom decided the programmedid not breach broadcastingrules. Ms O'Brien is due to stand against Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi, Plaid Cymru's John Davies and Sam Bennett of the Liberal Democrats. Other parties are yet to confirm their candidates. Mr Davies invited Ms O'Brien to join him on a soup run ""to see how real people have been affected by Tory cuts to public housing"". Lib Dem Mr Bennett called for her to step down, adding: ""These kind of comments show the Tories are still very much the nasty party.""

Judges lash officials over deadly Delhi smog,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey shows what it's like driving through the high levels of smog in Delhi India's top court has accused state governments of ""passing the buck"" on air pollution and failing to take action to tackle Delhi's toxic smog. The Supreme Court said authorities were only interested in ""gimmicks"", rather than concrete measures to combat pollution levels. Levels of dangerous particles in the air - known as PM2.5 - are at well over 10 times safe limits in the capital. City authorities have responded by launching a car rationing system. The fight against air pollution in three global cities ""Delhi is choking every year and we are unable to do anything,"" said Supreme Court Justice Arun Mishra. ""The state machinery is not actingâ¦ They are passing the buck to each other... Everybody is interested in gimmicks and elections."" From 4 to 15 November, cars with odd or even number plates will only be allowed on the roads on alternate days, officials said. Such a system has been used before but it is not clear if it helps lower pollution levels. This video can not be played 'It's making us sick but we have nowhere to go': Delhi's homeless sleep in the smog Cars are not believed to be the main cause of Delhi's toxic air, with experts pointing instead to crop burning by farmers in neighbouring states to clear fields. Health officials have asked people to stay indoors and refrain from doing any physical activity as millions are at risk of respiratory illness. Schools are closed until Tuesday and the shutdown is likely to be extended until Friday as the city chokes under a thick blanket of smog. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the car rationing system, known as the ""odd-even plan"", would take hundreds of thousands of cars off the road. Those ignoring the rule face a fine of 4,000 rupees (Â£44; $56) - double that of previous years. by Krutika Pathi, BBC News, Delhi Teary eyes, a throat like sandpaper, and a hacking cough that left me breathless - these were the side effects after I went for a walk around my neighbourhood in Delhi. Whenever ""pollution season"" starts to set in, I notice the changes in my body rather quickly. I've lost count of the number of times I've woken up with a severe cough during the winter season. From your nose to your chest, it feels like things aren't working the way they should be. On some days, it's just a blocked nose and on others, it's almost a struggle to breathe normally. The effects go beyond the physical too. I'm constantly thinking about Air Quality Index numbers and whether the air is breathable - I even activate my air purifier via an app as I leave work so that my room has clean air by the time I'm home. ""The perfect storm of conditions during November has created almost 30% higher atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter,"" said a Cornell University study published in July. Delhi's geography - it is landlocked and sits on a flat plain that is blocked off by the Himalayas - means it is more drastically affected. Only public transport, emergency vehicles, taxis and two-wheelers will be allowed. Women driving alone will also be exempt from the rule. The Supreme Court has ordered Delhi's state government to produce data which proves that the car rationing system works. Experts say emissions from vehicles are just one of several factors that have turned the city into - in Mr Kejriwal's words - a ""gas chamber"". A major cause of the high pollution levels at this time of year is farmers in neighbouring states burning crop stubble to clear their fields. This creates a lethal cocktail of particulate matter and gases - carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide - all worsened by fireworks set off during the Hindu festival of Diwali a week ago. Construction and industrial emissions have also contributed to the smog. How a food crisis led to Delhi's foul smog Millions of masks given out in 'gas chamber' Delhi Delhi's foul air came from India's farming revolution How do Ultra Low Emissions Zones work? Efforts to identify a cause have sparked a row between state and federal politicians, with Mr Kejriwal calling on the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana to crack down on crop burning. Federal Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar accused Mr Kejriwal of politicising the issue and painting his neighbours as ""villains"". The Supreme Court also summoned the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states to appear before it to answer questions about efforts to tackle stubble burning. The level of PM2.5 - tiny particulates that can enter deep into the lungs - was at one point seven times higher than in the Chinese capital Beijing, which has battled similar pollution problems in recent years. Five million masks were handed out in schoolson Friday as officials declared a public health emergency. Part of the reason is a change in crop cycles and harvesting in the agricultural states of Punjab and Haryana. A decade ago the two states passed identical laws intended to preserve ground water, which effectively compelled farmers to plant their rice crops in mid-June rather than at the end of April, as was the tradition. This was to enable them to make use of monsoonal rains to grow the heavily water-dependent crop. A traffic policeman wears a mask to protect himself at a busy junction The delay in the planting cycle meant the harvesting cycle was also delayed. Farmers now have much less time to prepare their fields for the next crop cycle and burning stubble is a cheap and effective way to clear the land. Unfortunately, this coincides with changing wind patterns over Delhi and the rest of north India. India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has recommended some guidelines for residents of Delhi to cope with the elevated smog levels. They include avoiding strenuous activities and hard labour if possible, and exercising indoors. When outdoors, avoiding main roads and congested areas can help, as smaller roads and bylanes tend to be less polluted. Wearing a mask can help filter out pollutants, but simple surgical masks or comfort masks will not. A smog mask with a respirator is recommended. Do not burn rubbish or other discarded items outdoors, and try to avoid or share car trips to reduce the number of cars on the road. Are you in Delhi?

Hundreds of London minicabs 'working illegally',"This video can not be played Gerti Qamili was challenged after the secret filming Hundreds of London minicab drivers may be working fraudulently after buying qualifications, the BBC has found. Drivers must sit mandatory exams to get a licence. But a BBC undercover investigation has exposed colleges cheating the required tests. Transport for London (TfL) said it would immediately investigate at least 1,667 applications in light of the evidence. TfL, the licensing authority, said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the findings. The growth in taxi booking firms such as Uber have seen the number of private hire vehicle licences in use that were issued in the capital surge by 86% between 2011 and 2018, from 61,200 to 113,645. Under the cab application process, along with a criminal record check and medical test, drivers must sit a topographical exam and an English test at one of eight official TfL testing centres. Evidence of these exams can also be accepted via other qualifications including BTecs, which are usually taken at private colleges and centres. The qualification can be used to gain a minicab licence from many councils across the UK. One of these colleges, Vista Training Solutions in Newham, east London, offered to take the tests for several BBC researchers for Â£500 per BTec. Secret recordings show manager Gerti Qamili accepting money to cheat exams At a mandatory English and maths assessment answers were read out to eight candidates taking the BTec fraudulently. Registers were falsified before the online BTec exam was taken by the managers on the candidates' behalf. The researcher, who had neither attended any classes nor completed an exam, received a BTec level two certificate in Introduction to the Role of the Professional Taxi and Private Hire Driver. Another undercover BBC researcher, who had also done nothing other than pay, subsequently received a certificate stating he had passed his BTec level two. Vista was one of the several centres the BBC heard was facilitating fraudulently obtained qualifications. During undercover filming Gerti Qamili, a college manager, bragged he had helped ""over 300 students"" fraudulently achieve the qualification. The scam had been successfully winning licences from TfL for more than two years, Mr Qamili said. He warned the researchers ""not to tell anyone that someone does the test for you"". Vista Training Solutions has received more than Â£1.5m since 2018 for apprenticeships. Ofsted singled out the college for ""ensuring that the training meets the needs of the industry"" ina monitoring report,externalin December last year. Abdalla Jamac was filmed handing out answers to a test during undercover filming at Vista Training Solutions Caroline Pidgeon, deputy chair of London's Transport Committee, said: ""Passengers are getting into those vehicles, and they need to know they're safe. ""To hear parts of that (qualifications) are being forged around London, that's not right, that's really worrying and TfL need to get a grip on this."" Helen Chapman, a director at TfL, said: ""It is deeply concerning to learn that some colleges or schools could be illegally providing certificates. ""We will support the relevant authorities with any wider investigations into these organisations. We will take immediate action against any driver identified as fraudulently obtaining a licence."" Uber's London licence renewed for two months Taxi licences for convicted criminals Why is my taxi from another city? TfL said all new applications in which the topographical test had been taken at a private college rather than at one of its eight official examination centres had now been put on hold. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan whose office oversees TfL said: ""This was a very serious breach."" He added that TfL would be working with the police to investigate any rules that had been broken. ""The reason why it's so serious is because we know that in the past there have been examples of serious criminal offences committed,"" he added. Vista Training Solutions said it was shocked by the allegations, which it said would be a violation of its policies, as well as a crime. It added it would be launching its own internal investigation. Mr Qamili and Abdalla Jamac, who the company claimed were responsible for the BTec level two taxi course, are no longer working at Vista. Both were contacted by the BBC but refused to comment. This story will be featured on BBC London TV News and Inside Out on BBC One in London on Monday 4 November at 19:30 GMT and afterwards on the iPlayer.

"McDonald's boss fired after dating employeeSteve Easterbrook had a consensual relationship with another member of staff, violating company rules.Business","McDonald's has fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he had a relationship with an employee. The US fast food giant said the relationship was consensual, but Mr Easterbrook had ""violated company policy"" and shown ""poor judgement"". The British businessman, who earned nearly $16m (Â£12.3m) last year, is due to receive 26 weeks of pay. The full value of the deal was not clear. He is also eligible for a bonus, if the firm hits its performance goals. Bloomberg estimated that he will leave with more than $37m, the bulk of which includes previously granted shares. In exchange, Mr Easterbrook has agreed not to work for a competitor for at least two years. Easterbrook's new McJob Intel chief resigns over relationship The Bottom Line: Managing Workplace Relationships In an email to staff, Mr Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake. ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" he said. The company's top human resources officer has also left the company, McDonald's said. Mr Easterbrook, 52, who is divorced, first worked for McDonald's in 1993 as a manager in London before working his way up the company. He left in 2011 to become boss of Pizza Express and then Asian food chain Wagamama, before returning to McDonald's in 2013, eventually becoming its head in the UK and northern Europe. This video can not be played 'Fine line between consensual and inappropriate relationships' He was appointed chief executive of McDonald's in 2015. Mr Easterbrook is widely credited with revitalising the firm's menus and restaurants, by remodelling stores and using better ingredients. The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US. Under his leadership, McDonald's also expanded its delivery and mobile payment options to emphasise convenience. The fast food giant's board voted on Watford-born Mr Easterbrook's departure on Friday after a review. He has also stepped down as McDonald's president and member of the board. McDonald's said it has longstanding rules against conflicts of interest. It declined to provide further information about the person with whom Mr Easterbrook had the relationship, including whether the person was a direct report or remained employed by the company. Employment lawyer Ruby Dinsmore, of Slater and Gordon, said it is now common for firms to have either outright bans on relationships, or to have notification clauses requiring individuals to disclose them. Potential conflicts of interest or litigation if a relationship turns sour were becoming a real risk for companies, she told the BBC. ""Some people may view this an an invasion of privacy,"" she said. ""But businesses have their own interests to protect as well."" In the era of MeToo ""companies are very keen to be seem not only to have a policy for this type of situation, but also to be seen to be enforcing it at all levels,"" she said. The company has been criticised over the amount it pays shop staff, and Mr Easterbrook faced scrutiny for his $15.9m pay packet in 2018, which included a roughly $1.3m base salary, as well as benefits and bonus. It was 2,124 times the median employee salary of $7,473. He will be replaced by Chris Kempczinski, most recently president of McDonald's USA, with immediate effect. In a statement, Mr Kempczinski thanked Mr Easterbrook for his contributions, adding: ""Steve brought me into McDonald's and he was a patient and helpful mentor."" Last year Intel boss Brian Krzanich stepped down for having a consensual relationship with an Intel employee, which was against company rules. He had been in the post since May 2013.

"Tory candidate apologises for Facebook postFrancesca O'Brien apologises for saying people on the programme Benefits Street ""need putting down"".Wales politics","Francesca O'Brien admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"" A Conservative general election candidate has apologised for a Facebook post in which she said people on a TV show needed ""putting down"". Francesca O'Brien, who is running for the Gower seat in December's election, made the comments about Channel 4's Benefits Street in January 2014. Ms O'Brien said her comments were made ""off the cuff"" but admitted her ""use of language was unacceptable"". Labour and the Lib Dems called for the candidate to be dropped. But Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies has stood by Ms O'Brien, who is still set to run in the general election on 12 December. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine voters in Gower backing such a candidate, while a Tory peer has said the candidate should consider her position. The former commissioned officer with the RAF Air Cadets was selected to be the Conservative party candidate for Gower in October after an open primary in which residents were able to participate as opposed to just party members. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election Having lost Gower to Labour in the 2017 election, the seat is a top Tory target in Wales. In the posts following the broadcast of the first episode of Benefits Street five years ago, Ms O'Brien said: ""Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!"" Responding to another user's comment, she said: ""My blood is boiling, these people need putting down."" The Conservatives won Gower - which Labour held for more than 100 years - in 2015, but lost it in the 2017 snap election In a statement released on Sunday, Ms O'Brien said: ""These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. ""However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told the Today programme what Ms O'Brien said was ""clearly wrong"", adding it was important she had apologised. Asked if Ms O'Brien should stand, she said: ""I think that would be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next Member of Parliament."" But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said he could not imagine ""decent people"" in the constituency backing a candidate with ""views of that sort"". ""I think she is condemned out of her own mouth more eloquently than anything I could say,"" Mr Drakeford told his monthly press conference. Ian Lavery, Labour Party chairman, said: ""Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer.Â ""The cuts to benefits and Universal Credit programme that Therese Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty."" He said Ms O'Brien's candidacy was ""shameful"". Speaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein said he thought Ms O'Brien's comments were ""awful"". ""I'm sure she does too,"" he added. ""I do think she should consider her position."" Byron Davies said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process The chairman of the Welsh Conservatives said Ms O'Brien was not subject to any internal disciplinary process. Lord Davies - a former MP for the constituency - said: ""The comments were inadvisable, obviously, but made in the heat of the moment watching a television programme. ""But I don't condone it in any shape or form. However, this is a dredging exercise on the part of the Labour Party whose candidate in the Gower doesn't want to talk about Brexit."" Benefits Street, which featured the residents of James Turner Street in Birmingham, was a ratings hit for Channel 4 when it was broadcast. But a total of 887 viewers complained to the broadcasting regulator, claiming the show had vilified and misrepresented benefits claimants. Ofcom decided the programmedid not breach broadcastingrules. Ms O'Brien is due to stand against Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi, Plaid Cymru's John Davies and Sam Bennett of the Liberal Democrats. Other parties are yet to confirm their candidates. Mr Davies invited Ms O'Brien to join him on a soup run ""to see how real people have been affected by Tory cuts to public housing"". Lib Dem Mr Bennett called for her to step down, adding: ""These kind of comments show the Tories are still very much the nasty party.""

"Don't use NHS as political weapon - health bossesPoliticians are urged not to make ""empty promises"" and tell ""outright lies"" about health funding.","This video can not be played NHS Providers chief warns politicians against ""weaponising"" the health service Parties should not use the NHS as ""a political weapon"" in the election campaign, health service bosses say. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson said ""over-dramatising NHS difficulties"" or making ""disingenuous"" funding claims did the service ""no favours"". Both the Tories and Labour are vowing to spend billions to improve care. But Mr Hopson, who acts for health trust leaders in England, urged parties not to make ""empty promises"" or create ""unrealistic expectations"". The long-term future of the NHS and social care is likely to be a key battleground in the run-up to the 12 December election. The Tories are expected to trumpet extra spendingon the health service in England, including a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years and Â£100m for a further 34 hospitals to start developing future projects. This is on top of an extra Â£20bn in funding agreed by Theresa May's government up to 2023. Could the NHS be 'up for sale' to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked A really simple guide to the election,external How much does a general election cost? Labour argues the NHS is reeling from the tightest funding squeeze in modern history since 2010, which it says has left nearly four and half million people waiting for treatment and seen thousands of cancelled operations last year. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will end austerity in the NHS via a ""proper funding settlement"", with the exact details to be announced ahead of the launch of the party's manifesto. Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, mature, evidence-based"" debate on what the NHS needs. ""Let's not resort to the cheap political slogans and skimming across the top which is what we've seen over the last four or five elections,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Writing on the Times website,,externalhe said it was understandable that during election campaigns politicians should ""cast themselves as champions and defenders of the NHS"". However, he warned ""it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon"" - something he said leaders in the health service were worried was already starting to happen in this campaign. It is unrealistic to expect the parties to dial down their highly-charged debates on the subject. But NHS Providers argues that already things are getting out of hand with signs that the NHS is being ""weaponised"". Underlying all this is a warning that the NHS in England cannot seem to keep up with growing demand for care, which is ""particularly worrying"" with winter looming. Hospital chiefs are known to be concerned that there was intense pressure in recent weeks before winter had really set in. How that pressure develops before polling day could be a major issue in this campaign. While there were areas where ""the NHS is falling short"", he said ""over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients"". And Carrie MacEwen, from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said undeliverable promises ""simply set up the NHS to fail"". ""The NHS's role is to manage the health of the nation, not to be used as a tool to swing voters in a three-way marginal,"" she told the Times. ""Our fear is in these febrile times we will see irrational, undeliverable promises or even outright lies."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agreed that the NHS ""shouldn't be weaponised"" during the election campaign but voters deserved an ""honest debate about it."" Speaking after a visit to Unison headquarters to meet NHS staff, he also repeated that under a Labour government, the health service would be ""brought back in house"" when privatised contracts ""come to an end"". Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliament Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The Tories have repudiated Labour claims that privatisation has exploded in recent years, pointing to figures showing the total number of private contracts has remained static at 7% in the past four years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock accused Labour of peddling ""scare stories"" to try and win votes because they have ""nothing positive to offer"". ""These stories worry some of the most vulnerable people in the country, who the Labour Party used to say they represented,"" he said in a video message on Twitter. ""It is only with the Conservatives, with our strong support for the economy, that we can make sure the health service is always there for you and your family."" But former Conservative health secretary Stephen Dorrell, who is standing as a Lib Dem candidate in the election, said both the main parties were driven by ideology when it came to the issue. The NHS, he told the BBC Radio 4's World at One, was a ""perfect example of a place where our economy works best when the public and private work together"".

'Comfort women' film to be shown in Japan amid row,"A statue of a ""comfort woman"" pictured outside of the Japanese embassy in Seoul A Japanese film festival will now show a documentary on forced wartime sex workers after its earlier decision to cancel the screening sparked a backlash. The festival in Kawasaki said safety concerns had now been resolved.

Japanese nationalists deny the women were coerced into sex work. The sex slave who refused to be silenced Why South Korea and Japan have fallen out 'Comfort women' - a painful legacy Earlier this year an exhibition on the issue of ""comfort women"" was forced to close for two months after it was threatened with arson. The decision not to screen the film was reversed after ""lots of voices offering cooperation to address our safety concerns"", a member of the organising committee told AFP news agency. Several directors involved in the film festival had criticised plans not to show the film. One even pulled his own film from the festival in protest. ""Shusenjo: The Main Battleground of the Comfort Women Issue"" will now be shown on the last day of the festival. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Severe pollution drives Delhi to car rationing,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey shows what it's like driving through the high levels of smog in Delhi India's top court has accused state governments of ""passing the buck"" on air pollution and failing to take action to tackle Delhi's toxic smog. The Supreme Court said authorities were only interested in ""gimmicks"", rather than concrete measures to combat pollution levels. Levels of dangerous particles in the air - known as PM2.5 - are at well over 10 times safe limits in the capital. City authorities have responded by launching a car rationing system. The fight against air pollution in three global cities ""Delhi is choking every year and we are unable to do anything,"" said Supreme Court Justice Arun Mishra. ""The state machinery is not actingâ¦ They are passing the buck to each other... Everybody is interested in gimmicks and elections."" From 4 to 15 November, cars with odd or even number plates will only be allowed on the roads on alternate days, officials said. Such a system has been used before but it is not clear if it helps lower pollution levels. This video can not be played 'It's making us sick but we have nowhere to go': Delhi's homeless sleep in the smog Cars are not believed to be the main cause of Delhi's toxic air, with experts pointing instead to crop burning by farmers in neighbouring states to clear fields. Health officials have asked people to stay indoors and refrain from doing any physical activity as millions are at risk of respiratory illness. Schools are closed until Tuesday and the shutdown is likely to be extended until Friday as the city chokes under a thick blanket of smog. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the car rationing system, known as the ""odd-even plan"", would take hundreds of thousands of cars off the road. Those ignoring the rule face a fine of 4,000 rupees (Â£44; $56) - double that of previous years. by Krutika Pathi, BBC News, Delhi Teary eyes, a throat like sandpaper, and a hacking cough that left me breathless - these were the side effects after I went for a walk around my neighbourhood in Delhi. Whenever ""pollution season"" starts to set in, I notice the changes in my body rather quickly. I've lost count of the number of times I've woken up with a severe cough during the winter season. From your nose to your chest, it feels like things aren't working the way they should be. On some days, it's just a blocked nose and on others, it's almost a struggle to breathe normally. The effects go beyond the physical too. I'm constantly thinking about Air Quality Index numbers and whether the air is breathable - I even activate my air purifier via an app as I leave work so that my room has clean air by the time I'm home. ""The perfect storm of conditions during November has created almost 30% higher atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter,"" said a Cornell University study published in July. Delhi's geography - it is landlocked and sits on a flat plain that is blocked off by the Himalayas - means it is more drastically affected. Only public transport, emergency vehicles, taxis and two-wheelers will be allowed. Women driving alone will also be exempt from the rule. The Supreme Court has ordered Delhi's state government to produce data which proves that the car rationing system works. Experts say emissions from vehicles are just one of several factors that have turned the city into - in Mr Kejriwal's words - a ""gas chamber"". A major cause of the high pollution levels at this time of year is farmers in neighbouring states burning crop stubble to clear their fields. This creates a lethal cocktail of particulate matter and gases - carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide - all worsened by fireworks set off during the Hindu festival of Diwali a week ago. Construction and industrial emissions have also contributed to the smog. How a food crisis led to Delhi's foul smog Millions of masks given out in 'gas chamber' Delhi Delhi's foul air came from India's farming revolution How do Ultra Low Emissions Zones work? Efforts to identify a cause have sparked a row between state and federal politicians, with Mr Kejriwal calling on the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana to crack down on crop burning. Federal Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar accused Mr Kejriwal of politicising the issue and painting his neighbours as ""villains"". The Supreme Court also summoned the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states to appear before it to answer questions about efforts to tackle stubble burning. The level of PM2.5 - tiny particulates that can enter deep into the lungs - was at one point seven times higher than in the Chinese capital Beijing, which has battled similar pollution problems in recent years. Five million masks were handed out in schoolson Friday as officials declared a public health emergency. Part of the reason is a change in crop cycles and harvesting in the agricultural states of Punjab and Haryana. A decade ago the two states passed identical laws intended to preserve ground water, which effectively compelled farmers to plant their rice crops in mid-June rather than at the end of April, as was the tradition. This was to enable them to make use of monsoonal rains to grow the heavily water-dependent crop. A traffic policeman wears a mask to protect himself at a busy junction The delay in the planting cycle meant the harvesting cycle was also delayed. Farmers now have much less time to prepare their fields for the next crop cycle and burning stubble is a cheap and effective way to clear the land. Unfortunately, this coincides with changing wind patterns over Delhi and the rest of north India. India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has recommended some guidelines for residents of Delhi to cope with the elevated smog levels. They include avoiding strenuous activities and hard labour if possible, and exercising indoors. When outdoors, avoiding main roads and congested areas can help, as smaller roads and bylanes tend to be less polluted. Wearing a mask can help filter out pollutants, but simple surgical masks or comfort masks will not. A smog mask with a respirator is recommended. Do not burn rubbish or other discarded items outdoors, and try to avoid or share car trips to reduce the number of cars on the road. Are you in Delhi?

NHS given extra Â£10m to ease winter pressures,"The NHS in Scotland is to receive Â£10m to help cope with the ""particular pressures"" of winter, the health secretary has announced. Jeane Freeman said the money would go to health boards and the ambulance service to ensure they were ""well prepared"" for the coming months. The money will be spent on staffing and efforts to tackle bed blocking. It comes as Labour's Richard Leonard accused Scottish ministers of ""failing to plan for the future of the NHS"". Watchdogs last month warned Scotland's NHS was""seriously struggling to become financially sustainable"". Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, will receive the biggest share of the cash, almost Â£2.14m, with NHS Lothian in line to receive more than Â£1.4m. Ms Freeman said the funding would help ensure those who were well enough to leave hospital could be discharged at weekends and over holiday periods. She added: ""Winter creates particular pressures on our health and social care system, so it's important that we are well prepared."" Jeane Freeman said the money would support boards as well as health and social care services She said the money would support boards as well as health and social care services. Speaking ahead of a visit to Monklands Hospital in North Lanarkshire, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accused the Scottish government of being ""asleep at the wheel"" when it came to the management of the health service. The Central Scotland MSP will highlight what he describes as a ""catalogue of missed targets that ministers have set for themselves"". He will say: ""Be in no doubt: you cannot trust the Tories with our NHS - they opposed its creation, and they are intent on destroying it once and for all if we leave the EU.

Essex lorry deaths should be 'wake-up call' - MPs,"The deaths of 39 Vietnamese people in the back of a lorry in Essex should act as a ""wake-up call for the government"" over its migration policy, MPs say. A report from the Foreign Affairs Select Committee says the UK's policy of closing borders drives migrants into smugglers' hands. Committee chair and Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said the UK should ""lead by example"" on the issue. The government said tackling human trafficking is a ""major priority"". The bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in a lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays on 23 October. Mr Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said the incident had ""shocked us all"". Why do people risk their lives to get to the UK? The Vietnamese risking it all to get to Britain What happens to migrants picked up in the Channel? Services for Vietnamese lorry death victims He said: ""The full story won't be clear for some time but this tragedy is not alone. ""Today, hundreds of families across the world are losing loved ones who felt driven to take the fatal gamble to entrust their lives to smugglers. ""This case should serve as a wake-up call to the Foreign Office and to government."" Meanwhile, police investigating the lorry deaths in Nghe An province said eight people have been arrested in connection with people smuggling. Thecommittee's report,externalsays the human cost of so-called ""irregular"" migration - which takes place outside laws, regulations, and agreements - made international partnerships, including with the EU, ""essential"". It found UK representatives ""have already ceased to attend EU-level meetings where irregular migration is discussed"". The committee called on the government to ""urgently resume"" its attendance at the meetings during the delay to Brexit and to seek to attend them afterwards ""wherever it is possible"". During the 2015 refugee crisis, the UK received asylum applications from just 2% of the 1.4m people on the move. The UK used two EU deals to keep numbers down: it opted out of an agreement to redistribute refugees and used another rule to send people to other states. It has a seat in the EU's European Migrant Smuggling Centre, dedicated to gathering intelligence and catching the gangs - and has taken part in naval operations. But after Brexit, nobody knows if the UK will be allowed to take part in any joint initiatives. When Helen Wheeler, a foreign office minister, was quizzed by MPs alongside her chief official on Mediterranean migration, she couldn't say if the UK had been at the EU's last key meeting on tackling illegal migration - it hadn't - or whether it would attend the next. The report finds government agreements to limit irregular migration from certain countries, including Libya, Niger and Sudan, risk ""fuelling human rights abuses, and endorsing authoritarian regimes"". The committee adds it is concerned by evidence of ""dire conditions"" for migrants in northern France, where many of those intending to reach the UK gather. It says the government's focus on security at ports there ""has pushed migrants to take more dangerous routes"" to the UK. Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luon are feared to be among the lorry death victims One witness tells the committee that enhanced security had led to an increase in people trying to get to Britain on small boats across the English Channel. 86 Channel migrants stopped in single day UK and France sign Calais migrant treaty Essex lorry deaths: What we know The committee also says the government should consider ""wider, interlinked factors"" driving irregular migration ""including climate change, conflict, repressive governance and corruption - rather than focusing narrowly on reducing the numbers reaching Europe's borders in the short term"". This video can not be played Calais migrants caught on camera trying to reach the UK - This video has no sound Other recommendations include the expansion of legal pathways to apply for asylum outside Europe. A government spokesperson said: ""Tackling the scourge of human trafficking at every stage of the migrant journey - overseas, at our borders and in the UK - is a major priority. ""The UK does this by addressing irregular migration, from reducing factors driving migration - conflict, instability and poverty - to strengthening border security and counter-trafficking operations.

Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliament,"Government spending is likely to head back towards 1970s levels over the next parliament whichever party wins the general election, research suggests. Think tank the Resolution Foundation said both Labour and the Conservatives were planning big increases in the size of the state. But it said they faced ""huge questions"" over how they would pay for it. The Conservatives said they were focusing on people's priorities. Labour has been contacted for a response. Is this really the end of austerity? UK borrowing up by a fifth over past six months A really simple guide to the UK general election The 1970s are often described as a period of economic turmoil for the UK, with public spending soaring during the decade. Manifestos for the 12 December general election have not been published yet. But the Resolution Foundation, which aims to promote higher living standards for people on low and middle incomes, based its estimates on what the main parties have promised to date, as well as the underlying trends affecting the UK economy. It said that if the Conservatives won and simply maintained current spending levels - which were recently raised - then public spending as a share of the economy was likely to climb to 41.3% by 2023-4. Chancellor Sajid Javid is pumping money into public services that were problematic for the Conservatives at the last election That would be ""well above"" the average of 37.4% seen in the two decades running up to the financial crisis of 2007-8, and ""marginally"" below the 42% seen between 1966 and 1984. However, any further spending increases on areas like the NHS would take it above the 1970s average, the Resolution Foundation said. If Labour won the election, by contrast, the think tank said government spending as a share of GDP was likely to rise to 43.3% by 2023-4. That assumes the party would re-commit to the Â£48.6bn of extra spending it promised in its 2017 manifesto, while investing billions extra in capital infrastructure projects. ""This would mean the size of the state under Labour being significantly above the 1970s average,"" the Resolution Foundation said. John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn want to invest more in infrastructure Labour has argued that its spending plans will create a fairer society and continue to grow the economy. Meanwhile, Chancellor Sajid Javid has recently signalled his desire to boost spending to end austerity. He said: ""We make no apologies for focusing on the people's priorities. At this election, we will set our plans in a fully funded manifesto, balancing the need to keep borrowing under control and investing in our future."" However, the Resolution Foundation said that given current economic uncertainty facing the UK - and the growing cost of an ageing population - both parties needed to explain how they intended to pay for their plans. Matt Whittaker, deputy chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""After an unprecedented decade of austerity, both main parties are gearing up to turn the spending taps back on. ""Whichever party wins is going to face huge questions about how they are going to pay for Britain's growing state. The fact is that whatever promises are made over the course of this election campaign, taxes are going to have to rise over the coming decade.""

"Mothercare UK administration threatens 2,500 jobs","Baby goods retailer Mothercare has said it plans to call in administrators to the troubled firm's UK business, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare said,externalits 79 UK stores were ""not capable"" of achieving a sufficient level of profitability and that so far it had failed to find a buyer. It said its stores would continue to trade as normal for the time being. Analysts said Mothercare had been slow to adapt to competition from rivals and the switch to online retailing. Mothercare has already gone through a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. The process enabled the chain to shut 55 shops. Why the UK's shops are closing down Mothercare memories and what went wrong High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost The firm said the decision to appoint administrators was ""a necessary step in the restructuring and refinancing"" of the group. ""Plans are well advanced and being finalised for execution imminently.  A further announcement will be made in due course,"" it said. Aisa Kara said Mothercare's online offering was not as strong as competitors Aisa Kara's parenting journey started in Mothercare when she used its Babybond ultrasound scanning service. ""I was so anxious waiting for my 12-week scan, and I don't think either of us could believe it was actually happening, so we booked our private appointment,"" she said. ""Everything was OK and we viewed a heartbeat, so we left elated, and as it was in Mothercare we got to buy our first item of baby clothing at the same time. ""We bought all our nursery items and pushchair from there, and my daughter and son have been dressed in Mothercare almost exclusively. ""The baby clothing is beautiful and I love the vintage styles. My only complaint is that the online experience isn't as good as you would have expected from a company trying to keep up with the market."" Other parents recall their Mothercare memories. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""Usdaw is providing our members in Mothercare with the support, representation and advice they need at this difficult and uncertain time. ""We will urge the administrators to treat the staff with dignity and respect, keep them fully informed through the administration process, do everything possible to save jobs and keep as many stores open as possible and prioritise stabilising the business to provide a more certain future."" It is understood Mothercare is in advanced talks to move its pension schemes from its British operations over to its international parent company which remains profitable. As first reported by Sky, the aim is to stop the schemes being placed in the Pension Protection Fund, which would likely result in cuts for members. The company operates in more than 40 overseas territories, which are not subject to administration. In the financial year to March 2019, Mothercare's international business generated profits of Â£28.3m, whereas the UK retail operations lost Â£36.3m. In its heyday, Mothercare had hundreds of stores.  It was the go-to place for new parents.  But it failed to keep up with our changing shopping habits.  Mothercare's UK arm has been loss-making for years.  One big reason is there's so much more competition these days. From Zara and H&M to the major supermarkets, there are no shortages of places to buy children's clothing and often at cheaper prices.  And then there's online, with the likes of Amazon who are able to deliver basic kit to your doorstep within hours of ordering. It has all eaten into Mothercare's market share. Truth is, this is a business that's been losing money for a very long time. Last year's CVA wasn't enough to turn things around.  Mothercare ran out of time and money to try to revive its fortunes. Mothercare's move comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Retail analyst Steve Dresser told the BBC that like collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook, Mothercare had failed to adapt to the world of online retail. ""They got very used to fat margins and a way of trading that's store-based,"" he said. However, the firm had also lost its way on the High Street, with poor store environments that deterred customers.  Ultimately, he said, people did not think of Mothercare first when it came to buying baby goods: ""I think you would be hard-pressed to know what the brand stands for."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mothercare had become ""a byword for trouble on the High Street"", demonstrating ""the failure of well-established brands to stay afloat"". She added: ""Other retailers, particularly those who have also previously filed for CVAs, will be concerned that these restructuring plans haven't succeeded and a more radical approach may be required in order to survive."" Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""This is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the High Street... the cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits. ""Years of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.""

Simple guide to the election,"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

Why the UK's shops are closing down,"Hardly a month goes by without news of another wave of shops shutting or of stores losing money. Retailers are holding on to more space than they can pay for, and costs are shooting up, reports suggest. So, what is behind the High Street crisis? Fashion chains Karen Millen and Coast recently announced closures. They had more than 100 outlets and concessions between them. The fast-growing online fashion chain Boohoo snapped up the brands following their collapse. But Boohoo isn't interested in owning and running physical stores and so relaunched them as online-only retailers. The number of empty shops already stands at a record high. In Julythe proportion of all shops that are empty reached 10.3%, its highest level since January 2015. Last year, big chains such as Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld went bust and vanished altogether. New research also indicates the top 150 UK retailers have 20% more store space than they need and can afford. Some shops such as Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look have done restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of shops between them. In many ways, retail is a pretty simple business. You have to sell things for more than you paid for them But in the past few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers. Department stores such as Debenhams have been struggling with soaring costs Companies have had to deal with rising costs. Researchers at A&M and Retail Economics suggest during the past five years, companies have had to spend 10.8% more on things such as business rates, increasing wages and rents. And, at the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to rapidly changing shopping habits. Consumers now spend one in every five pounds online - and if businesses are seeing 20% fewer sales on the shop floor as well as their fixed costs rising, then profit margins will be squeezed. Online spending usually peaks around the festive season This huge shift in spending is making businesses think again about how they make money. Too many retailers either fail or are unable to adapt. Those with underlying problems have suffered. Take Debenhams, it's been struggling for years. Its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt and it was tied into long leases. Another department store, House of Fraser, was rescued last year by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. He outlined a plan to create the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and said about 80% of the stores would remain open. But he's now admitted the business was losing more than Â£1m a week. Consumers are spending increasing amounts of their disposable income on experiences and lifestyle. Being mediocre isn't good enough anymore. Shoppers are making fewer visits to High Streets. The retail analytics company Springboard tracks footfall in main towns and cities. It's seen a decline in numbers for the past few years. Bad weather and a reduced appetite for spending by consumers have played a role along the way. Consumers are still shopping, of course. But even with the rise of online, shops need people to walk through the door. From March 2016 to 2019, UK retail lost 106,000 jobs according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Those figures are based on data from the Office for National Statistics. Poundworld saw the biggest job losses, with more than 5,000 redundancies. Toys R Us and Maplin also lost 5,500 jobs between them. This year, the fallout from various restructurings includes 1,000 job losses andplunging profits at Sir Philip Green's Arcadia groupand 100 redundancies at the fashion retailer LK Bennett. More job losses will come.More than two years ago, the BRC warnedthere would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade. Although the first half of this year saw a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on British High Streets, there were some bright spots. Takeaways, gyms and specialist vaping shops were some categories that saw the largest increases in store openings. Analysts have said this demonstrates the High Street's move away from traditional retailing. Supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are two of the big names also continuing to open lots of stores. But the overall picture is the UK has too many shops, they're too big and in the wrong locations. The winners will be the companies that know what their consumers want and give it to them, with great service and products they want to buy.

NHS claims fact-checked,"The exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions between Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn previewed one of the issues that could dominate the coming election campaign: the future of the NHS. So what was said and who got their facts right? The government pledgedbillions of pounds for hospital projectsacross England, at the start of the Conservative Party conference last month. But while the plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years, a further 34 hospitals will share only an initial Â£100m in funding to start developing future projects. A substantial amount of extra money would be needed to bring those plans to fruition. So it's not correct to suggest that 40 new hospitals are currently being built. Mr Corbyn is right that the NHS has become worse at meeting all of its key waiting time targets for cancer treatment. The proportion of patients having their first treatment within 62 days of a GP referral for suspected cancer has fallen from 86% to 79% since 2010. This is relatively small in percentage point terms, but it represents thousands of people waiting longer to be seen. Cancer survival has doubled during the past 40 years and since 2010 it has continued to improve at roughly the same rate as in previous years. Estimates suggest the proportion of people surviving for one year after their cancer diagnosis increased from 70% to 73% between 2010 and 2016 so the prime minister is correct. And that is the same rate of improvement as in the six years before that. It's certainly true to say this has been the most dramatic spending squeeze in the history of the NHS in England. The NHS budget has never fallen under any government and on average it has risen by 3.6% a year, allowing for inflation (rising prices) since 1949. But between 2010 and 2018, it rose by just 1.3% on average. Last year, more money was announced that will bring the annual increase over the next five years to 3.4% - below the long-term average but an increase on most of the past decade. The prime minister's figures are broadly correct. According toNHS workforce data,external, there are now 18,055 more doctors employed directly by the NHS to work in hospitals than there were in May 2010, and 16,989 more general nurses. Mr Corbyn is also correct to say there are currently about 43,000 nursing vacancies across the NHS. Why do we need roughly 60,000 more nurses now than we did a decade ago? Because the UK population is ageing and increasing - that's why healthcare is such an important political issue. NHS Wales is run by the Labour-led Welsh Government, while NHS England is under the control of the Conservatives. There is a list of targets that haven't been met by both health services, including the widely publicised accident and emergency waiting times. This target aims to ensure at least 95% of patients who attend A&E are dealt with within four hours of arriving. It hasn't been met in England since 2015, while in Wales it has not been met in at least a decade. Is NHS funding worse in Wales? The Welsh Government allocates budgets for certain departments, such as health and education, but the overall pot is broadly determined by central government. And Mr Corbyn said the problems in Wales stemmed from cuts by Conservative central governments to the Welsh Government budget. Funding was cut,externalbetween 2011 and 2017 before it started slowly increasing again. But real-terms spending in Wales on public services overall won't return to where it was in 2010 for another three years. Expect to hear a lot from Labour in this election about a post-Brexit""Trump trade deal""and the price the NHS would pay as a result. Mr Corbyn certainly pushed the point home in Parliament, while the prime minister insisted the NHS would always be protected. In the end, as with so much in Brexit, it depends on what is negotiated.

NHS 'reality check' for Johnson,"Boris Johnson visited a hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire this week There has been a string of health announcements for England this week - funding for new buildings and equipment, a deal to sort out doctors' pension tax problems, and a new artificial intelligence lab. And Whitehall sources make clear there will be more to come when MPs return from their summer holidays next month. In his first NHS policy initiative, Boris Johnson said it was his ""mission"" to reduce the time people waited, both to see a GP and in accident and emergency units. It is understood that he sees the NHS as a priority in his first months in office and is attempting to seize the initiative ahead of a possibly imminent general election. But the latest statistics on the state of the NHS in England serve as a reality check for the new prime minister and his administration. Record numbers (2.27 million) came through the doors of A&E units in England in July, up 4% on the same month the previous year. The heatwave was given as one reason, but the underlying story is unchanged, which is worrying for health service leaders. Their aim has been to get more people treated away from hospitals in their local communities.  But the opposite is happening as more patients, some frustrated by difficulties getting GP appointments, are turning up at A&E and putting more pressure on hospitals. There were just over 554,000 emergency admissions to hospitals in July - the third highest monthly figure since modern records began and, what's more, in the middle of summer. More strain on A&E and more demand for urgent hospital care puts the squeeze on bed capacity. Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? 20 NHS building projects given green light Boris Johnson announces Â£1.8bn cash boost for NHS hospitals One major hospital reported being full. The result is that patients waiting for non-urgent surgery experience longer delays. The total waiting list in England has hit a new peak of 4.4 million. The number of patients waiting more than the 18-week target for routine operations and procedures has gone above 600,000 for the first time in a decade. The data will make sobering reading in Downing Street. Turning around NHS performance is a big ask. The cash boost for the front line this year, the first part of the five-year plan announced by Theresa May, has helped. But, as many analysts predicted, it has been barely enough to keep up with the increased demand for patient care, let alone reverse the backlog of operations or improve the A&E numbers. The Royal College of Surgeons says nothing short of a long-term plan to increase the number of beds and staff and resources to run the wards will suffice. Mr Johnson announced his own Â£1.8bn funding increase for the NHS, but for hospital buildings and equipment (the capital budget) rather than day-to-day spending.  So was it new money? That question has been hotly debated. Of that package, Â£850m is new in that it will be provided over five years by the Treasury to fund 20 hospital upgrade projects and had not been announced before. Much of the other Â£1bn actually comes from surpluses built up by hospitals in earlier years, which they were not allowed to spend at the time. That bar has now been lifted by the Treasury, which has given the green light for the hospitals to spend the money this year.  So it is not new cash, in the sense some members of the public might understand it. But it is funding which is newly available to the NHS. Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust, was the first analyst to highlight the funding mechanism. She argued that ""to claim this as new money is a little like finally giving back the Â£10 you borrowed some time ago - and expecting to be applauded wildly"". However, the prime minister and health secretary continued to insist the Â£1.8bn was new money. The argument, according to sources, was that the funding had not been previously accessible and that the government announcement had freed it up to spend on improving hospitals. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, tactfully concluded that both Ms Gainsbury and the government were correct. The result of the latest announcement is that the capital spending assumption for the current financial year in the Department of Health and Social Care accounts has been raised by Â£1bn. Whatever the argument about the nature of the funding in England, the devolved administrations will receive new money as a result of the usual mechanism (the Barnett formula applied to the Â£1.8bn package), amounting to a total of Â£350m for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This may sound like an arcane wrangle over dry-as-dust accounting practices. But with a general election possibly not far off, it is important. Statements about where money is coming from and how it is spent will rightly be closely scrutinised, as will performance figures from the NHS front line.

"Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliamentGovernment spending will climb to 1970s levels, whichever party wins the election, research claims.Business","Government spending is likely to head back towards 1970s levels over the next parliament whichever party wins the general election, research suggests. Think tank the Resolution Foundation said both Labour and the Conservatives were planning big increases in the size of the state. But it said they faced ""huge questions"" over how they would pay for it. The Conservatives said they were focusing on people's priorities. Labour has been contacted for a response. Is this really the end of austerity? UK borrowing up by a fifth over past six months A really simple guide to the UK general election The 1970s are often described as a period of economic turmoil for the UK, with public spending soaring during the decade. Manifestos for the 12 December general election have not been published yet. But the Resolution Foundation, which aims to promote higher living standards for people on low and middle incomes, based its estimates on what the main parties have promised to date, as well as the underlying trends affecting the UK economy. It said that if the Conservatives won and simply maintained current spending levels - which were recently raised - then public spending as a share of the economy was likely to climb to 41.3% by 2023-4. Chancellor Sajid Javid is pumping money into public services that were problematic for the Conservatives at the last election That would be ""well above"" the average of 37.4% seen in the two decades running up to the financial crisis of 2007-8, and ""marginally"" below the 42% seen between 1966 and 1984. However, any further spending increases on areas like the NHS would take it above the 1970s average, the Resolution Foundation said. If Labour won the election, by contrast, the think tank said government spending as a share of GDP was likely to rise to 43.3% by 2023-4. That assumes the party would re-commit to the Â£48.6bn of extra spending it promised in its 2017 manifesto, while investing billions extra in capital infrastructure projects. ""This would mean the size of the state under Labour being significantly above the 1970s average,"" the Resolution Foundation said. John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn want to invest more in infrastructure Labour has argued that its spending plans will create a fairer society and continue to grow the economy. Meanwhile, Chancellor Sajid Javid has recently signalled his desire to boost spending to end austerity. He said: ""We make no apologies for focusing on the people's priorities. At this election, we will set our plans in a fully funded manifesto, balancing the need to keep borrowing under control and investing in our future."" However, the Resolution Foundation said that given current economic uncertainty facing the UK - and the growing cost of an ageing population - both parties needed to explain how they intended to pay for their plans. Matt Whittaker, deputy chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""After an unprecedented decade of austerity, both main parties are gearing up to turn the spending taps back on. ""Whichever party wins is going to face huge questions about how they are going to pay for Britain's growing state. The fact is that whatever promises are made over the course of this election campaign, taxes are going to have to rise over the coming decade."" It said that Labour had specified Â£49bn of tax rises, but these were unlikely to be enough to fully fund its plans. On the other hand, it said the Conservatives had placed more of an emphasis on tax cuts - leaving an ""even bigger funding question"" over their economic plans. Is this really the end of austerity?

MPs to elect next Commons SpeakerDeputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle and Harriet Harman are among eight candidates vying to succeed John Bercow.Election 2019,"This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House MPs are voting between the final two candidates to succeed John Bercow as Speaker, in what is the first election for the post in more than a decade. In the third round of voting Sir Lindsay Hoyle received the most votes at 267, followed by Chris Bryant with 169 and Dame Eleanor Laing was eliminated with 127. The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. The result of the final ballot is expected about 20:00 GMT. Seven candidates were originally in the running. Having received the least number of votes, Dame Rosie Winterton had to leave the contest in the second round of voting and Harriet Harman voluntarily withdrew her candidacy. Labour MP Meg Hillier and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh were knocked out in the first round of the contest after receiving 10 and 11 votes respectively. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. LIVE: Speaker contest under way Ken Clarke is leading the proceedings The first to speak was Labour's Dame Rosie Winterton. She said the Speaker's job was ""not to dominate proceedings or speak for Parliament"", and promised to ""douse the flames not pour petrol on them"". Another Labour MP Chris Bryant said he believed in ""a Speaker who will stand by the rules, who is completely impartial and who knows Erskine May [the parliamentary rule book] back to front"", adding: ""I've got it lying by my bedside."" He also pledged to end clapping in the chamber and ""sort out the wi-fi"" - pledges that were themselves met with clapping from those listening. John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker How MPs will choose the next Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said a Speaker should ""submerge their character in the job"" and be ""a quiet voice"". He also said the preservation of parliamentary buildings should be done ""in the interests of our paymaster - the taxpayers"". ""We cannot waste billions of pounds,"" he said. Current deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing expressed sadness at the number of MPs deciding not to run again at the December election and vowed to stand up for all members if selected for the job. She said Parliament needed to ""escape from the hierarchical structures that allow bullying to take root"". Also addressing the subject of bullying, Labour's Meg Hillier said MPs needed to protect staff in the House, warning bullying ""will become the next expenses scandal"". Mr Bercow was criticised for not doing more to tackle allegations of bullying and harassment in the Commons, and was himself accused of mistreating several members of staff, which he denied. Chris Bryant admitted to keeping a book on parliamentary procedure by his bedside Another current deputy Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said he had introduced security measures for MPs ""so we can feel safe"". ""I will not let you down,"" he promised MPs. Former deputy leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman was last to make her pitch, promising to take on a fourth deputy drawn from one of the smaller parties. She said she had ""an unparallel record of reform"", pointing to her campaign to allow pregnant MPs and new parents to vote by proxy. The candidates made their pitches under the gaze of former Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Labour MP Stella Creasy got a picture of the baroness sitting in the gallery Allow Instagram content?

Candidates needed the support of at least 12 MPs, three of whom have to be from a different party, in order to be eligible to take part. MPs have 20 minutes to vote in a secret ballot. It will take about 45 minutes to count them. If no candidate receives more half of the votes, the individual who receives the least votes will drop out, as will anyone who obtains less than 5% of the total cast. After each round, there will be a 10-minute period for candidates to withdraw. MPs will then continue to vote until one candidate obtains more than half of the votes. The process is being overseen by Ken Clarke, who as Father of the House is the long-serving MP in the Commons. Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle is regarded as the frontrunner for the role Labour's Harriet Harman has said she wants to put an end to ""the Old Boys' Club"" in Parliament Dame Eleanor Laing has said she would ""do things differently"" from Mr Bercow The seven contenders at the start of the race were: Chris Bryant- former minister and shadow Commons leader; Labour MP for Rhondda since 2001 Harriet Harman- former minister and deputy Labour leader; Labour MP since 1982, for Peckham and its successor constituency Camberwell Meg Hillier- chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and former minister; Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 Sir Lindsay Hoyle- elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2010 Dame Eleanor Laing- elected Conservative MP for Epping Forest in 1997; elected deputy Speaker in 2013 Sir Edward Leigh- Conservative MP for Gainsborough since 1983; former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Dame Rosie Winterton- elected Labour MP for Doncaster Central in 1997; former Labour chief whip; elected deputy Speaker in 2017 BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said most observers believed Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - was the frontrunner. ""As Chairman of Ways and Means, he chairs Budget debates and selects amendments for committee stage proceedings on bills, and has had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his credentials,"" our correspondent says. Sir Lindsay said MPs backing him included Conservative Charles Walker, who was one of Mr Bercow's key allies during his tenure, former sports minister Tracey Crouch and Brexit-backing Labour MP Caroline Flint.

The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked. By Mark D'Arcy, the BBC's parliamentary correspondent So what might MPs want in a new Speaker? First, there seems be an appetite for a different style - an end to Bercow-esque grandiloquence and those five-minute appeals for brevity, as well as for an end to the kind of clashes with MPs that the departed Speaker was prone to. Remember his red-faced finger-jabbing clash with the then Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, or this week's spat with long-time Bercow critic Andrew Bridgen? Then there's the much more important concern about the Speaker's sweeping powers to make the rules in the Commons, a power which saw him permitting amendments to Business of the House motions which were supposed to be taken ""forthwith"" - which many MPs believed meant they could not be amended. Given no one party has a majority in the House, the winning candidate will be the one most capable of reaching across party lines, and building a majority out of factions of the main parties, the members of the smaller parties and their personal supporters. Those seen as party gladiators first and foremost may find that hard to do.

Plaid Cymru's 'ambition for Wales without limit'Leader Adam Price will outline the party's plans at its general election campaign launch.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Leader Adam Price said returning more Plaid Cymru MPs would make Downing Street 'listen to Wales' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said no other party has a ""higher ambition for Wales"" as he launched its general election campaign on Monday. Mr Price told supporters in Menai Bridge, Anglesey, that Westminster policies had failed Wales. Plaid wants to add to its tally of four MPs, with Ynys Mon a top target, and has not ruled out electoral pacts. It wants another referendum on Brexit in which it would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. In September, Mr Price called for his party to go into a snap pollpromising to cancel Brexitwithout the need for a further referendum, but party members voted to support another vote on membership unless there is a prospect of a no-deal Brexit. What would a Welsh 'remain election pact' mean? General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator - understand the lingo A really simple guide to the UK general election ""The key message from us is that for a 100 years we've put our faith in the Westminster parties and where has it got us,"" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price told BBC Wales. ""We're at the bottom of every league table that you care to mention - child poverty is rising and life expectancy is falling. ""The way we can solve things is not by putting our faith in Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson but by putting faith in ourselves and by sending the biggest number ever of Plaid MPs to Westminster"". Jane Dodds (left) won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election after Plaid Cymru and the Green Party did not field candidates In August, Plaid Cymru did not field a candidate in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election after entering a pact with the Liberal Democrats and Green Party to avoid splitting the remain vote. The seatwas won by Lib Dem Jane Dodds, Despite reports they have reached a wider electoral pact for the election on 12 December,Plaid sources said the discussions within and between the parties continue. The party won four seats in the 2017 election, including slender margins of 104 in Ceredigion and 92 in Arfon, while 16 of its 40 candidates lost their deposits after failing to secure 5% of the constituency votes. ButPlaid came second in May's European elections in Walesand beat Labour in a Wales-wide election for the first time. Mr Price said: ""These are unique times... wherever possible we should look to maximise the number of pro-remain MPs"". ""We haven't reached a final agreement yet"", he said, emphasising Plaid was in consultation with local parties. ""This is the right thing to do where it's possible"", he said. ""There are times in politics where you've got to put the public interest and the national interest before narrow party interest. It's painful and it doesn't come naturally, it's the kind of leadership I think people are looking for"". Adam Price launched his party's general election campaign in Anglesey this morning The party is campaigning for a ""Welsh green jobs revolution"", the creation of a Welsh justice system - which includes the transfer of policing powers to Cardiff - and Â£50m to recruit 1,600 new police officers. Other pledges announced ahead of the launch relate to issues that are the responsibility of the Welsh Government - social care, childcare and building affordable homes. Asked whether the party was deliberately confusing matters, a Plaid Cymru source said: ""Many of the issues are decided in Westminster or their funding allocated there. ""The sad fact of the matter, however, is the media still does not understand devolution, so we have to talk about the whole range of issues that matter to people's lives."" Claims about Wales fact-checked Mr Price said Plaid Cymru's ambition for Wales is ""without limit"" and aimed to win the party's most seats at an election. ""We have to take our country from where it's been bumping along at the bottom of every league table you can imagine,"" he said. ""There's nothing inevitable about poverty as a nation. It's the poverty of leadership we've had from the Westminster parties. ""We have to take the opportunity to change that at this election, to back ourselves, believe in ourselves and vote for our party."" Mr Price said Wales has not been taken seriously at Westminster, adding: ""Compare Wales to Scotland and Northern Ireland and we're just invisible in the corridors of Whitehall.""

Labour pledges to save free TV licences,"Labour has pledged to keep free TV licences for over-75s if it wins power in the 12 December general election. The BBC has said from 2020 only those on pension credit will qualify, after it was made responsible for funding them under the charter agreement. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson told the Daily Mirror the removal of the benefit was ""utterly callous"". It has also beenreported that Boris Johnson is looking to save the perk,,externalas part of his election campaign. According to the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister has ordered officials to find a way to ensure no over 75s would need to pay as a ""priority"". The BBC and the government have come under fierce criticism over the move to scrap free licences to all people aged over 75, which wasannounced in June. The decision came after the government made the BBC shoulder the cost of the benefit as part of its funding settlement. The corporation said retaining the benefit for all over-75s would have cost Â£745m - a fifth of the BBC's budget - by 2021-22 and led to ""unprecedented closures"". Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader,made the party's announcement in the Mirror, saying:,external""Four in 10 older people say the TV is their main source of company, but from next year 3.7 million older people will lose their free TV licence. ""It's disgraceful. Our message is clear - vote Labour to save free TV licences."" Paul Johnson, director of economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),questioned the idea of free licences for over-75s.,external He highlighted IFS analysis produced earlier this year which showed that households receiving a free licence had, on average, significantly lower poverty rates than other social groups, for example, families with children. However, charities such as Age UK have supported free licences for over-75s. In July, they organisedan open letter addressed to the next prime minister,external, signed by public figures including Dame Helen Mirren and Ricky Tomlinson, arguing they helped older people facing loneliness. The letter said: ""For those who have lost a loved one, live alone, don't have family around and live with poor mobility and health issues, the TV provides a great source of companionship. ""It helps them connect to the outside world and brings news and entertainment to lonely and dark days."" Last month,a committee of MPs urged both the BBC and government to find a way to keep the benefit.

Mothercare UK set to call in administratorsThe baby goods retailer says its 79 UK stores are unable to trade profitably.Business,"Baby goods retailer Mothercare has said it plans to call in administrators to the troubled firm's UK business, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare said,externalits 79 UK stores were ""not capable"" of achieving a sufficient level of profitability and that so far it had failed to find a buyer. It said its stores would continue to trade as normal for the time being. Analysts said Mothercare had been slow to adapt to competition from rivals and the switch to online retailing. Mothercare has already gone through a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. The process enabled the chain to shut 55 shops. Why the UK's shops are closing down Mothercare memories and what went wrong High Street woes mount as 85,000 jobs feared lost The firm said the decision to appoint administrators was ""a necessary step in the restructuring and refinancing"" of the group. ""Plans are well advanced and being finalised for execution imminently.  A further announcement will be made in due course,"" it said. Aisa Kara said Mothercare's online offering was not as strong as competitors Aisa Kara's parenting journey started in Mothercare when she used its Babybond ultrasound scanning service. ""I was so anxious waiting for my 12-week scan, and I don't think either of us could believe it was actually happening, so we booked our private appointment,"" she said. ""Everything was OK and we viewed a heartbeat, so we left elated, and as it was in Mothercare we got to buy our first item of baby clothing at the same time. ""We bought all our nursery items and pushchair from there, and my daughter and son have been dressed in Mothercare almost exclusively. ""The baby clothing is beautiful and I love the vintage styles. My only complaint is that the online experience isn't as good as you would have expected from a company trying to keep up with the market."" Other parents recall their Mothercare memories. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""Usdaw is providing our members in Mothercare with the support, representation and advice they need at this difficult and uncertain time. ""We will urge the administrators to treat the staff with dignity and respect, keep them fully informed through the administration process, do everything possible to save jobs and keep as many stores open as possible and prioritise stabilising the business to provide a more certain future."" It is understood Mothercare is in advanced talks to move its pension schemes from its British operations over to its international parent company which remains profitable. As first reported by Sky, the aim is to stop the schemes being placed in the Pension Protection Fund, which would likely result in cuts for members. The company operates in more than 40 overseas territories, which are not subject to administration. In the financial year to March 2019, Mothercare's international business generated profits of Â£28.3m, whereas the UK retail operations lost Â£36.3m. In its heyday, Mothercare had hundreds of stores.  It was the go-to place for new parents.  But it failed to keep up with our changing shopping habits.  Mothercare's UK arm has been loss-making for years.  One big reason is there's so much more competition these days. From Zara and H&M to the major supermarkets, there are no shortages of places to buy children's clothing and often at cheaper prices.  And then there's online, with the likes of Amazon who are able to deliver basic kit to your doorstep within hours of ordering. It has all eaten into Mothercare's market share. Truth is, this is a business that's been losing money for a very long time. Last year's CVA wasn't enough to turn things around.  Mothercare ran out of time and money to try to revive its fortunes. Mothercare's move comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Retail analyst Steve Dresser told the BBC that like collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook, Mothercare had failed to adapt to the world of online retail. ""They got very used to fat margins and a way of trading that's store-based,"" he said. However, the firm had also lost its way on the High Street, with poor store environments that deterred customers.  Ultimately, he said, people did not think of Mothercare first when it came to buying baby goods: ""I think you would be hard-pressed to know what the brand stands for."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mothercare had become ""a byword for trouble on the High Street"", demonstrating ""the failure of well-established brands to stay afloat"". She added: ""Other retailers, particularly those who have also previously filed for CVAs, will be concerned that these restructuring plans haven't succeeded and a more radical approach may be required in order to survive."" Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""This is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the High Street... the cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits. ""Years of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.""

The company operates in more than 40 overseas territories, which are not subject to administration. In the financial year to March 2019, Mothercare's international business generated profits of Â£28.3m, whereas the UK retail operations lost Â£36.3m. In its heyday, Mothercare had hundreds of stores.  It was the go-to place for new parents.  But it failed to keep up with our changing shopping habits.  Mothercare's UK arm has been loss-making for years.  One big reason is there's so much more competition these days. From Zara and H&M to the major supermarkets, there are no shortages of places to buy children's clothing and often at cheaper prices.  And then there's online, with the likes of Amazon who are able to deliver basic kit to your doorstep within hours of ordering. It has all eaten into Mothercare's market share. Truth is, this is a business that's been losing money for a very long time. Last year's CVA wasn't enough to turn things around.  Mothercare ran out of time and money to try to revive its fortunes. Mothercare's move comes as High Street retailers continue to face tough times amid a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Retail analyst Steve Dresser told the BBC that like collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook, Mothercare had failed to adapt to the world of online retail. ""They got very used to fat margins and a way of trading that's store-based,"" he said. However, the firm had also lost its way on the High Street, with poor store environments that deterred customers.  Ultimately, he said, people did not think of Mothercare first when it came to buying baby goods: ""I think you would be hard-pressed to know what the brand stands for."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Mothercare had become ""a byword for trouble on the High Street"", demonstrating ""the failure of well-established brands to stay afloat"". She added: ""Other retailers, particularly those who have also previously filed for CVAs, will be concerned that these restructuring plans haven't succeeded and a more radical approach may be required in order to survive."" Richard Lim, boss of independent research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""This is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the High Street... the cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits. ""Years of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.""

Trump threatens to pull California wildfire funds,"Fierce fires have burned thousands of acres of California US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding for the wildfires sweeping California, in a Twitter spat with the state's governor. Nearly 100,000 acres have been destroyed by wildfires in recent weeks, and thousands have been forced from their homes. Mr Trump blamed Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, saying he had done a ""terrible job of forest management"". Several of this year's major wildfires have burned in unforested areas. ""Every year, as the fire's (sic) rage & California burns, it is the same thing - and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. Mr Newsom, who has been highly critical of Mr Trump's environmental policies, responded: ""You don't believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation."" California wildfires 'can now happen in any year' Increased temperatures due to global warmingare causing huge wildfires in California, according to a recent study published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,external. Drier, warmer conditions lead to vegetation drying out and becoming more flammable. President Trump made a similar threat to cut federal aid in 2018, when the most deadly fire in California's history killed 86 people. In California, 57% of forested areas are managed by federal agencies such as the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. In 2018, the state requested $72 million (Â£55.6 million) in reimbursements from the US Forest Service, with $9 million (Â£7 million) of that money withheld,the Los Angeles Times reports,external. Firefighters have contained about half of the Maria Fire, the major blaze in southern California. The fire, which broke out on Thursday, has burned more than 9,400 acres, the Ventura County Fire Department said on Sunday. California wildfires 'can now happen in any year' Is Trump right about California wildfires? The largest blaze, the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, was 76% contained on Sunday after burning nearly 80,000 acres since it started on 23 October, officials said.

Call to decriminalise personal use drug possession,"Proposals to introduce drug consumption rooms in Glasgow have been blocked The possession of illicit drugs for personal use should be decriminalised, a report by MPs has said. The Scottish Affairs Committee also recommended the UK government should back safe consumption rooms in Scotland in a bid to tackle drug misuse. Drug-related deaths in Scotland reached an all-time high of 1,187 last year. The Home Office said it had no plans to decriminalise drug possession and that doing so would not eliminate crime associated with the illicit drug trade. All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? However, the committee of 12 Scottish MPs said the government must be open to taking radical steps after the latest figures showed Scotland's death rate from overdoses was far more than the rest of the UK and higher than any other EU country. The cross-party committee, chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart, included four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs. Mr Wishart told BBC's Good Morning Scotland Programme: ""It's disappointing to see such a knee jerk response from the Home Office. ""This is a carefully considered piece of work, the most in-depth inquiry into problem drug use in Scotland ever conducted. ""Criminalising drug users is counter-productive and we need to review it now. We need to pull the big levers and affect big change."" Many of those who died had taken a cocktail of heroin and pills They cross-party committee conducted what they called one of the most extensive inquiries ever carried out into problem drug use in Scotland. Their recommendations include the decriminalisation of drugs for personal use and new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilities. It said that if the UK government refused to change the law, the relevant powers should be devolved to Scotland. The report also said the Scottish government must do more to ensure drug treatment services were properly funded and supported. The Daily Record has been campaigning for decriminalisation of drug use The UK government currently treats drugs as a criminal justice matter, but the Scottish MPs heard this approach was often counter-productive. They want the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use not to be a criminal matter. It would still be illegal to supply drugs and police resources should be concentrated on that, they said. The MPs, who also gathered evidence in Portugal and Canada, found that decriminalisation was a ""public health"" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment. They called for the Department for Health and Social Care to take over lead responsibility for drugs policy from the Home Office. It is three years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city, but the idea has been blocked by the Home Office. Sometimes dubbed ""fix rooms"", they would be the first of their kind in the UK, with the aim being to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special site would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. The committee report said there was overwhelming evidence that fix rooms reduced the health risks, but they were not a ""silver bullet"" for problem drug use. The MPs expressed ""deep regret"" that the Home Office had chosen to block the Glasgow plan and said the UK government's reasons for doing so were ""not convincing"". The MPs said that drugs legislation was reserved to Westminster, but the Scottish government could be doing more on the delivery of drug-related health treatment. The report said Scottish government decisions, such as cutting funding for Alcohol and Drug Partnerships, had made the situation worse. Health services for problem drug use in Scotland must be properly funded, they said. The Scottish government said it welcomed support for the introduction of a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow as part of efforts to reduce deaths there. A spokeswoman added: ""The outdated Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 should be amended to allow us to implement a range of public health focused responses, including the introduction of safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. ""We call on the incoming UK government to amend the Act or to devolve those powers to Scotland.""

'Great lady of the French Resistance' dies at 103,"Ms Lundy used her wartime experience to spread a message of peace Yvette Lundy, a well-known member of the French Resistance and a Nazi concentration camp survivor, has died at the age of 103. Authorities said she died on Sunday in the northern French town of Epernay. Ms Lundy supplied fake papers to Jewish families, men fleeing forced labour, and escaped prisoners of war during the Nazi occupation of France. In 2017, she was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, one of the highest civilian decorations in France. She also inspired a character in the 2009 French film Korkoro, which follows a Gypsy family under threat from the Nazis. Ms Lundy was remembered on Sunday for her work as a member of a resistance network known as the Possum Escape Line. ArsÃ¨ne Tchakarian: French Resistance fighter dies aged 101 Being black in Nazi Germany Mystery of the skeleton hijacked by Nazis and Soviets Starting in 1940, she supplied fake papers to people who were then hidden at her brother's farm. She was arrested in June 1944, when she was 28, and taken to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Ms Lundy spoke frankly about the dehumanisation she suffered there from the outset, when she was forced to strip in front of SS officers. ""The body is naked and the brain is suddenly in tatters. You're like a hole, a hole full of emptiness, and if you look around it's more emptiness,"" she said. The former school teacher was later transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp, which was liberated in April 1945. She remained silent about her experiences for almost 15 years. But in 1959, Ms Lundy began sharing her testimony with French and German students, promoting a message of reconciliation. ""Still today, I think of the camp at one point each day... often at night before I fall asleep,"" she told AFP news agency in 2017. Mayor of Epernay Franck Leroy paid tribute to Ms Lundy on social media on Sunday, calling her ""an example for all of us."" She ""represented the honour of France during the darkest hours of our history,"" he wrote. Eric Girardin, a deputy in the French National Assembly, tweeted that he ""learned with sadness of the passing of Yvette Lundy, great lady of the Resistance.""

"Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US firms?","The starting gun has been fired, the election campaign is under way and the future of the NHS has dominated the opening lap of the contest.  If the early exchanges are anything to go by, health will feature prominently in the campaign. Labour has for some time argued that the NHS is vulnerable to privatisation under the Conservatives. The party has developed a new attack line, that any post-Brexit trade deal with the United States will open the door to big American health corporations.  It has also picked up on suggestions that the US authorities will demand that the NHS pays more for drugs supplied by American companies. In essence, Labour is alleging that the NHS is not safe after a Brexit presided over by the Tories. The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"".  They argue that there will be red lines with the British position in any trade talks, which protect the current status of the health service and the drug purchasing regime. Fuelling this row was adocumentary by Channel 4 Dispatches,externalwhich asserted that the price the NHS pays for US medicines could rise steeply in any future trade deal with the United States. The programme reported that ""drug pricing"" had been discussed in six initial meetings between trade officials from the UK and the US and that there had been ""secret meetings"" between the pharmaceutical companies and British civil servants. In response to the programme, the government said: ""We could not agree to any proposals on medicines pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice."" President Trump has made no secret of his frustration that US drug corporations can in many cases charge American health providers more for their products than what the NHS pays. This is because the US health system is market-based, and insurers are more ready to pay the asking price. Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? US firms seek changes to UK standards on beef and drugs Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US? Is Trump right that US drug prices have fallen? The NHS in England relies on the advice of the medical cost watchdog NICE, on what offers the best benefits for patients balanced against value for money. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to follow NICE rulings, while Scotland has its own equivalent, the SMC. The NICE regime, introduced 20 years ago, is seen as a great success in helping the NHS strike realistic pricing deals. A recent deal for the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi was hailed by health leaders in England as a big win for the system, with the American manufacturer Vertex, having initially refused to bring down its price, eventually signing up. The Scottish Government had already done its own deal. The NHS has immense bargaining power because of its size and its centralised control over drug availability is always attractive to pharmaceutical companies who are keen to be part of that market. So the suggestion in some quarters is that the American negotiators will demand that higher prices are paid to US pharmaceutical companies, potentially adding damaging extra costs to the already stretched NHS budget. The response by the Conservatives is that no British government would knowingly agree to something which added billions of pounds to public spending. So what about private provision in the NHS? There is evidence that the number of contracts awarded to private organisations by NHS commissioners has increased. But these have tended to be for smaller service deals, and a more rounded picture is gained by looking at the overall spending numbers. The proportion of government health spending in England going to private providers has risen by more than three-quarters in the last decade and now stands at 7.3%, according to official figures for 2018/19. But that rate has remained little changed for the last few years. Labour says this is evidence of creeping gains made by the private sector winning NHS  contracts. The Conservative response is that private provision also rose rapidly under the last Labour government, which outsourced some routine surgery to private hospitals. Current rules allow American and other foreign firms to bid for NHS contracts if they have a European subsidiary. The US company United Health owns Optum, for example, which provides IT and research services to some NHS organisations. It is conceivable that in any trade talks, US negotiators would demand a more streamlined bidding process to open up access.  It should be noted, however, that the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for an end to any competitive tendering. When Mr Trump visited the UK in June, he said the NHSwould form part of negotiations over a possible future trade deal between the UK and US. The next day,he rowed back from those remarks. When asked in his radio interview with LBC, whether the NHS would feature in trade talks, President Trump said: ""We wouldn't even be involved in that, no. It's not for us to have anything to do with your health care system."" The Conservatives argue that it simply would not be on the table. But it is impossible to be certain at this stage what precisely would or would not be in the mix when the negotiators get to work after Brexit.

"Don't use NHS as 'political weapon', say bosses","This video can not be played NHS Providers chief warns politicians against ""weaponising"" the health service Parties should not use the NHS as ""a political weapon"" in the election campaign, health service bosses say. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson said ""over-dramatising NHS difficulties"" or making ""disingenuous"" funding claims did the service ""no favours"". Both the Tories and Labour are vowing to spend billions to improve care. But Mr Hopson, who acts for health trust leaders in England, urged parties not to make ""empty promises"" or create ""unrealistic expectations"". The long-term future of the NHS and social care is likely to be a key battleground in the run-up to the 12 December election. The Tories are expected to trumpet extra spendingon the health service in England, including a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years and Â£100m for a further 34 hospitals to start developing future projects. This is on top of an extra Â£20bn in funding agreed by Theresa May's government up to 2023. Could the NHS be 'up for sale' to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked A really simple guide to the election,external How much does a general election cost? Labour argues the NHS is reeling from the tightest funding squeeze in modern history since 2010, which it says has left nearly four and half million people waiting for treatment and seen thousands of cancelled operations last year. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will end austerity in the NHS via a ""proper funding settlement"", with the exact details to be announced ahead of the launch of the party's manifesto. Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, mature, evidence-based"" debate on what the NHS needs. ""Let's not resort to the cheap political slogans and skimming across the top which is what we've seen over the last four or five elections,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Writing on the Times website,,externalhe said it was understandable that during election campaigns politicians should ""cast themselves as champions and defenders of the NHS"". However, he warned ""it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon"" - something he said leaders in the health service were worried was already starting to happen in this campaign. It is unrealistic to expect the parties to dial down their highly-charged debates on the subject. But NHS Providers argues that already things are getting out of hand with signs that the NHS is being ""weaponised"". Underlying all this is a warning that the NHS in England cannot seem to keep up with growing demand for care, which is ""particularly worrying"" with winter looming. Hospital chiefs are known to be concerned that there was intense pressure in recent weeks before winter had really set in. How that pressure develops before polling day could be a major issue in this campaign. While there were areas where ""the NHS is falling short"", he said ""over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients"". And Carrie MacEwen, from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said undeliverable promises ""simply set up the NHS to fail"". ""The NHS's role is to manage the health of the nation, not to be used as a tool to swing voters in a three-way marginal,"" she told the Times. ""Our fear is in these febrile times we will see irrational, undeliverable promises or even outright lies."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agreed that the NHS ""shouldn't be weaponised"" during the election campaign but voters deserved an ""honest debate about it."" Speaking after a visit to Unison headquarters to meet NHS staff, he also repeated that under a Labour government, the health service would be ""brought back in house"" when privatised contracts ""come to an end"". Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliament Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The Tories have repudiated Labour claims that privatisation has exploded in recent years, pointing to figures showing the total number of private contracts has remained static at 7% in the past four years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock accused Labour of peddling ""scare stories"" to try and win votes because they have ""nothing positive to offer"". ""These stories worry some of the most vulnerable people in the country, who the Labour Party used to say they represented,"" he said in a video message on Twitter. ""It is only with the Conservatives, with our strong support for the economy, that we can make sure the health service is always there for you and your family."" But former Conservative health secretary Stephen Dorrell, who is standing as a Lib Dem candidate in the election, said both the main parties were driven by ideology when it came to the issue. The NHS, he told the BBC Radio 4's World at One, was a ""perfect example of a place where our economy works best when the public and private work together"".

"Nigel Farage will not stand as election candidateThe Brexit Party leader believes he can ""serve the cause better"" campaigning across the UK.Election 2019","This video can not be played Mr Farage last stood for election in South Thanet in 2015 Nigel Farage has said he will not be standing as a candidate in the general election on 12 December. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr he had thought ""very hard"" but had decided he could ""serve the cause better"" by supporting his party's 600 candidates ""across the UK"". ""I don't want to be in politics for the rest of my life,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Farage's decision was ""a bit weird"" given the Brexit Party hopes to stand in most places. The Labour leader said: ""It's obviously his decision. It's a bit weird to lead a political party that is apparently contesting all or most of the seats up in the election and he himself is not offering himself for election."" Mr Farage, who has stood unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times and currently sits in the European Parliament, alsoalso criticised the PM's Brexit deal.. The 55-year-old told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the deal agreed earlier this month was ""virtually worse that being in the EU"". ""If Boris Johnson was going for a genuine Brexit, we wouldn't need to fight against him in this election,"" he said. On Friday, theprime minister rejected an alliance with Mr Farage's Brexit Party, telling BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg doing deals with ""any other party... simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". A really simple guide to the election,external Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external Mr Farage had called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. He told the Marr show: ""I always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. ""I still hope and pray it happens but it doesn't look like it will."" Mr Johnson maintains that the only way out of the EU is to ""go with the deal we've got"". The prime minister told Sophy Ridge on Sky that he was ""deeply, deeply disappointed"" to miss the 31 October deadline to secure Brexit, calling it ""a matter of deep regret"". The PM had previously said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond Halloween. Mr Johnson told the programme that he was sorry, and took responsibility, for missing the date, but accused Parliament of failing to implement his deal. He also said Donald Trump was ""patently in error"" when the US president warned the government's Brexit deal would hamper a UK-US trade deal. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson's deal ""kills off any chance of genuine independence"". ""If Boris is determined to stick to this new EU treaty, then that is not Brexit,"" he said. By political correspondent Jessica Parker Political opponents of Nigel Farage will accuse him of running scared after he said he would not stand as a candidate in December's poll. They will suggest he's not going to run because he thinks he's not going to win. But the flip side is that rather than concentrating on one constituency where he personally might try to win, Mr Farage is making it clear he's going to try to make Boris Johnson's life pretty difficult. That's if this so-called Leave alliance doesn't happen - and it doesn't look like it will. The Brexit Party leader has made it clear he has no interest in getting on board with Mr Johnson's deal at all. It's likely Mr Farage will spend a lot of the campaign really criticising it, whereas the Tory party leader will say he's got an oven-ready deal to present and get through Parliament within weeks. Treasury minister Rishi Sunak hit back at the criticism of the deal, telling the Andrew Marr show: ""I campaigned for Leave, I spent a lot of time talking to my constituents and others across the North East and in Yorkshire - what do they want from Brexit? ""They want to end free movement and replace it with a points system, they want to end the fact that money keeps going to the EU year after year, they want to make sure we're in control of our laws, and also they want us to have an independent trade policy. These are all things the prime minister's deal delivers. ""What I would say to Nigel Farage is, sometimes in politics, as in life, you've got to take yes for an answer."" Also appearing on the programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested that a Labour government would seek to end privatised contracts in the NHS. He said that, as the contracts ran out, the work should be brought in-house, and that the public didn't want money ""being poured into the pockets of profiteers"". Pushed on whether an incoming Labour government would see the eradication of all privatisation in the NHS, Mr McDonnell said ""we'll see how those contracts run out."" The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is ""up for sale"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked Asked if Labour would scrap the expansion of Heathrow airport, Mr McDonnell said the party would make the decision based on a set of criteria covering the environmental, economic and social impact of the project. ""On the current criteria, we've said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn't qualify."" And on taxes, he said Labour would increase income tax for the top 5% of earners and raise corporation tax in order to pay for ""investments in schools and training"".

"Don't use NHS as 'political weapon' - NHS bossThe head of NHS providers urges politicians to avoid making ""empty promises"" over the health service.Election 2019","This video can not be played NHS Providers chief warns politicians against ""weaponising"" the health service Parties should not use the NHS as ""a political weapon"" in the election campaign, health service bosses say. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson said ""over-dramatising NHS difficulties"" or making ""disingenuous"" funding claims did the service ""no favours"". Both the Tories and Labour are vowing to spend billions to improve care. But Mr Hopson, who acts for health trust leaders in England, urged parties not to make ""empty promises"" or create ""unrealistic expectations"". The long-term future of the NHS and social care is likely to be a key battleground in the run-up to the 12 December election. The Tories are expected to trumpet extra spendingon the health service in England, including a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years and Â£100m for a further 34 hospitals to start developing future projects. This is on top of an extra Â£20bn in funding agreed by Theresa May's government up to 2023. Could the NHS be 'up for sale' to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked A really simple guide to the election,external How much does a general election cost? Labour argues the NHS is reeling from the tightest funding squeeze in modern history since 2010, which it says has left nearly four and half million people waiting for treatment and seen thousands of cancelled operations last year. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will end austerity in the NHS via a ""proper funding settlement"", with the exact details to be announced ahead of the launch of the party's manifesto. Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, mature, evidence-based"" debate on what the NHS needs. ""Let's not resort to the cheap political slogans and skimming across the top which is what we've seen over the last four or five elections,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Writing on the Times website,,externalhe said it was understandable that during election campaigns politicians should ""cast themselves as champions and defenders of the NHS"". However, he warned ""it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon"" - something he said leaders in the health service were worried was already starting to happen in this campaign. It is unrealistic to expect the parties to dial down their highly-charged debates on the subject. But NHS Providers argues that already things are getting out of hand with signs that the NHS is being ""weaponised"". Underlying all this is a warning that the NHS in England cannot seem to keep up with growing demand for care, which is ""particularly worrying"" with winter looming. Hospital chiefs are known to be concerned that there was intense pressure in recent weeks before winter had really set in. How that pressure develops before polling day could be a major issue in this campaign. While there were areas where ""the NHS is falling short"", he said ""over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients"". And Carrie MacEwen, from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said undeliverable promises ""simply set up the NHS to fail"". ""The NHS's role is to manage the health of the nation, not to be used as a tool to swing voters in a three-way marginal,"" she told the Times. ""Our fear is in these febrile times we will see irrational, undeliverable promises or even outright lies."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agreed that the NHS ""shouldn't be weaponised"" during the election campaign but voters deserved an ""honest debate about it."" Speaking after a visit to Unison headquarters to meet NHS staff, he also repeated that under a Labour government, the health service would be ""brought back in house"" when privatised contracts ""come to an end"". Public spending 'to rocket' in next parliament Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The Tories have repudiated Labour claims that privatisation has exploded in recent years, pointing to figures showing the total number of private contracts has remained static at 7% in the past four years. Health Secretary Matt Hancock accused Labour of peddling ""scare stories"" to try and win votes because they have ""nothing positive to offer"". ""These stories worry some of the most vulnerable people in the country, who the Labour Party used to say they represented,"" he said in a video message on Twitter. ""It is only with the Conservatives, with our strong support for the economy, that we can make sure the health service is always there for you and your family."" But former Conservative health secretary Stephen Dorrell, who is standing as a Lib Dem candidate in the election, said both the main parties were driven by ideology when it came to the issue. The NHS, he told the BBC Radio 4's World at One, was a ""perfect example of a place where our economy works best when the public and private work together"".

'Great lady of the French Resistance' dies at 103Schoolteacher Yvette Lundy was sent to a concentration camp for her role in the French Resistance.Europe,"Ms Lundy used her wartime experience to spread a message of peace Yvette Lundy, a well-known member of the French Resistance and a Nazi concentration camp survivor, has died at the age of 103. Authorities said she died on Sunday in the northern French town of Epernay. Ms Lundy supplied fake papers to Jewish families, men fleeing forced labour, and escaped prisoners of war during the Nazi occupation of France. In 2017, she was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, one of the highest civilian decorations in France. She also inspired a character in the 2009 French film Korkoro, which follows a Gypsy family under threat from the Nazis. Ms Lundy was remembered on Sunday for her work as a member of a resistance network known as the Possum Escape Line. ArsÃ¨ne Tchakarian: French Resistance fighter dies aged 101 Being black in Nazi Germany Mystery of the skeleton hijacked by Nazis and Soviets Starting in 1940, she supplied fake papers to people who were then hidden at her brother's farm. She was arrested in June 1944, when she was 28, and taken to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Ms Lundy spoke frankly about the dehumanisation she suffered there from the outset, when she was forced to strip in front of SS officers. ""The body is naked and the brain is suddenly in tatters. You're like a hole, a hole full of emptiness, and if you look around it's more emptiness,"" she said. The former school teacher was later transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp, which was liberated in April 1945. She remained silent about her experiences for almost 15 years. But in 1959, Ms Lundy began sharing her testimony with French and German students, promoting a message of reconciliation. ""Still today, I think of the camp at one point each day... often at night before I fall asleep,"" she told AFP news agency in 2017. Mayor of Epernay Franck Leroy paid tribute to Ms Lundy on social media on Sunday, calling her ""an example for all of us."" She ""represented the honour of France during the darkest hours of our history,"" he wrote. Eric Girardin, a deputy in the French National Assembly, tweeted that he ""learned with sadness of the passing of Yvette Lundy, great lady of the Resistance.""
