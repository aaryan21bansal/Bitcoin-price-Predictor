Man arrested at airport not French suspect,"The man was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Friday A man arrested at Glasgow Airport on suspicion of murdering his family eight years ago was detained by mistake. Identity checks have shown that the man is not Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, Police Scotland confirmed. The 58-year-old has been on the runsince his wife and four children were found buried at their home in Nante in 2011,external. The detained man was stopped at the airport after arriving on a flight from Paris. Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife and four children In a statement Police Scotland said: ""On Friday, 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow Airport following information provided to police. ""He was held in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities. ""Inquiries were undertaken to confirm the man's identity. ""Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France. ""The man has since been released."" Mr Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife AgnÃ¨s, 48, and his children, Arthur, 21, Thomas, 18, Anne, 16, and BenoÃ®t, 13, whose bodies, as well as those of the family's two dogs, were discovered buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes in 2011. The murders, known as the ""Nantes slaughter"", deeply shocked France at the time. French prosecutors previously said he killed his victims in a ""methodical execution"", firing two bullets from a silenced weapon at close range into their heads, before he rolled them in lime and buried them under cement. Mr Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children's private Catholic high school that he had been transferred to a job in Australia. And he also allegedly told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme. A large police operation was mounted in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery.

Ireland thrash Samoa to reach World Cup last eight,"Johnny Sexton scored two tries as Ireland secured a bonus point before half-time 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A: Ireland v Samoa Ireland (26) 47 Tries:Best, Furlong, Sexton 2, Larmour, Stander, ConwayCons:Sexton 4, Carbery 2 Samoa (5) 5 Try:J Lam Ireland booked their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a seven-try win over Samoa in Fukuoka. Ireland had to play over half the match with 14 men after Bundee Aki's 29th-minute dismissal, though tries by Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong and Johnny Sexton had already put them in control. Jack Lam replied but another Sexton try secured a bonus point before half-time. Jordan Larmour, CJ Stander and Andrew Conway also crossed as Ireland navigated the second half unscathed. Ireland's opponents in the last eight will be determined by the outcome of the final Pool A fixture between Japan and Scotland on Sunday, whichcould still be cancelled with Typhoon Hagibis wreaking havocin Yokohama. If that game does not go ahead, both sides would be awarded two points and Japan would top the group ahead of Ireland, leaving Joe Schmidt's side to face three-time champions New Zealand - winners of the past two World Cups - in Tokyo next Saturday. If it does go ahead, a Scotland victory without Japan claiming two losing bonus points would see Ireland finish top, with South Africa their quarter-final opponents. Aki upset by red card - Schmidt Ireland must scale new heights - Best World Cup permutations: Who needs what to reach quarter-finals? Bundee Aki became the first Ireland player to be red-carded in a World Cup match Knowing a five-point win would assure their progress regardless of events in Yokohama, Ireland began purposefully, with the decision to kick for the corner as opposed to taking an easy three points paying off twice in the first nine minutes. Captain Best drove over from a rolling maul, before the destructive Furlong broke through four would-be tacklers to cross as Ireland made the most of Samoan indiscipline. Sexton's first try, after a slick break and offload from Larmour, put Ireland on the cusp of the bonus point with just a quarter of the game gone. However, two incidents in the space of five moments threatened to completely alter the direction of the contest. After Lam barrelled over the top of Ireland's defence to put Samoa on the board, centre Aki was dismissed for a tackle direct to the head of fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. Samoa's momentum was short-lived as they failed to translate their numerical superiority into any sort of meaningful advantage. Sexton's show and go off the back of a scrum just before the interval saw Ireland enter the break with the job done, ensuring there was little in the way of tension when the players re-emerged from the tunnel. Larmour's was the silkiest footwork on display and he will be pushing for a quarter-final start In a satisfactory evening for Ireland, several loose passes and handling errors that contributed to some of their hairiest moments in the first half will come under the microscope with the All Blacks or the Springboks looming on the horizon. Attention will now turn to team selection for Ireland's biggest game since the last eight in 2015. While in truth there is a clear first-choice player in most positions, Leinster full-back Larmour put in a performance that may just persuade Schmidt to stick with the 22-year-old next week. An accusation that has been made against this Ireland team in recent times is that they are one-dimensional in attack. Against Samoa, Larmour was a constant and unpredictable threat with ball in hand as he sought to jink through the opposition defence at every opportunity. His probing paid off for Sexton's opening try and he was rewarded with a score of his own nine minutes after the break, latching onto Conor Murray's perfect flat pass. In Rob Kearney, Schmidt has a player who has delivered in most of Ireland's biggest games over the past decade, however Larmour's impressive outings against Scotland and Samoa will certainly have given the head coach food for thought. Johnny Sexton scored 18 points in the game, the most he has scored in a World Cup game Concerns over the condition of the pitch at the Hakatanomori Stadium rose to the surface during Friday's captain's run, during which Irish players were able to lift up the turf enough to fit a rugby ball underneath. Mercifully, the injuries that many thought inevitable on such a track did not materialise, and in general the pitch held up well for the 80 minutes. With the game being played totally on their terms in the second half, Ireland removed Sexton and Conor Murray, who once again displayed their importance to the side in two perfectly-controlled displays. The game situation also allowed Schmidt to give second-choice fly-half Joey Carbery some vital minutes to make an impression, with the Munster man having played just 20 minutes in the previous three games. After Stander powered over following sustained Irish pressure inside the Samoan five-metre line, it was Carbery's well-judged grubber kick that allowed Conway to put the finishing touches on a hugely satisfactory Irish display. Bundee Aki is the first player to be sent off for Ireland in a World Cup match, and the fourth to be sent off in any game for Ireland (Willie Duggan, Jamie Heaslip, CJ Stander). Samoa have now lost each of their last 11 games against Tier 1 opposition at the Rugby World Cup, their last such victory coming back in 1999 against Wales. There have now been seven red cards shown at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the previous highest at the tournament was four in both 1995 and 1999. This was the fifth time 14 men have beaten 15 in a Rugby World Cup match (excluding sin-binnings). Only Canada's 72-11 win against Namibia in 1999 has seen a bigger margin of victory (42 points) for the outnumbered side. This was just the fourth time Ireland have scored 4+ first-half tries in a Rugby World Cup match, five v Namibia 2003, five v Russia 2011, four v Canada in 2015.

Japan hit by biggest typhoon in decades,"Helicopters rescued people trapped in their homes when the Chikuma river burst its banks At least nine people are reported dead as Japan recovers from its biggest storm in decades. Typhoon Hagibis triggered floods and landslides as it battered the country with wind speeds of 225km/h (140mph). Rivers have breached their banks in at least 14 different places, inundating residential neighbourhoods. The storm led to some Rugby World Cup matches being cancelled but a key fixture between Japan and Scotland will go ahead on Sunday. Hagibis is heading north and is expected to move back into the North Pacific later on Sunday. In pictures: Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan It made landfall on Saturday shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT), in Izu Peninsula, south-west of Tokyo and moved up the east coast. Almost half a million homes were left without power. In the town of Hakone near Mount Fuji more than 1m (3ft) of rain fell on Friday and Saturday, the highest total ever recorded in Japan over 48 hours. This video can not be played More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes Further north in Nagano prefecture, levees along the Chikuma river gave way sending water rushing through residential areas, inundating houses. Flood defences around Tokyo have held and river levels are now falling, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Japan. Officials said some of those killed were swept away by landslides while others were trapped in their cars as floodwaters rose. Another 15 people are listed as missing and dozens are reported injured. More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes as the huge storm approached, but it is thought only 50,000 stayed in shelters. Many residents stocked up on provisions before the typhoon's arrival, leaving supermarkets with empty shelves. Torrential rain has caused rivers to flood huge areas A huge clean-up operation was under way in Kawasaki near Tokyo ""Unprecedented heavy rain has been seen in cities, towns and villages for which the emergency warning was issued,"" Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) forecaster Yasushi Kajiwara told a press briefing. Many bullet train services were halted, and several lines on the Tokyo metro were suspended for most of Saturday. All flights to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport and Narita airport in Chiba have been cancelled - more than 1,000 in total. Bullet trains were half submerged in Nagano, central Japan Two Rugby World Cup games scheduled for Saturday were cancelled on safety grounds and declared as draws - England-France and New Zealand-Italy. The cancellations were the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Sunday's Namibia-Canada match due to take place in Kamaishi was also cancelled and declared a draw. The US-Tonga fixture in Osaka and Wales-Uruguay in Kumamoto will go ahead as scheduled on Sunday, organisers said. Meanwhile, a crunch game between Scotland and tournament hosts Japan on Sunday will now go ahead. The decision followed a safety inspection. Scotland against Japan to go ahead The Japanese Formula One Grand Prix is also taking place on Sunday. Vettel in pole position for Japanese Grand Prix Local resident James Babb spoke to the BBC from an evacuation centre in Hachioji, western Tokyo. He said the river near his house was on the brink of overflowing. ""I am with my sister-in-law, who is disabled,"" he said. ""Our house may flood. They have given us a blanket and a biscuit."" Tornado-like winds whipped up by the typhoon struck east of Tokyo Andrew Higgins, an English teacher who lives in Tochigi, north of Tokyo, told the BBC he had ""lived through a few typhoons"" during seven years in Japan. ""I feel like this time Japan, generally, has taken this typhoon a lot more seriously,"" he said. ""People were out preparing last night. A lot of people were stocking up."" Only last month Typhoon Faxai wreaked havoc on parts of Japan, damaging 30,000 homes, most of which have not yet been repaired. ""I evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I'm so worried about my house,"" a 93-year-old man told NHK, from a shelter in Tateyama, Chiba. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Japan suffers about 20 typhoons a year, but Tokyo is rarely hit on this scale.

Diplomat's wife 'devastated' by Harry Dunn's death,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The US diplomat's wife granted immunity after the crash which killed teenager Harry Dunn is ""devastated by the tragic accident"", her lawyer has said. Anne Sacoolas's legal representative, Amy Jeffress, said she would ""continue to co-operate with the investigation"". Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left for the US under diplomatic immunity despite being a suspect in the crash with Mr Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire on 27 August. But the Foreign Office said, having gone home, she no longer has immunity. A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband worked at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, said: ""Anne is devastated by this tragic accident. ""No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn's family."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 It added she had ""fully co-operated with the police"". ""She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to co-operate with the investigation,"" the statement continued. ""Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident. ""We have been in contact with the family's attorneys and look forward to hearing from them."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family on Saturday to explain both the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas' immunity irrelevant. The letter said: ""We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter. ""We have looked at this very carefully... the UK government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas's case, because she has returned home. ""The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent."" Radd Seiger (centre) has travelled to the US ahead of Harry Dunn's parents In response to the letter, Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We've known from the start that the ""extra"" feeling in the pit of our tummies, told us that something wasn't right. ""We're proud of ourselves for fighting for justice for Harry, and not ignoring this gnawing within our bodies. ""We'd rather have our beautiful boy back, but we are also elated that all this fighting for justice for Harry has not been in vain. This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" ""We'll continue to fight for change to the diplomatic immunity laws and any other positive changes we can achieve."" Mark Stephens, a lawyer for the Dunn family said: ""She was allowed to, or encouraged to be spirited away on an American transport plane and effectively rendered a fugitive from British justice. ""And now of course we find out that she's not entitled to diplomatic immunity, and in those circumstances she is in a foreign land a fugitive from British justice. ""We do hope she returns herself voluntarily and that this was just a bad piece of advice she received from the American authorities."" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more on the Harry Dunn crash Earlier, the lawyer for Mr Dunn's family, Radd Seiger, appealed for anyone with information about Mrs Sacoolas's return to the United States to come forward. Mr Dunn's parents, who have previously said they are considering civil action against Mrs Sacoolas, are set to fly out to the US on Sunday and will visit both New York and Washington DC. Mr Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". Harry Dunn's Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in August On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the US was ""absolutely ruthless"" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity. He said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family's views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US was ""very reluctant"" to allow citizens to be tried abroad. That followed the revelation that Mrs Sacoolas would not return to the UK when briefing notes held by Mr Trumpwere photographed at a White House news conference. Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley has said the investigation into the crash will continue. The force has said CCTV of the crash in which Mr Dunn died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.

'Intense' Brexit talks between UK and EU,"Negotiators from the UK and EU are having what has been described as ""intense technical discussions"" in an attempt to agree a new Brexit deal. About a dozen British officials, including the UK's EU adviser David Frost, are taking part in the talks at the EU Commission in Brussels. The meetings are expected to continue through the weekend. But European Council President Donald Tusk has suggested there is only the slightest chance of an agreement. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and a European leaders' summit next Thursday and Friday is seen as the last chance to agree a deal before that deadline. UK Europe adviser David Frost is involved in the talks Prime Minister Boris Johnson'srevised proposals- designed to avoid concerns about hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - were criticised by EU leaders at the start of last week. However, on Thursday, Mr Johnson and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar held talks and said they could""see a pathway to a possible deal"". Brexit: EU and UK agree to 'intensify' talks Pound surges on Brexit deal hopes DUP: NI must stay in UK customs union after Brexit BBC Europe reporter Gavin Lee said there is no scheduled timetable for the discussions in Brussels and neither the UK or EU are offering any detail yet on the apparent common ground that has been found on the Irish border. Our correspondent said the first public announcement on the talks may come on Monday, after the EU's 27 ambassadors have been updated on the progress so far. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar held talks on Thursday in Thornton Manor, in the Wirral Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour would take action through the courts if Mr Johnson tries to push through a no-deal Brexit. Addressing the Co-operative Party conference in Glasgow, Sir Keir said if the PM did not secure a deal at the EU summit on 17 and 18 October, he must comply with the so-calledBenn Act passed by MPs in September,which requires him to seek a further delay. ""If he doesn't, we'll enforce the law - in the courts and in Parliament. Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit,"" he said. This weekend's talks in Brussels follow a meeting on Friday between Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, described by both sides as ""constructive"". In a statement issued later, the European Commission said: ""The EU and the UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan reiterated that ""lots of details"" needed to be worked out between both parties but said the ""mood music"" on negotiations ""seems positive"". She added that ""speculation doesn't really help"" and politicians needed to ""stand back and give those negotiations and discussions the best chance of succeeding"". Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said ""speculation doesn't really help"" On Friday, Mr Tusksaid he had received ""promising signals"" from the Irish PM,before adding: ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used"". Mr Johnson also acknowledged there was not ""a done deal"", saying: ""The best thing we can do now is let our negotiators get on with it."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Brexit is not a done deal Support from Democratic Unionist Party MPs could be crucial to get a deal through Parliament. But DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""Anything that traps Northern Ireland in the EU... will not have our support."" Brexiteer Sir John Redwood believes Mr Johnson should ""table a free trade agreement"" which would ""unlock"" most of the issues around borders and immigration. He added: ""I think the border issue is greatly exaggerated, because it is in the interest of the European Union and Ireland to exaggerate it."" Ms Morgan was asked on the Today programme about reports of Downing Street briefings that the Tories could contest a general election on a no-deal Brexit ticket, if an agreement cannot be reached. The Loughborough MP - who voted Remain - did not say whether she would contest an election on such a ticket, but said reports that Mr Johnson is preparing to fight a general election on a no deal platform are ""wide of the mark"".

'Witnesses' appeal over crash diplomat's US return,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The lawyer for the family of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash has appealed for ""witnesses"" to the suspect's return to the United States. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, left the UK despite being a suspect in the fatal crash with Harry Dunn, 19, on 27 August. The US government has not waived Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. Lawyer Radd Seiger asked for those with information ""before, during, or after her departure"" to come forward. Mr Dunn's parents, who have previously said they areconsidering civil actionagainst Mrs Sacoolas, are set to fly out to the US on Sunday and will visit both New York and Washington DC. Mr Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said his administration would speak to Mrs Sacoolas ""very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet"". This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" But a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference appeared to suggest Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UKafter being granted diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". His father Tim Dunn said: ""We have to go to America and speak to the American people. We can't let this be swept under the carpet."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Radd Seiger (centre) has invited President Trump to meet Harry Dunn's parents The family met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday, which they have since described as a ""publicity stunt"". Afterwards Mr Raab said the justice process was ""not being allowed to properly run its course"". Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley said the investigation into the crash was ""carrying on"" and that a file would be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service soon. Mr Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton in Northamptonshire, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan had been working. Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.

Man arrested at airport not French suspectThe man was arrested on a European Arrest warrant after reportedly boarding a flight from Paris to Glasgow.Glasgow & West Scotland,"The man was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Friday A man arrested at Glasgow Airport on suspicion of murdering his family eight years ago was detained by mistake. Identity checks have shown that the man is not Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, Police Scotland confirmed. The 58-year-old has been on the runsince his wife and four children were found buried at their home in Nante in 2011,external. The detained man was stopped at the airport after arriving on a flight from Paris. Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife and four children In a statement Police Scotland said: ""On Friday, 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow Airport following information provided to police. ""He was held in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities. ""Inquiries were undertaken to confirm the man's identity. ""Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France. ""The man has since been released."" Mr Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife AgnÃ¨s, 48, and his children, Arthur, 21, Thomas, 18, Anne, 16, and BenoÃ®t, 13, whose bodies, as well as those of the family's two dogs, were discovered buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes in 2011. The murders, known as the ""Nantes slaughter"", deeply shocked France at the time. French prosecutors previously said he killed his victims in a ""methodical execution"", firing two bullets from a silenced weapon at close range into their heads, before he rolled them in lime and buried them under cement. Mr Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children's private Catholic high school that he had been transferred to a job in Australia. And he also allegedly told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme.

Wife's 'awful' journey to husband's assisted death,"Five weeks on from her husband's death at a Swiss euthanasia clinic, Elaine Selley says parts of the experience were ""awful"" The wife of a former teacher who ended his life at a Swiss euthanasia clinic last month has said much of the experience was ""awful"". Elaine Selley's husband Richard battled motor neurone disease (MND) for four years and ended his life at Dignitas in Zurich on 6 September. He had campaigned for euthanasia laws to be introduced in Scotland. Mrs Selley said she believed he made the right choice but having to travel abroad made it much harder to bear. Speaking for the first time since his death, she toldBBC Scotland's The Nine: ""I think you are numb and you are in shock and I think there are moments where I think it happened yesterday and there are moments when I think it has happened to somebody in a different life. ""I think that experience now is part of my experience in life and I have to process and deal with that and it will be with me forever."" Why can't I die with dignity at home? What is assisted suicide and euthanasia? Richard Selley and his wife Elaine made his final journey to Switzerland in September Mrs Selley said that the reality of leaving Scotland and their loved ones behind to make that final journey to Zurich was brutal, especially seeing their children for the last time at the airport. She said: ""It was having to say goodbye to people you loved at the airport surrounded by everybody on their way to Spain and Portugal on their holidays. It was awful. ""We were sitting reading these really comforting, beautiful emails we were being sent and there were a few tears shed when we were reading them, when we were sitting with everybody else in the departure lounge. "" This video can not be played Richard Selley spoke to the BBC about his decision to end his life Richard Selley campaigned for a change to laws on assisted dying right up until his death in September. In Julyhe wrote an open letter to MSPs calling for reform,external. He wrote a blog and a book on the issue and made videos on the emotive subject, the last being shared in the week he travelled to Switzerland to end his life. The 65-year-old said that having to be able to fly meant he chose to die earlier than he would otherwise have wanted. He said that if an assisted death was possible in Scotland, he would have been able to die at a time of his choosing, at home. He said: ""I hope that members of the Scottish Parliament support an assisted dying bill in the future. ""I think the momentum for a change in the law is growing."" Mrs Selley travelled with Richard and his brother Peter from their home in Glenalmond, near Perth. They spent two days in a hotel before they set foot in the clinic itself. Away from his home support, she said Richard was vulnerable, and in pain and distress. Mrs Selley said it was an upsetting experience but that watching him in that final 48 hours made her realise how sick he was and that he had ""taken it to the wire"". Five weeks ago, at 12:40 on 6 September, Richard took his own life. His wife believes he made the right decision and she will continue Richard's campaign to make euthanasia legal in Scotland. She said: ""We wish we weren't there and we didn't have to go through this. ""But for Richard and for his pain and his distress in that moment in time, which was far worse than it was at home, we knew he was doing the right thing for him. ""He really had had enough and wanted out of it and although we didn't want to lose him, didn't want it to happen and it was scary, it was the right thing for him."" Opponents of assisted dying legislation argue that introducing such a law in Scotland risks exposing people to abuse, coercion and exploitation. Richard and Elaine Selley had to make plans for the final trip to Dignitas Mrs Selley disagrees: ""Some people are quite happy to let nature take its course but Richard wanted to take charge of his end of life experience, to ensure it was peaceful and he wasn't in any pain. And I can't see any opposing argument to that if there are safeguards in place. ""These are terminally ill people in the last phase of their life who have no chance of being cured, and there is nothing that can be done, why shouldn't they make a choice?"" Previousbids to introduce new legislation have failed to get through the Scottish Parliament. Attempts to change the law on assisted dying issue were made by the MSP Margo MacDonald, who died in April 2014 after a long fight against Parkinson's. The idea was put before Holyrood twice, but her bills failed to receive parliamentary backing. Euthanasia campaigner dies at Swiss clinic 'Why can't I die with dignity at home?'

Plastic-stemmed cotton buds now banned in Scotland,"Johnson and Johnson's iconic blue cotton bud stems are no longer made from plastic New laws have come into force in Scotland banning the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds. The move follows concerns about the number ofbuds washing up on beachesafter being flushed down toilets. Most major retailers switched to paper-stemmed buds in the months leading up to the ban following a campaign. A similar ban - also including plastic coffee stirrers and straws - comes into force in the rest of the UK next year. Cotton buds are consistently listed in the top 10 forms of beach litter by the Marine Conservation Society. Thousands of plastic-stemmed buds have washed up on beaches around Scotland Across the UK, about 1.8 billion of them are sold every year. In 2017, the pharmaceutical firm Johnson and Johnson became the first major manufacturer to switch away from plastic. All the major supermarkets have followed suit by either switching to biodegradable paper or committing to doing so. Waitrose is estimated to have saved 21 tonnes of plastic through the policy. Scottish environmental charity Fidra and its volunteers have been at the forefront of working with the industry to promote biodegradable alternatives. Fidra's Heather McFarlane says the buds are particularly harmful to wildlife It praised the Scottish law change as ""great news"" for wildlife and the environment. The charity's project manager Heather McFarlane said: ""Now we are seeing this ban come into place, that will pick up those last few retailers and manufacturers who haven't made the switch from plastic to paper. ""The plastic cotton bids have been washing up on beaches for years and they get into the environment in quite high numbers. ""They are particularly damaging to wildlife. They have been found in our native bird populations and in the intestines of turtles. You can just imagine the damage that can do."" WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ""Cotton buds are some of the most pervasive forms of marine pollution, so a ban is very welcome step and one that we hope other countries will follow. ""We know plastic is suffocating our seas and devastating our wildlife with millions of birds, fish and mammals dying each year because of the plastic in our oceans. ""Plastics are also finding their way into the food we eat and the water we drink, so saving our oceans will require further ambitious action from governments, industry and consumers.""

People praised for 'intervening' in Arndale attack,"A man was apprehended by police after an attack at the Manchester Arndale A Manchester Arndale worker and a member of the public have been praised for helping to stop a stabbing in which three people were hurt. A man""lunged"" at people in the shopping centreon Friday and attacked a 19-year-old woman, a man, 59, and another woman, who are in hospital. Two others were hurt, but none of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening. A 40-year-old man has been detained under the Mental Health Act. Witnesses said people were ""screaming and running"" as they evacuated the centre after a man started to attack shoppers with a large knife. A police spokesman said the 19-year-old woman required surgery after being stabbed in her arm, while the 59-year-old man suffered stab wounds to his hand. As it happened: Manchester Arndale stabbings,external Forensic officers conduct investigations outside the shopping centre Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""We know that at least one member of staff from the Arndale and a member of the public intervened in the attack and we would like to praise and thank them for their bravery."" At a press conference earlier, police revealed they had searched a property in the city where the arrested man lived. Officers said they were trying to establish if he had any political, religious or ideological motivation for the attack, although nothing has so far has come to light. He was initially held on suspicion of assault then re-arrested on suspicion of terror offences before he was detained under the Mental Health Act. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said officials were keeping an ""open mind"". ""It's important not to jump to any conclusions although what I can say is that, at this stage, it would appear to be more mental-health related than political or religiously motivated."" He said the attack appeared to be ""an isolated incident"" and urged people to ""go about their weekend"" as they had planned. Staff were allowed back into the centre on Friday afternoon The shopping centre, which is close to the arena where a terror attack killed 22 people in 2017, re-opened for business on Saturday. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said: ""Every time we have had an incident of this sort in the city, Manchester shows its resilience, its ability to come together and its determination to get on with business - to get on with life - and that's what we see today.""

"Brexit talks 'mood music' positive, minister says","Negotiators from the UK and EU are having what has been described as ""intense technical discussions"" in an attempt to agree a new Brexit deal. About a dozen British officials, including the UK's EU adviser David Frost, are taking part in the talks at the EU Commission in Brussels. The meetings are expected to continue through the weekend. But European Council President Donald Tusk has suggested there is only the slightest chance of an agreement. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and a European leaders' summit next Thursday and Friday is seen as the last chance to agree a deal before that deadline. UK Europe adviser David Frost is involved in the talks Prime Minister Boris Johnson'srevised proposals- designed to avoid concerns about hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - were criticised by EU leaders at the start of last week. However, on Thursday, Mr Johnson and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar held talks and said they could""see a pathway to a possible deal"". Brexit: EU and UK agree to 'intensify' talks Pound surges on Brexit deal hopes DUP: NI must stay in UK customs union after Brexit BBC Europe reporter Gavin Lee said there is no scheduled timetable for the discussions in Brussels and neither the UK or EU are offering any detail yet on the apparent common ground that has been found on the Irish border. Our correspondent said the first public announcement on the talks may come on Monday, after the EU's 27 ambassadors have been updated on the progress so far. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar held talks on Thursday in Thornton Manor, in the Wirral Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour would take action through the courts if Mr Johnson tries to push through a no-deal Brexit. Addressing the Co-operative Party conference in Glasgow, Sir Keir said if the PM did not secure a deal at the EU summit on 17 and 18 October, he must comply with the so-calledBenn Act passed by MPs in September,which requires him to seek a further delay. ""If he doesn't, we'll enforce the law - in the courts and in Parliament. Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit,"" he said. This weekend's talks in Brussels follow a meeting on Friday between Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, described by both sides as ""constructive"". In a statement issued later, the European Commission said: ""The EU and the UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan reiterated that ""lots of details"" needed to be worked out between both parties but said the ""mood music"" on negotiations ""seems positive"". She added that ""speculation doesn't really help"" and politicians needed to ""stand back and give those negotiations and discussions the best chance of succeeding"". Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said ""speculation doesn't really help"" On Friday, Mr Tusksaid he had received ""promising signals"" from the Irish PM,before adding: ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used"". Mr Johnson also acknowledged there was not ""a done deal"", saying: ""The best thing we can do now is let our negotiators get on with it.""

But DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""Anything that traps Northern Ireland in the EU... will not have our support."" Brexiteer Sir John Redwood believes Mr Johnson should ""table a free trade agreement"" which would ""unlock"" most of the issues around borders and immigration. He added: ""I think the border issue is greatly exaggerated, because it is in the interest of the European Union and Ireland to exaggerate it."" Ms Morgan was asked on the Today programme about reports of Downing Street briefings that the Tories could contest a general election on a no-deal Brexit ticket, if an agreement cannot be reached. The Loughborough MP - who voted Remain - did not say whether she would contest an election on such a ticket, but said reports that Mr Johnson is preparing to fight a general election on a no deal platform are ""wide of the mark"".

'Witnesses' appeal over crash diplomat's US returnThe family of Harry Dunn are to travel to the US on Sunday to speak with the media and politicians.Northampton,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The lawyer for the family of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash has appealed for ""witnesses"" to the suspect's return to the United States. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, left the UK despite being a suspect in the fatal crash with Harry Dunn, 19, on 27 August. The US government has not waived Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. Lawyer Radd Seiger asked for those with information ""before, during, or after her departure"" to come forward. Mr Dunn's parents, who have previously said they areconsidering civil actionagainst Mrs Sacoolas, are set to fly out to the US on Sunday and will visit both New York and Washington DC. Mr Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said his administration would speak to Mrs Sacoolas ""very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet"". This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" But a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference appeared to suggest Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UKafter being granted diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". His father Tim Dunn said: ""We have to go to America and speak to the American people. We can't let this be swept under the carpet."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Radd Seiger (centre) has invited President Trump to meet Harry Dunn's parents The family met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday, which they have since described as a ""publicity stunt"". Afterwards Mr Raab said the justice process was ""not being allowed to properly run its course"". Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley said the investigation into the crash was ""carrying on"" and that a file would be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service soon. Mr Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton in Northamptonshire, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan had been working.

Ireland thrash Samoa to reach World Cup last eightIreland are through to the World Cup quarter-finals after beating Samoa 47-5 in their Pool A match in Fukuoka.BBC SportComments,"Johnny Sexton scored two tries as Ireland secured a bonus point before half-time 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A: Ireland v Samoa Ireland (26) 47 Tries:Best, Furlong, Sexton 2, Larmour, Stander, ConwayCons:Sexton 4, Carbery 2 Samoa (5) 5 Try:J Lam Ireland booked their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a seven-try win over Samoa in Fukuoka. Ireland had to play over half the match with 14 men after Bundee Aki's 29th-minute dismissal, though tries by Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong and Johnny Sexton had already put them in control. Jack Lam replied but another Sexton try secured a bonus point before half-time. Jordan Larmour, CJ Stander and Andrew Conway also crossed as Ireland navigated the second half unscathed. Ireland's opponents in the last eight will be determined by the outcome of the final Pool A fixture between Japan and Scotland on Sunday, whichcould still be cancelled with Typhoon Hagibis wreaking havocin Yokohama. If that game does not go ahead, both sides would be awarded two points and Japan would top the group ahead of Ireland, leaving Joe Schmidt's side to face three-time champions New Zealand - winners of the past two World Cups - in Tokyo next Saturday. If it does go ahead, a Scotland victory without Japan claiming two losing bonus points would see Ireland finish top, with South Africa their quarter-final opponents. Aki upset by red card - Schmidt Ireland must scale new heights - Best World Cup permutations: Who needs what to reach quarter-finals? Bundee Aki became the first Ireland player to be red-carded in a World Cup match Knowing a five-point win would assure their progress regardless of events in Yokohama, Ireland began purposefully, with the decision to kick for the corner as opposed to taking an easy three points paying off twice in the first nine minutes. Captain Best drove over from a rolling maul, before the destructive Furlong broke through four would-be tacklers to cross as Ireland made the most of Samoan indiscipline. Sexton's first try, after a slick break and offload from Larmour, put Ireland on the cusp of the bonus point with just a quarter of the game gone. However, two incidents in the space of five moments threatened to completely alter the direction of the contest. After Lam barrelled over the top of Ireland's defence to put Samoa on the board, centre Aki was dismissed for a tackle direct to the head of fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. Samoa's momentum was short-lived as they failed to translate their numerical superiority into any sort of meaningful advantage. Sexton's show and go off the back of a scrum just before the interval saw Ireland enter the break with the job done, ensuring there was little in the way of tension when the players re-emerged from the tunnel. Larmour's was the silkiest footwork on display and he will be pushing for a quarter-final start In a satisfactory evening for Ireland, several loose passes and handling errors that contributed to some of their hairiest moments in the first half will come under the microscope with the All Blacks or the Springboks looming on the horizon. Attention will now turn to team selection for Ireland's biggest game since the last eight in 2015. While in truth there is a clear first-choice player in most positions, Leinster full-back Larmour put in a performance that may just persuade Schmidt to stick with the 22-year-old next week. An accusation that has been made against this Ireland team in recent times is that they are one-dimensional in attack. Against Samoa, Larmour was a constant and unpredictable threat with ball in hand as he sought to jink through the opposition defence at every opportunity. His probing paid off for Sexton's opening try and he was rewarded with a score of his own nine minutes after the break, latching onto Conor Murray's perfect flat pass. In Rob Kearney, Schmidt has a player who has delivered in most of Ireland's biggest games over the past decade, however Larmour's impressive outings against Scotland and Samoa will certainly have given the head coach food for thought. Johnny Sexton scored 18 points in the game, the most he has scored in a World Cup game Concerns over the condition of the pitch at the Hakatanomori Stadium rose to the surface during Friday's captain's run, during which Irish players were able to lift up the turf enough to fit a rugby ball underneath. Mercifully, the injuries that many thought inevitable on such a track did not materialise, and in general the pitch held up well for the 80 minutes. With the game being played totally on their terms in the second half, Ireland removed Sexton and Conor Murray, who once again displayed their importance to the side in two perfectly-controlled displays. The game situation also allowed Schmidt to give second-choice fly-half Joey Carbery some vital minutes to make an impression, with the Munster man having played just 20 minutes in the previous three games. After Stander powered over following sustained Irish pressure inside the Samoan five-metre line, it was Carbery's well-judged grubber kick that allowed Conway to put the finishing touches on a hugely satisfactory Irish display. Bundee Aki is the first player to be sent off for Ireland in a World Cup match, and the fourth to be sent off in any game for Ireland (Willie Duggan, Jamie Heaslip, CJ Stander). Samoa have now lost each of their last 11 games against Tier 1 opposition at the Rugby World Cup, their last such victory coming back in 1999 against Wales. There have now been seven red cards shown at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the previous highest at the tournament was four in both 1995 and 1999. This was the fifth time 14 men have beaten 15 in a Rugby World Cup match (excluding sin-binnings). Only Canada's 72-11 win against Namibia in 1999 has seen a bigger margin of victory (42 points) for the outnumbered side. This was just the fourth time Ireland have scored 4+ first-half tries in a Rugby World Cup match, five v Namibia 2003, five v Russia 2011, four v Canada in 2015.

"Brexit talks 'mood music' positive, minister saysCulture Secretary Nicky Morgan said politicians needed to give negotiations ""the chance of succeeding"".","Negotiators from the UK and EU are having what has been described as ""intense technical discussions"" in an attempt to agree a new Brexit deal. About a dozen British officials, including the UK's EU adviser David Frost, are taking part in the talks at the EU Commission in Brussels. The meetings are expected to continue through the weekend. But European Council President Donald Tusk has suggested there is only the slightest chance of an agreement. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and a European leaders' summit next Thursday and Friday is seen as the last chance to agree a deal before that deadline. UK Europe adviser David Frost is involved in the talks Prime Minister Boris Johnson'srevised proposals- designed to avoid concerns about hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - were criticised by EU leaders at the start of last week. However, on Thursday, Mr Johnson and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar held talks and said they could""see a pathway to a possible deal"". Brexit: EU and UK agree to 'intensify' talks Pound surges on Brexit deal hopes DUP: NI must stay in UK customs union after Brexit BBC Europe reporter Gavin Lee said there is no scheduled timetable for the discussions in Brussels and neither the UK or EU are offering any detail yet on the apparent common ground that has been found on the Irish border. Our correspondent said the first public announcement on the talks may come on Monday, after the EU's 27 ambassadors have been updated on the progress so far. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar held talks on Thursday in Thornton Manor, in the Wirral Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour would take action through the courts if Mr Johnson tries to push through a no-deal Brexit. Addressing the Co-operative Party conference in Glasgow, Sir Keir said if the PM did not secure a deal at the EU summit on 17 and 18 October, he must comply with the so-calledBenn Act passed by MPs in September,which requires him to seek a further delay. ""If he doesn't, we'll enforce the law - in the courts and in Parliament. Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit,"" he said. This weekend's talks in Brussels follow a meeting on Friday between Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, described by both sides as ""constructive"". In a statement issued later, the European Commission said: ""The EU and the UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.""

Identity checks on 'French murder suspect',"The man was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Friday A man arrested at Glasgow Airport on suspicion of murdering his family eight years ago was detained by mistake. Identity checks have shown that the man is not Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, Police Scotland confirmed. The 58-year-old has been on the runsince his wife and four children were found buried at their home in Nante in 2011,external. The detained man was stopped at the airport after arriving on a flight from Paris. Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife and four children In a statement Police Scotland said: ""On Friday, 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow Airport following information provided to police. ""He was held in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities. ""Inquiries were undertaken to confirm the man's identity. ""Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France. ""The man has since been released."" Mr Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife AgnÃ¨s, 48, and his children, Arthur, 21, Thomas, 18, Anne, 16, and BenoÃ®t, 13, whose bodies, as well as those of the family's two dogs, were discovered buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes in 2011. The murders, known as the ""Nantes slaughter"", deeply shocked France at the time. French prosecutors previously said he killed his victims in a ""methodical execution"", firing two bullets from a silenced weapon at close range into their heads, before he rolled them in lime and buried them under cement. Mr Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children's private Catholic high school that he had been transferred to a job in Australia. And he also allegedly told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme.

Stabbing suspect detained under Mental Health Act,"A man was apprehended by police after an attack at the Manchester Arndale A Manchester Arndale worker and a member of the public have been praised for helping to stop a stabbing in which three people were hurt. A man""lunged"" at people in the shopping centreon Friday and attacked a 19-year-old woman, a man, 59, and another woman, who are in hospital. Two others were hurt, but none of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening. A 40-year-old man has been detained under the Mental Health Act. Witnesses said people were ""screaming and running"" as they evacuated the centre after a man started to attack shoppers with a large knife. A police spokesman said the 19-year-old woman required surgery after being stabbed in her arm, while the 59-year-old man suffered stab wounds to his hand. As it happened: Manchester Arndale stabbings,external Forensic officers conduct investigations outside the shopping centre Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""We know that at least one member of staff from the Arndale and a member of the public intervened in the attack and we would like to praise and thank them for their bravery."" At a press conference earlier, police revealed they had searched a property in the city where the arrested man lived. Officers said they were trying to establish if he had any political, religious or ideological motivation for the attack, although nothing has so far has come to light. He was initially held on suspicion of assault then re-arrested on suspicion of terror offences before he was detained under the Mental Health Act. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said officials were keeping an ""open mind"". ""It's important not to jump to any conclusions although what I can say is that, at this stage, it would appear to be more mental-health related than political or religiously motivated."" He said the attack appeared to be ""an isolated incident"" and urged people to ""go about their weekend"" as they had planned. Staff were allowed back into the centre on Friday afternoon The shopping centre, which is close to the arena where a terror attack killed 22 people in 2017, re-opened for business on Saturday. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said: ""Every time we have had an incident of this sort in the city, Manchester shows its resilience, its ability to come together and its determination to get on with business - to get on with life - and that's what we see today.""

Bundee Aki became the first Ireland player to be red-carded in a World Cup match Knowing a five-point win would assure their progress regardless of events in Yokohama, Ireland began purposefully, with the decision to kick for the corner as opposed to taking an easy three points paying off twice in the first nine minutes. Captain Best drove over from a rolling maul, before the destructive Furlong broke through four would-be tacklers to cross as Ireland made the most of Samoan indiscipline. Sexton's first try, after a slick break and offload from Larmour, put Ireland on the cusp of the bonus point with just a quarter of the game gone. However, two incidents in the space of five moments threatened to completely alter the direction of the contest. After Lam barrelled over the top of Ireland's defence to put Samoa on the board, centre Aki was dismissed for a tackle direct to the head of fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. Samoa's momentum was short-lived as they failed to translate their numerical superiority into any sort of meaningful advantage. Sexton's show and go off the back of a scrum just before the interval saw Ireland enter the break with the job done, ensuring there was little in the way of tension when the players re-emerged from the tunnel. Larmour's was the silkiest footwork on display and he will be pushing for a quarter-final start In a satisfactory evening for Ireland, several loose passes and handling errors that contributed to some of their hairiest moments in the first half will come under the microscope with the All Blacks or the Springboks looming on the horizon. Attention will now turn to team selection for Ireland's biggest game since the last eight in 2015. While in truth there is a clear first-choice player in most positions, Leinster full-back Larmour put in a performance that may just persuade Schmidt to stick with the 22-year-old next week. An accusation that has been made against this Ireland team in recent times is that they are one-dimensional in attack. Against Samoa, Larmour was a constant and unpredictable threat with ball in hand as he sought to jink through the opposition defence at every opportunity. His probing paid off for Sexton's opening try and he was rewarded with a score of his own nine minutes after the break, latching onto Conor Murray's perfect flat pass. In Rob Kearney, Schmidt has a player who has delivered in most of Ireland's biggest games over the past decade, however Larmour's impressive outings against Scotland and Samoa will certainly have given the head coach food for thought. Johnny Sexton scored 18 points in the game, the most he has scored in a World Cup game Concerns over the condition of the pitch at the Hakatanomori Stadium rose to the surface during Friday's captain's run, during which Irish players were able to lift up the turf enough to fit a rugby ball underneath. Mercifully, the injuries that many thought inevitable on such a track did not materialise, and in general the pitch held up well for the 80 minutes. With the game being played totally on their terms in the second half, Ireland removed Sexton and Conor Murray, who once again displayed their importance to the side in two perfectly-controlled displays. The game situation also allowed Schmidt to give second-choice fly-half Joey Carbery some vital minutes to make an impression, with the Munster man having played just 20 minutes in the previous three games. After Stander powered over following sustained Irish pressure inside the Samoan five-metre line, it was Carbery's well-judged grubber kick that allowed Conway to put the finishing touches on a hugely satisfactory Irish display. Bundee Aki is the first player to be sent off for Ireland in a World Cup match, and the fourth to be sent off in any game for Ireland (Willie Duggan, Jamie Heaslip, CJ Stander). Samoa have now lost each of their last 11 games against Tier 1 opposition at the Rugby World Cup, their last such victory coming back in 1999 against Wales. There have now been seven red cards shown at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the previous highest at the tournament was four in both 1995 and 1999. This was the fifth time 14 men have beaten 15 in a Rugby World Cup match (excluding sin-binnings). Only Canada's 72-11 win against Namibia in 1999 has seen a bigger margin of victory (42 points) for the outnumbered side. This was just the fourth time Ireland have scored 4+ first-half tries in a Rugby World Cup match, five v Namibia 2003, five v Russia 2011, four v Canada in 2015.

French murder suspect arrested at Glasgow Airport,"The man was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Friday A man arrested at Glasgow Airport on suspicion of murdering his family eight years ago was detained by mistake. Identity checks have shown that the man is not Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, Police Scotland confirmed. The 58-year-old has been on the runsince his wife and four children were found buried at their home in Nante in 2011,external. The detained man was stopped at the airport after arriving on a flight from Paris. Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife and four children In a statement Police Scotland said: ""On Friday, 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow Airport following information provided to police. ""He was held in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities. ""Inquiries were undertaken to confirm the man's identity. ""Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France. ""The man has since been released."" Mr Dupont de Ligonnes is suspected of murdering his wife AgnÃ¨s, 48, and his children, Arthur, 21, Thomas, 18, Anne, 16, and BenoÃ®t, 13, whose bodies, as well as those of the family's two dogs, were discovered buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes in 2011. The murders, known as the ""Nantes slaughter"", deeply shocked France at the time. French prosecutors previously said he killed his victims in a ""methodical execution"", firing two bullets from a silenced weapon at close range into their heads, before he rolled them in lime and buried them under cement. Mr Dupont de Ligonnes reportedly told his teenage children's private Catholic high school that he had been transferred to a job in Australia. And he also allegedly told friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into a witness protection programme. A large police operation was mounted in the Var region of southern France in January last year after witnesses reported seeing a man resembling him near a monastery.

"Payments giants abandon Facebook's LibraMastercard, Visa, eBay and Stripe join PayPal in no longer supporting Facebook's effort to launch a currency.TechnologyI have not done anything wrong - FarahMo Farah hits back as he faces media questions after his former coach was banned.BBC Sport","Facebook had said it hoped to launch Libra in 2020 Mastercard, Visa, eBay and payments firm Stripe have pulled out of Facebookâs embattled cryptocurrency project, Libra. Their move,first reported in the Financial Times,external, follows the withdrawal of PayPal, announced last week. It represents a huge blow to the social networkâs plans to launch what it envisions as a global currency. The project has drawn heavy scrutiny from regulators and politicians, particularly in the US. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will appear before the House Committee on Financial Services on 23 October to discuss Libra and its planned roll-out. Regulators have raised multiple concerns over Libra, including the risk it may be used for money laundering. Mercado Pago, a payments firm serving mostly Latin America, also pulled out. It means of the six payments-related firms first involved in Libra, just one, PayU, remains. Netherlands-based PayU did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Friday. In a statement released on Friday, eBay said it ârespectedâ the Libra project. âHowever, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBayâs managed payments experience for our customers.â A spokesperson for Stripe said the firm supported the aim of making global payments easier. ""Libra has this potential. We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.â A spokesperson for Visa said: ""We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations."" The Libra Association, set up by Facebook to manage the project, said of the departing companies: ""We appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project. ""Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient. ""We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.â Facebook's executive in charge of its Libra effort wrote on Twitter that losing the firms was ""liberating"". ""I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,"" wrote David Marcus, who before joining Facebook was PayPal's president. ""Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up."" Last week,PayPal said it would no longer be part of the Libra Association, but did not rule out working on the project in future - prompting a strong reaction from the Association. ""Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else,"" it said in a statement.

"Ireland seek to secure quarter-final placeTeam news, stats and what they said as Ireland aim to secure a World Cup quarter-finals spot by earning a bonus-point win over Samoa.BBC SportComments","Johnny Sexton scored two tries as Ireland secured a bonus point before half-time 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A: Ireland v Samoa Ireland (26) 47 Tries:Best, Furlong, Sexton 2, Larmour, Stander, ConwayCons:Sexton 4, Carbery 2 Samoa (5) 5 Try:J Lam Ireland booked their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a seven-try win over Samoa in Fukuoka. Ireland had to play over half the match with 14 men after Bundee Aki's 29th-minute dismissal, though tries by Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong and Johnny Sexton had already put them in control. Jack Lam replied but another Sexton try secured a bonus point before half-time. Jordan Larmour, CJ Stander and Andrew Conway also crossed as Ireland navigated the second half unscathed.

Japan floods ahead of biggest typhoon in decades,"Helicopters rescued people trapped in their homes when the Chikuma river burst its banks At least nine people are reported dead as Japan recovers from its biggest storm in decades. Typhoon Hagibis triggered floods and landslides as it battered the country with wind speeds of 225km/h (140mph). Rivers have breached their banks in at least 14 different places, inundating residential neighbourhoods. The storm led to some Rugby World Cup matches being cancelled but a key fixture between Japan and Scotland will go ahead on Sunday. Hagibis is heading north and is expected to move back into the North Pacific later on Sunday. In pictures: Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan It made landfall on Saturday shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT), in Izu Peninsula, south-west of Tokyo and moved up the east coast. Almost half a million homes were left without power. In the town of Hakone near Mount Fuji more than 1m (3ft) of rain fell on Friday and Saturday, the highest total ever recorded in Japan over 48 hours. This video can not be played More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes Further north in Nagano prefecture, levees along the Chikuma river gave way sending water rushing through residential areas, inundating houses. Flood defences around Tokyo have held and river levels are now falling, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Japan. Officials said some of those killed were swept away by landslides while others were trapped in their cars as floodwaters rose. Another 15 people are listed as missing and dozens are reported injured. More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes as the huge storm approached, but it is thought only 50,000 stayed in shelters. Many residents stocked up on provisions before the typhoon's arrival, leaving supermarkets with empty shelves. Torrential rain has caused rivers to flood huge areas A huge clean-up operation was under way in Kawasaki near Tokyo ""Unprecedented heavy rain has been seen in cities, towns and villages for which the emergency warning was issued,"" Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) forecaster Yasushi Kajiwara told a press briefing. Many bullet train services were halted, and several lines on the Tokyo metro were suspended for most of Saturday. All flights to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport and Narita airport in Chiba have been cancelled - more than 1,000 in total. Bullet trains were half submerged in Nagano, central Japan Two Rugby World Cup games scheduled for Saturday were cancelled on safety grounds and declared as draws - England-France and New Zealand-Italy. The cancellations were the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Sunday's Namibia-Canada match due to take place in Kamaishi was also cancelled and declared a draw. The US-Tonga fixture in Osaka and Wales-Uruguay in Kumamoto will go ahead as scheduled on Sunday, organisers said. Meanwhile, a crunch game between Scotland and tournament hosts Japan on Sunday will now go ahead. The decision followed a safety inspection. Scotland against Japan to go ahead The Japanese Formula One Grand Prix is also taking place on Sunday. Vettel in pole position for Japanese Grand Prix Local resident James Babb spoke to the BBC from an evacuation centre in Hachioji, western Tokyo. He said the river near his house was on the brink of overflowing. ""I am with my sister-in-law, who is disabled,"" he said. ""Our house may flood. They have given us a blanket and a biscuit."" Tornado-like winds whipped up by the typhoon struck east of Tokyo Andrew Higgins, an English teacher who lives in Tochigi, north of Tokyo, told the BBC he had ""lived through a few typhoons"" during seven years in Japan. ""I feel like this time Japan, generally, has taken this typhoon a lot more seriously,"" he said. ""People were out preparing last night. A lot of people were stocking up."" Only last month Typhoon Faxai wreaked havoc on parts of Japan, damaging 30,000 homes, most of which have not yet been repaired. ""I evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I'm so worried about my house,"" a 93-year-old man told NHK, from a shelter in Tateyama, Chiba. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Japan suffers about 20 typhoons a year, but Tokyo is rarely hit on this scale.

Trump's week of confusion,"Mr Trump flanked by the Turkish and Saudi leaders at the G20 summit in June During a television interview this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US did not give a ""green light"" for Turkey to launch strikes against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The mixed messages from President Donald Trump over the course of this week, however, tell a different story. The latest crisis in war-torn Syria began on Sunday night, with a statement from the White House press secretary - after the president had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - that effectively treated a Turkish military incursion as a done deal. ""Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,"" the statement read. ""The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and the United States forces, having defeated the Isis territorial 'Caliphate,' will no longer be in the immediate area."" The statement, which contained no mention of the US-backed Kurds or hints of objection to the Turkish operation, quickly set off howls of anger among the US foreign policy establishment and members of Congress on the left and right. ""This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids,"" South Carolina Republican SenatorLindsey Graham tweeted the following morning,external. ""Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys."" 100,000 flee as Turkey steps up Syria offensive Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Four maps explaining the offensive The ferocity of the criticism grew as it became clear that US forces had indeed withdrawn from northern Syria and the Turkish military was launching its assault. What followed was a series of sometimes contradictory statements and tweets from the president - a hodgepodge of calls for disengagement, warnings of dire consequences, and suggestions of peaceful resolution. This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict ""We will fight where it is to our benefit, and only fight to win,""Mr Trump tweeted on Monday,external, after saying that he held off a Turkey-Kurdish conflict for three years, but that it was time for the US to get out of ""endless wars"". By later in the day, however, the president was cautioning Turkey that if it did anything that he considered ""off limits"" he would ""destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey"". On Tuesday, he was praising Turkey for being a US trading partner and assuring the Syrian Kurds (who were already by this time under Turkish assault) that the US had not abandoned them. The next day, he said he hoped the Turkish operation would be conducted ""in as humane a way as possible"" - and, if not, Turkey would pay a ""very big economic price"". By Thursday, he was once again distancing himself from the Kurds, telling reporters that while he ""liked"" them, they were only fighting for ""their land"" and did not, for instance, help the US invade Germany in the Second World War. (It should be noted that Kurds did fight against Iraqi forces sympathetic to the Nazis.) What did the Kurds ever do for the US? Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered Could Turkish offensive unleash IS threat? Mr Trump concluded Thursday by tweeting that the US ""did our job perfectly"" in Syria and now had three choices in dealing with the crisis: send thousands of troops to secure the area; impose economic sanctions on Turkey; or ""mediate a deal"" between the Turks and the Kurds.

Meanwhile, Trump administration officials were left scrambling to realise the frequently conflicting objectives of vocalising their objections to a Turkish operation they had long sought to avoid, while defending the president's decision - which,according to Politico and others,external, was made without consulting foreign allies, Congress or even some members of his own administration. US Republicans seek sanctions on Turkey over Syria US says it did not approve Turkish offensive On Monday, Defence Secretary Mark Esper sent - and then deleted - a tweet saying the Turkish move into northern Syria would have ""destabilising consequences... to Turkey, the region, & beyond"". The White House on Wednesday released a ""statement"" by the president saying the Turkish invasion was a ""bad idea"" that the US did not ""endorse"". On Friday, Mr Esper called it a ""tough situation"" and said Turkey's action was damaging US-Turkey relations. Pro-Turkish Syrian fighters advance into Kurdish-held territory ""This was a very big mistake and this has very big implications for all of our security,"" a senior State Department officialtold CNN on Friday,external. ""I don't know of anybody who isn't upset with it."" All told, the US moved between 50 to 100 troops out of northern Syria this week, as Turkish forces prepared their assault. Despite withering criticism, Mr Trump has framed it as fulfilling a campaign promise to extricate the US from a Middle East quagmire it should never have been involved in to begin with. Indeed, on Thursday night at a rally in Minnesota, he falsely said: ""We don't have any soldiers there because we've left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States."" Yet, hours later, the Defence Department announced that 3,000 US soldiers - including two fighter squadrons - were being dispatched to Saudi Arabia ""to ensure and enhance the defence"" of that nation. Since May, a Pentagon spokesperson noted, US troops in the Middle East and Afghanistan ""Central Command"" region increased by approximately 14,000.

"Japan floods ahead of biggest typhoon in decadesTyphoon Hagibis could be the worst to hit Japan since 1958 when more than 1,200 people died.","Helicopters rescued people trapped in their homes when the Chikuma river burst its banks At least nine people are reported dead as Japan recovers from its biggest storm in decades. Typhoon Hagibis triggered floods and landslides as it battered the country with wind speeds of 225km/h (140mph). Rivers have breached their banks in at least 14 different places, inundating residential neighbourhoods. The storm led to some Rugby World Cup matches being cancelled but a key fixture between Japan and Scotland will go ahead on Sunday. Hagibis is heading north and is expected to move back into the North Pacific later on Sunday. In pictures: Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan It made landfall on Saturday shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT), in Izu Peninsula, south-west of Tokyo and moved up the east coast. Almost half a million homes were left without power. In the town of Hakone near Mount Fuji more than 1m (3ft) of rain fell on Friday and Saturday, the highest total ever recorded in Japan over 48 hours. This video can not be played More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes Further north in Nagano prefecture, levees along the Chikuma river gave way sending water rushing through residential areas, inundating houses. Flood defences around Tokyo have held and river levels are now falling, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Japan. Officials said some of those killed were swept away by landslides while others were trapped in their cars as floodwaters rose. Another 15 people are listed as missing and dozens are reported injured. More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes as the huge storm approached, but it is thought only 50,000 stayed in shelters.

Bullet trains were half submerged in Nagano, central Japan Two Rugby World Cup games scheduled for Saturday were cancelled on safety grounds and declared as draws - England-France and New Zealand-Italy. The cancellations were the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Sunday's Namibia-Canada match due to take place in Kamaishi was also cancelled and declared a draw.

Five people hurt in Arndale Centre knife attack,"The suspect was apprehended by police Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the Arndale Centre in Manchester. A man, aged 40, initially arrested on suspicion of terror offences, has been detained under the Mental Health Act. Three people were stabbed and two others were hurt when a man with a large knife started ""lunging and attacking people"", according to police. He chased two police community support officers (PCSOs) before being detained, the force said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) believe he was acting alone. The force said the man had been assessed ""by specialist doctors"". Investigations into the motives behind the attack are continuing. One witness said they saw a man ""running around with a knife lunging at multiple people"", while another described people ""screaming and running"". The centre was put on lockdown as officers confronted the attacker, with some shoppers taking refuge in stores. There was a large police presence outside the Arndale shopping centre A shop worker, who only gave his name as Jordan, 23, said: ""A man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze. ""Soon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores."" Speaking at a press conference, Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""random"" and ""brutal"" attack. As it happened: Manchester Arndale stabbings,external ACC Jackson said a man armed with a knife entered the Exchange Court area of the centre before he ""lunged"" at shoppers and began ""attacking people with the knife"". ""Two unarmed police community support officers were in Exchange Court and attempted to confront the attacker. ""He then chased them with the knife as they were calling for urgent assistance."" Within five minutes armed officers detained the suspect on Market Street outside the centre, he added. In a tweet, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Shocked by the incident in Manchester and my thoughts are with the injured and all those affected."" Allow Twitter content?
