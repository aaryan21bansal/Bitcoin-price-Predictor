'Snow chaos' and UK role in Trump scandal,"Christopher Steele is believed to have left his home this week Many of the papers lead on the former MI6 officer named as the man who compiled the damaging dossier on Donald Trump leaked earlier this week. According to the Telegraph, Britain has beendragged into the row,externalover the dossier after it was claimed that the government gave the FBI permission to speak to Christopher Steele. It says Britain now finds itself caught in the crossfire of accusations between Russia and the US. The Mail says Russia's relations with Britain havegone into the deep freeze,externalas Moscow blamed MI6 for the dossier. The paper quotes a tweet from the Russian embassy in London suggesting Mr Steele was still working for MI6 and ""briefing both ways"" against Mr Trump and Moscow. The Mirror's front page has apicture of a two-year-old boy,externallying on two chairs put together as a makeshift bed at a hospital in Hastings in East Sussex due to a lack of proper beds. It says Jack Harwood - who had suspected meningitis - waited for five hours in A&E with his mother, as staff struggled to cope with the volume of patients. His case was put to Theresa May by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The boy was eventually sent home after his temperature was brought down and his relieved parents were told he didn't have meningitis. The new King of Rwanda has been proclaimed - and he lives in a terrace house on an estate in Greater Manchester. The Guardian says it'snot a typical royal residence,external- but the Rwandan royal family has been exiled since 1961. The Daily Mail says Emmanuel Bushayija is thought to bethe first Briton to accede as a king,externalsince George the Sixth inherited the throne following the abdication crisis in 1936.  It seems Mr Bushayija has been keeping a low profile since his elevation, but neighbours tell the paper he's a lovely man and it's a great honour to live next to him. Twenty-five years ago, the Sun portrayed Graham Taylor - then England football manager - as a turnip after the national team were knocked out during the group stages of Euro 92. Graham Taylor died aged 72 on Thursday Following his death - announced yesterday - it pays tribute to him in its leader column. While it acknowledges his failings as manager, it highlights his successes at club level, describing him as a genius. He had a magnificent football brain and made a fine radio pundit, it adds. Above all - it goes on - he was just a thoroughly decent bloke. Finally, you could save yourself as much as nine thousand pounds on a house purchase - if you don't mind living at number 13.  Research by the property website, Zoopla - released to coincide with today's date, Friday the 13th - found that nearly a third of homebuyers are less likely to buy a property with this number. But - the Mail reports -those who are not put off,externalby it will find a house with this number typically cheaper than the average UK property.  On the other hand, the most expensive door number tends to be number one - and Number 100 the next most expensive.

Football set to pay tribute to Taylor,"This video can not be played Obituary: Graham Taylor Football is preparing to pay tribute to former England manager Graham Taylor at fixtures taking place this weekend. Taylor, who enjoyed success with Watford, Wolves, Aston Villa and Lincoln City, died aged 72 on Thursday. A minute's applause will be held before the weekend's English Football League matches. Watford, whom he managed for 15 years over two spells, will commemorate Taylor before their game against Middlesbrough on Saturday. Obituary: 'Perhaps now his work will get the credit it deserves' 'I love you Graham, I'll miss you very much' - Sir Elton John pays tribute Listen again to a 5 live special: Tributes to Graham Taylor The EFL said it was also giving clubs the option of letting their players wear black armbands during this weekend's fixtures. The Premier League will leave the decision of whether to pay tribute to individual clubs. Its executive chairman Richard Scudamore said Taylor's ""insight, wit and self-deprecating humour"" would be missed. ""You will struggle to find a more decent individual in football - one who cared passionately about all levels and aspects of the English game,"" he said. Meanwhile, Watford supporters have been laying tributes to Taylor outside their stadium, where a stand is named after their former manager, chairman and, more recently, honorary vice-president. As a club manager, Taylor led Watford from the Fourth Division to runners-up in the old First Division in five years, and to the 1984 FA Cup final. He took Aston Villa to second in the First Division, returning to Watford and Villa after his spell in charge of the national side, and also managing Wolves. Wolves meet Aston Villa in a Championship game at Molineux on Saturday. Taylor became England boss in 1990 but resigned in 1993 after the team failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He later became a respected pundit for BBC Sport. He leaves behind his wife Rita and daughters Joanne and Karen. This video can not be played Graham Taylor dies at 72 - His FA Cup Story In the aftermath of the news of Taylor's death, emotional tributes poured in from the football community. BBC Radio 5 live hosted a tribute show in Taylor's honour, in which his colleagues and peers spoke about the effect he had on their lives. Former England captain Alan Shearer,who was given his national team debut by Taylor, said he held him in the ""highest, highest regard"". ""The biggest and best compliment I can give him is he was genuine, honest, passionate and down to earth,"" he said. ""Most of all, he just absolutely loved his football. He was so genuine, so honest and his passion for the game was just immense."" Burnley manager Sean Dyche- whose first managerial position was at Watford, where Taylor offered him guidance, said he would be ""forever in his debt"". ""He had an extremely thick skin, and he showed that by defending me on the radio when I was a young manager as well. Things like that mean a lot,"" he said. ""To have that strength behind me when I was a young manager meant a lot."" John Murray, a football commentator for 5 live who worked with him during his time as a pundit and summariser, said that Taylor was ""everything I had hoped before I met him"". ""He was steeped in football - he was brilliant at being interested in other people and would always want to talk about football,"" he said. ""I'd describe him as one of the football managers of our time. His club career was outstanding."" This video can not be played Graham Taylor: Alan Shearer pays tribute to former England boss Fans have been paying tribute to Taylor too, with thousands of people using social media to share their stories of the former England manager: Robert Howard:I spent a train journey from Hemel Hempstead to Euston sitting talking to Graham. We spoke about football old and new. Kids, football and life in general. He was friendly, open and a very nice man. I am glad I met him. Alan Jones:I refereed a youth team match between Portsmouth and Watford. On the same afternoon, Watford's first team were due to play Bournemouth, so they stopped at Eastleigh to watch the youth match on their way there. Graham came into the dressing room afterwards and thanked me for the game, which he thoroughly enjoyed. He looked at the towel around my waist and asked me to get a new one, as he did not like orange. He was a very charming and supportive ambassador for football. RIP. Dave Revell:Met Graham Taylor at a charity day for Kit Aid. Had so much time for people and was always so nice. One of England's better managers. Will Room:I remember seeing a clip of Taylor in the dugout during a match, and some fans behind him shouting out racial abuse to John Barnes and he went hell for leather against them - didn't hold back telling the fans to sit down and shut up basically. Back then it was probably normal for fans to think they could get away with stuff like that but Graham Taylor was definitely a decent man and respected everyone who played for him. Top bloke. Taylor worked in football for 55 years, from the start of his playing career in 1962 to his punditry work with the BBC Taylor started out as a player and, after coming through the youth ranks with Scunthorpe, was a defender at Grimsby and Lincoln. He became manager at Lincoln in 1972 aged 28, and led them to the old Fourth Division title in 1975-76 before joining Watford. In his first spell as Hornets boss between 1977 and 1987, Taylor took the club to the top flight and they finished second to Liverpool in 1983. He was appointed by Villa in 1987 and, after leading them to promotion into the top tier, took them to second in 1990. His exploits led to his appointment as England manager, but he had a turbulent spell in charge of the national team as they failed to make it out of the group at Euro 92 and did not qualify for the World Cup in the United States two years later. Taylor's return to club management came with a relatively brief stint at Wolves before he again took over at Watford, leading them to two promotions in as many years as he guided them back into English football's top flight. He also returned to manage Villa in 2002 but retired a year later. His association with Watford continued when he became chairman in 2009, a post he held for three years, and the clubrenamed their Rous Stand at Vicarage Road after Taylor in 2014. ""In this day and age, when a stand is named after somebody, it's for commercial reasons. I felt honoured,"" he told BBC Three Counties Radio at the time.

Time to earn my money and run - DeGale,"This video can not be played Will champion DeGale step out of the shadows? Super-middleweight world title unification fight Venue:Barclays Centre, New YorkDate:Saturday 14 JanuaryTime:03:30 GMT approx on Sunday Coverage:Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live. IBF super-middleweight champion James DeGale intends to prove he is ""one of the best fighters in the world"" in his unification bout with WBC champion Badou Jack in New York. The Briton, 30, fights Sweden's Jack, 34, at around 03:30 GMT on Sunday. DeGale weighed in 1.5lb (0.68kg) inside the 12-stone (76.2kg) limit, while Jack was 0.75lb (0.34kg) inside. ""This is the moment. I can't wait to return to the UK as a unified world champion,"" DeGale said. He added: ""This is a great fight for boxing and it's going to raise my appeal all over the world."" DeGale, who has won 23 of his 24 professional bouts, has admitted money is another motivation for victory. ""I've worked hard all my life,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Now I've got myself in a position where I can financially secure me and my family. ""It's time to strike while the iron's hot, get in the big fights, earn my money and run."" The 2008 Olympic gold medallist added: ""It's not just about the money but I'm a prizefighter. ""I've got all the accolades now, the only thing that's missing is the millions in the bank."" His opponent Jack, who has 20 wins, two draws and one defeat on his record, has million-dollar backing behind him as he is managed by Floyd Mayweather. DeGale has prepared for the fight with a strength and conditioning coach - the first time he has used one. ""It's because I was getting fatigued in fights,"" he explained. He also said he had dreamt of fighting in New York since he was a child, watching his hero, Britain's former world featherweight champion Naseem Hamed, against Kevin Kelley. ""At the age of 10, I was thinking, 'yes, that's going to be me',"" he said. ""I'm living the dream."" Trainer banned after Blackwell session Will champion DeGale step out of the shadows?

Free lunches,"Propercorn gives out free popcorn at fashion and arts events in London As the saying goes, ""there is no such thing as a free lunch"", but it may be easier to get one if you are young, fashionable and live in a capital city. Attendees at last autumn's London Fashion Week didn't have to worry about their snacking needs. Outside the main venue in Brewer Street, Soho, a team of workers from upmarket UK popcorn brand Propercorn were there every day to hand out free packets. In total they gave away some 30,000 samples, in what was the 10th time in a row they have been generous at the biannual event. For Propercorn the giveaway is part of a strategy that also sees it offer free packets at arts events in the UK capital, such as Late at the Tate Britain, when the art museum opens its doors at night and puts on a music concert. It is a deliberate move by the company to target the so-called trendsetters and influencers, in the hope that they will speak positively about the product, giving it a word-of-mouth buzz. Propercorn says it wants to be part of an ""exciting cultural dialogue"" A Propercorn spokesman explains: ""Positioning popcorn outside of traditional snack circles, and looking for inspiration at design, fashion, wellbeing and entrepreneurship events, helps us to remain fresh and part of this exciting cultural dialogue. ""It's less about immediate increase in sales, and more about getting our product in the hands of people who will excitedly and personally engage in our brand and story."" Everyone loves a freebie, but is it really free? Not even remotely, says Jean-Pierre Dube, professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Instead, the cost of giving away free samples comes from a firm's marketing budget, which in turn comes from its overall earnings. Lipton gave away free drinks at a number of breakfast events in London Prof Dube says: ""Giving things away is definitely a form of marketing. ""[For example], when you buy a ski vacation that comes with 'free lessons', the lessons are of course not free. ""The price of the package was set with the lessons taken into account."" He adds: ""But what about literally giving things away? There is still no free. ""This is an investment the firm makes in anticipation of receiving the reward in the future. For example, [US cable TV firm] Comcast gave away free digital video recorders as a promotion a few years ago. This was just an investment in receiving the monthly cash flows from people's service subscriptions."" If you want to be handed a freebie on the street, it certainly helps to live in a country's capital or largest city. Lipton said it wanted to create a ""clearly different brand experience"" This is not simply because of the larger population, but because a country's main conurbation is more often the trendsetter for retail purchases. So in the UK new products or new promotional campaigns are invariably launched in London, in the US it is New York, while in France it is Paris, and so on. The hope is that the young and fashionable of the big city will try the item, like it, and then talk positively about it - preferably on social media in this day and age. If all goes to plan this will kick start increased sales across the country as a whole. Consumer goods giant Unilever went for this approach last year when it sought to increase UK sales of its Lipton Ice Tea brand. Lipton's Daybreakers campaign saw it give out free drinks at a number of breakfast events across London that included DJ sets and live music. Venues included Old Street in fashionable east London, and the Sky Garden venue at the top of the 34-floor 20 Fenchurch Street building, otherwise known as the ""walkie talkie"". A Lipton spokesman says: ""In order for people to look at Lipton Ice Tea in a new way, we needed to offer consumers a meaningful and relevant reason to try it. Innocent has targeted music festivals to give out free samples ""We therefore went down an early morning experimental road to cut through and create a clearly different brand experience."" UK drinks firm Innocent is also in the habit of first giving out free samples in London, such as when it launched its coconut water product in 2015. This saw it hand out free samples at a pop-up bar in the trendy Shoreditch area. Innocent, which is majority owned by US giant Coca-Cola, has since gone on to offer free samples at UK music festivals Latitude and Wilderness, and at sporting events such as the Richmond marathon, in south west London. Last year it gave away more than 500,000 cartons. James Peach, Innocent's coconut water brand manager, says: ""For [free] sampling to be effective it's important to be targeting the right type of consumer at the moment they would most likely want to use the product, so they get the most out of the experience, and understand the product's benefits. ""Generally people drink coconut water to naturally re-hydrate or rejuvenate themselves after exercise or after excess [if they are hungover]. So we simply try to target those occasions as much as we can, to be there when people need it most."" While most consumers don't give freebies much thought, behavioural economist Enrico Trevisan says that from the perspective of the business there are three main types; ""future selling"", ""cross selling"" and ""up-selling"". ""In the future selling approach, firms give away a product for free, assuming that clients will like it and want to buy more in the future,"" he says. The New York Times operates an up-selling free model ""With cross-selling, the company tries to gain new clients through an entrance product, with the intention of selling them additional products during their life cycle."" Mr Trevisan, who works for marketing consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners, says that an example of cross-selling is banks giving current accounts away for free in order to later sell the client loans, mortgages and overdrafts. Finally, he says that up-selling is when a firm gives away a basic version of the product, but then charges the client for more advanced and complete versions. He cites the examples of online news websites that only offer a limited number of free articles. However, Mr Trevisan cautions that while ""giving something for free to potential users is not necessarily complicated, to convert them into paying customers is a very different story"".

Graham Taylor obituary,"Taylor took Watford from the Fourth Division to the First in five seasons in his first spell at the club, and into the Premier League via the play-offs in his second Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game. The reaction to Taylor's death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977. It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years. Listen again to a 5 live special: Tributes to Graham Taylor This video can not be played Obituary: Graham Taylor Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton. Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: ""You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I don't need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood."" Taylor's unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the manager's down-to-earth approach dovetailing with his chairman's lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated bySir Elton's heartfelt tribute. On trips abroad when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Sir Elton John posted an Instagram message to pay tribute to his ""brother"" Taylor's brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987. Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990. Taylor's methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as ""long ball"" football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylor's direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. This video can not be played Graham Taylor dies at 72 - His FA Cup Story This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Taylor's career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years. Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer. England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm. Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a ""turnip"" in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'The Impossible Job', which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam. The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on England's David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory. He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996. It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton. This video can not be played The day Graham Taylor resigned as England boss Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception. Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect. There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met.

Apostle to the Apostles?,"The emotional scene in John's Gospel in which Jesus calls to the grieving Mary Magdalene by name and she tries to touch him has inspired many artists. This is Titian's interpretation. The gospels depict Mary Magdalene as one of Jesus' closest companions. Her emotional encounter with the risen Jesus and her supposed sinful past have fascinated Christians for centuries. The latest of many films about her is released shortly. Its heroine,played by Rooney Mara,external, is billed as a young woman who joins ""a radical new social movement"" and ""must confront the reality of Jesus' destiny and her own place within it"". There was amusement when cast members were pictured in ancient garb smoking on set. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church has enhanced the saint's status. Last year her Saint's Day (22 July) was promoted to a Feast, equal to those of most of the male Disciples. Explaining the decision, Archbishop Arthur Roche,externalpointed out that she had long been known as ""apostle to the apostles, as she announces to the apostles what they in turn will announce to all the world."" A bizarre tradition in depictions of Mary Magdalene shows her naked, but clothed with her long red hair. Terracotta by Andrea Della Robbia of about 1590 This refers to John 20:17, in which Jesus sends her to the disciples to tell them he would ascend to God - ""apostolos"" in Greek means ""one who is sent"". The Vatican press office said,externalthat 22 July would be ""a feast,like that of the other apostles."" A special prayer for use at Mass on that day says Jesus honoured her with the task of an apostle (apostolatus officio), This has coincided with what some believe are signs of a change in Rome's attitude on the possibility of women priests. The announcement on Mary Magdalene, and the setting up of a commission to discuss theordination of women as deacons,external- not priests, but able to preside at weddings, christenings and funerals is an indication to some of change. Tina Beattie, Professor of Catholic Studies at the University of Roehampton, says: ""I accept that it has to be slow, it has to be sensitively done... But my own feeling is that something is happening"". What was said about the feast day was encouraging, says Pippa Bonner of the campaign group Catholic Women's Ordination. ""As soon as we spotted that we shared that news around - I think that's a very, very positive step."" Pope Francis met Sweden's female archbishop, Antje Jackelen. But on his journey home he said Catholic policy forbidding women priests had not changed. In 1994 Pope John Paul II declared ""thatthe Church has no authority,externalwhatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful."" Jesus had ""called only men as his Apostles"", The constant practice of the Church, he stressed, ""has imitated Christ in choosing only men."" In November, while returning from a visit to Sweden where he worshipped with the country's female Lutheran archbishop, Antje Jackelen, Pope Francis was asked if his Church still ruled out women priests. ""Saint Pope John Paul II had the last clear word on this and it stands,""he said,external. Asked again if the ban was permanent, he responded: ""If we read carefully the declaration by St. John Paul II, it is going in that direction."" Prof Beattie comments: ""Whenever he's asked to give a reason he always references John Paul II... I'm not aware of him saying that under his own Papal authority."" St Mary Magdalene Paloma Baeza played Mary Magdalene in The Passion, shown on BBC1 in 2008. Appears in all four gospels as one of Jesus's closest companions during his ministry in Galilee and Jerusalem in the first century AD. She has colleges named after her at both Oxford and Cambridge, a distinction she shares with Jesus. The gospel of Luke says seven demons had ""come out of her"". Mark says Jesus cast them out. ""Magdalene"" seems to come from an Aramaic word for tower - it may refer to a place name. Legend tells that she went to Gaul (France) in a rudderless boat and died there after a life spent in devotion and repentance. For centuries it was disputed whether her body was at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume in Provence or Vezelay in Burgundy. The idea that statements about Mary Magdalene and her ""apostleship"" contradict the rulings of John Paul II is discounted by many Catholic commentators. ""Many Catholics from the Anglican tradition will rejoice at her commemoration being raised to the dignity of a Feast, while thinking that the idea that this has any relevance to the closed question of women's ordination is entirely fanciful,"" says Fr Simon Chinery, spokesman for the Ordinariate set up by Pope Benedict as a home within the Catholic Church for Anglicans opposed to women bishops. The idea of Mary Magdalene as a great sinner led to celebration of her as a great penitent, as in this haggard sculpture by Donatello (about 1455). Austen Ivereigh, co-founder of the group Catholic Voices, says: ""Declaring her day a Feast reflects a growing awareness that the role of women in the early Church was an important one, and needs to be recovered. ""But opening church leadership to women's unique gifts does not equate to opening the priesthood to women - at least that argument is not being made in any significant way in the Church at the moment,"" Arguments against women's ordination in the Church of England were ultimately unsuccessful. But of course the Catholic Church is very different. In the CofE the argument over women's ordination went on for decades. But it was possible to say where it had got to by referring to the state of discussions in the General Synod. It could not have been stopped for good by a ruling like that of Pope John Paul. Of all the hundreds of churches named after Mary Magdalene, the grandest is perhaps La Madeleine in Paris. Marochetti's statue on the high altar shows angels lifting her to heaven.. A change in doctrine can come as news to Catholics. And it can happen suddenly. That was the case with Mary Magdalene herself. In the late 6th Century AD Pope Gregory I declared that she was also the woman in Luke 7:37 who ""lived a sinful life"", who washed Jesus's feet and dried them with her hair. This fuelled the tradition that Mary Magdalene was not only a sinner (which Christianity says we all are) but a particularly colourful one, and inspired dozens of artistic portrayals of her ranging from ravaged penitent to borderline erotic. But the revised Roman Calendar of 1969 simply declared that 22 July was indeed the day of Mary Magdalene, but she was not the woman in Luke 7:37. And that, after nearly 1,400 years. was that. Is she, as the Anglican Rev Giles Fraser claims some see her,""the standard bearer,externalfor women's developing role in the Catholic church, and even... for women's ordination""? The Church can hardly show it is moved by the late unofficial gospels - one of which talks ofJesus repeatedly kissing Mary Magdalene,external,; the recent crop of stories claiming she was actually married to Jesus; or the Rooney Mara film. And Pope Gregory's claims about her sinful life may be discredited. But all these things contribute to her prestige.

Jingle tills,"Now the leftovers are all curry and the tree is at the tip, it's time to digest the news from the retail sector over just how merry a Christmas it really was. And it seems that just like Mr Scrooge, UK shoppers were persuaded to open their purses just a little wider this year. So if you're one of those who splashed out on gin, indulged in a new jumper and pulled out all the stops for your festive feast, you are in good company. But how and where was the festive cheer felt most? Here's our look at where the glass is half full and where half empty as we head into 2017. Supermarkets It's not likely to be a dry January if you're running one of the UK's supermarkets. They have good news to toast this week. Tesco and Morrisons, which have both had a difficult few years, have reported stronger sales. Tesco said fresh food had been""particularly popular, outperforming the market"", adding that there had been a 24% increase in party food sales over Christmas, while Morrisons reported itsstrongest Christmas sales for seven years. Even Sainsbury's, which saw a meagre0.1% overall rise in sales, managed to beat analyst expectations of a 0.8% fall. DiscountersLidlandAldidon't report their figures in quite the same way - they do not give like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings and are therefore a better comparison - but both reported double-digit increases in Christmas sales, reflecting brisk business. It looks like we collectively loosened our belts at just the right time for the big food retailers. ""I guess the biggest impression so far is that food retailers did better than non-food in December,"" says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. According to Kantar Worldpanel wespent almost half a billion pounds more,externalin the final 12 weeks of 2016 compared with the year before (so no wonder we're still ploughing through the chocolate biscuits and checking out stilton soup recipes). But putting it into context, a lot of the good results now are set against a backdrop of pretty weak performances the previous year. If you look at the grocery sector in 2015,TescoandMorrisonswere both implementing turnaround plans, whileSainsbury'sandAsdaalso faced sales challenges. ""Overall, food had an ok end of the year and traded ok over the course of the year but that was against very low comparitors,"" says Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. Dressed to impress It wasn't just the food stores that have given the market cause for cheer. High Street stalwart Marks and Spencer finally shrugged off a decline in clothing sales Early in the monthNext had everyone spookedas it reported a drop in sales in the run-up to Christmas, but plenty of other clothing retailers have reported strong results. M&S surprised the marketwith sales in its clothing and homeware division up 2.3% - well above expectations for about 0.5% - while John Lewis, Debenhams, Ted Baker and online retailers Boohoo.com and Asos also reported sales growth. Strong festive periods were also seen at Primark, JD Sports and Superdry owner Supergroup, which saw like-for-like sales up 15% over the Christmas period. Next said it was preparing for ""tougher times"" in the year ahead ""The biggest loser is obviously Next so far. They've had a bit of a shocker,"" says Patrick O'Brien from Verdict Retail. Next saw sales of full-price items fall 0.4% andwarned of a ""challenging"" 2017. ""Next [used to be] way ahead of the others with its online operation. But competitors have now caught up with that in terms of online and collection, with really high growth in online specialists like Boohoo,"" he says. But apart from that the really surprising thing is how few bad results there have been. Partly that is because they started from a low base after the poor sales of 2015, and partly because British consumers simply held their nerve. ""Consumers have understood that prices are going up and it's been a good time to buy,"" says Mr O'Brien. Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, adds: ""The British defied the mood music out there and wanted to go out and treat themselves and celebrate Christmas. That's the most surprising thing in a world where negative news is easier to come by than positive."" John Lewis has warned of a ""challenging"" outlook and said that its staff bonus will be ""significantly lower"" this year But if 2016 ended on a positive note, Paul Martin says retail is moving into a ""perfect storm"" in 2017. He warns that around April to July the hedging positions retailers took against currency fluctuations will begin to run out and the full force of the pound's devaluation since the Brexit vote will start to be felt through higher prices for imported goods. Multinationals will flex their muscles a little more over pricing imported goods for the UK market. And costs will be rising as business rates are revalued and the minimum wage rises. Inevitably, he says, retailers will have to look at what kind of price rises their customers can bear. ""We think it will be 5% to 8%. But that can vary substantially across sectors - you will find some cases where it will be 50%,"" he warns. In addition to Next, other retailers including John Lewis and Sainsbury's have warned about the uncertain impact of a weaker pound. While others have warned of price hikes, Ted Baker has said it will not raise prices this year The boss of fashion chain Ted Baker has vowed, however, that ""there won't be any price increases this year"". Chief executive Ray Kelvin told the Press Association: ""We were hedged for two years and we have one year left on that. We're a public company, we don't gamble with things like this, plus we also have a big dollar income."" The consensus though, is that consumer spending will be squeezed this year, and Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, says that will make it harder for retailers to generate growth. She also points to the uncertainty around what trading relationship the UK will have with the rest of the world once it leaves the EU. ""An announcement about that that doesn't seem favourable could have an impact on confidence,"" she says. But she adds that the mood among retailers is ""not one of doom and gloom, it's caution"".

E-made it,"This video can not be played The next big thing? Former Brazilian footballer Wendell Lira will never forget the day he beat Lionel Messi. It was a split second in front of the goalkeeper in a match in Brazil's lower league that changed Lira's life forever. Only 342 people were in the stadium that night for Goianesia v Atletico Goianiense, but Lira's superb goal captured on video travelled the world and became a hit, winning 2015'sFifa Puskas Award,externalfor the most beautiful goal scored in 2015. Lira was soon hired by a bigger football club and his career seemed on the rise. But in a turn of events he decided to retire from the sport at the age of 27, and is now playing video games instead. Even more surprisingly, he is making more money as an e-athlete than he ever did as a real footballer. ""I always dreamed of making a living as a video game player, but I never thought it would come true. But it did,"" he says. During a side event at the Fifa Award ceremony in Switzerland, footballers were challenged to play a match of EA Sports' Fifa game against the world champion. Most players, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, declined the offer. But Lira thought he had nothing to lose. To his own surprise, he beat the world champion 6-1. Before the award, he had become disenchanted with his own profession. Players in Brazil's top leagues can get good salaries and become millionaires if they are spotted by rich European clubs. But in the Brazilian lower leagues life is hard. Wendell Lira with his 2015 Puskas Award Lira spent the last few years earning 3,000 reais ($880; Â£700) per month in the weeks that he could find work. Some years he spent up to seven months unemployed. He had four serious injuries in his career. He had even retired from football and was working in his mother's restaurant when he got an invitation from Goianesia and decided to give the sport one last go. The goal he scored for the team earned him plaudits and fame. But just a few weeks after the glitz and glamour faded, he was again playing for a small club and suffering from all the same old problems - and having trouble paying his bills. ""People think that because I was a Puskas winner I had a huge salary. It was never the case."" But his good performance in the e-sport match in Switzerland did not go unnoticed. A sports marketing firm in the southern town of Porto Alegre saw potential in Wendell Lira and offered him a five-year contract as an e-athlete. He now makes money by playing in championships, hosting a YouTube channel with tips for players and selling sponsorship for his online programme. His channel has almost 250,000 subscribers and millions of views, and Lira says he is making well above his old salary. Making money playing on screen also needs hard training - something that will come as a surprise to many parents Brazil is one of the fastest growing markets for gaming in the world. A report by the consultancy Newzoo says Latin America is the second fastest growing region in electronic game revenues, after South East Asia. The region has 110 million gamers who spent $4.1bn in 2016 - some 20% more than the previous year. And video games are not only an entertainment option for players - people are now watching them in stadiums and on television too. Last year, more than 10,000 people attended the League of Legends final in a football stadium in Sao Paulo. The country's top TV sports channel is now broadcasting some tournaments live. Now traditional football clubs are looking for ways to cash in. Santos, the club that made Pele famous, has recently gone into partnership with an e-sports firm to sponsor teams. It now has e-athletes playing Rainbow Six and Counter Strike. Bruno Andrade manages the Santos Dexterity e-sports team Its marketing department fears that young audiences are flocking more to video games rather than to football clubs, and that they need to reach out to them in this new environment. Bruno Andrade, who manages the Santos Dexterity e-sports team, says it is a hard task to run the business. Money is still scarce - funding comes through cash prizes, online channels or sponsorship. Another challenge is to manage teenagers in a career that is not well-established yet. Santos Football Club provided its e-sports arm with a psychologist. ""Many people still don't understand that this could be a lasting career and they need professional help to guide them,"" says Andrade. Some top stars in the game are playing full-time and making six-figure sums. Brazil's top e-athlete, Gabriel ""Kami"" Bohm, is reportedly worth 1 million reais ($290,000; Â£230,000). There are teams that train and live together under one roof. But these are still rare cases. Most players are still struggling to make ends meet. Wendell Lira says his routine is very hard - he trains several hours every day to win cash prizes in online tournaments and stay relevant on YouTube. But, he says, it is still much easier than the gruelling world of football - where he had to deal with physical pain and long trips.

'An outstanding manager and one of the nicest men in the game',"Taylor took Watford from the Fourth Division to the First in five seasons in his first spell at the club, and into the Premier League via the play-offs in his second Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game. The reaction to Taylor's death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977. It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years. Listen again to a 5 live special: Tributes to Graham Taylor This video can not be played Obituary: Graham Taylor Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton. Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: ""You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I don't need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood."" Taylor's unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the manager's down-to-earth approach dovetailing with his chairman's lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated bySir Elton's heartfelt tribute. On trips abroad when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Sir Elton John posted an Instagram message to pay tribute to his ""brother"" Taylor's brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987. Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990. Taylor's methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as ""long ball"" football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylor's direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. This video can not be played Graham Taylor dies at 72 - His FA Cup Story This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Taylor's career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years. Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer. England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm. Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a ""turnip"" in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'The Impossible Job', which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam. The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on England's David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory. He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996. It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton. This video can not be played The day Graham Taylor resigned as England boss Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception. Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect. There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game.

5 live special: Graham Taylor tributes,"Ex-England manager Graham Taylor, 72, dies Taylor also managed Watford and Villa, among others Your memories of Taylor: #bbcsportsday Andy Donley and Shamoon Hafez It's been an emotional day for football, and that's been evident in the massive outpouring of affection for Graham Taylor, both within the sport and from you at home. You can read Phil McNulty's obituary to Taylorhere, or find a round-up of the day's eventshere. Thanks for joining us. Graham Taylor, RIP. Match of the Day Facebook Steve Aylward:R.I.P. Always remember you bringing Villa to Gresty Rd in the FA Cup and being 2-0 down at half-time and saying ""you got yourselves into this mess, now get yourself out of it"" - unfortunately for Crewe you did 2 - 3 R.I.P one of the nice guys of English football. John Swaby:Â I'm completely devastated. Best Lincoln manager ever. Nicest bloke you could wish to meet. Even when he was England manager he regularly came to events at Lincoln.Â Â Jeffery Hewerdine:Â I was at the match in 1972 when he took Lincoln into another league... we stormed the pitch and clapped him a standing ovation. Happy Days! Â Thank you to everybody who has shared their stories of Graham Taylor throughout the day. Graham Taylor tributes The tribute to Graham Taylor is rounding off on 5 live now, with current Burnley manager Sean Dyche paying tribute to a man who he came into contact with during his first job in management at Watford. ""He had an extremely thick skin, and he showed that by defending me on radio when I was a young manager as well. Things like that mean a lot,"" he said.Â ""To have that strength behind me when I was a young manager meant a lot. ""I'm forever in his debt for the help that he gave me.""

In a later tweet, Gary added: ""He made me his England captain and I will be eternally grateful to him for giving me that honour."" Graham Taylor tributes Daily Mirror Former Mirror journalist Harry Harris:""Graham got a really hard time by the media, but it was a media with teeth. That is now a pro-FA an anti-Fifa. There was a circulation war with The Sun but that existed before and after him. ""He suffered a vindictive personal attack but people are eulogising him today as a great person and manager. He did not cut it as an England manager though, he was out of his depth. Not since Taylor has an England manager has suffered the vitriol he did. On Swedes 2-1 Turnips headline:""It was quite funny but it is not funny if you are on the receiving end of it. He was brought up in media, he bend over backwards to help us but he did not have to deal with the forensic examinations that they have to deal with today. ""He was a bitter man towards journalists after that. What happened with England broke his heart and it never left him. He was very bitter about it but he was the right man at the time. It was very unfortunate what happened with refereeing decisions but he was a genuine football guy who did not deserve what he got from the media at the time."" Graham Taylor tributes ""Do I not like that..."" They're discussing the infamous Graham Taylor documentary on 5 live at the moment, in which he allowed himself and the England team to be filmed in the the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup. Our very own Tom Rostance took a look back on how it was allowed to happen - and just how funny it is in retrospect -here. Graham Taylor tributes John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator I met him first in the 1970s at Lincoln and then he went on to revolutionise Watford. Elton John had inteviewed Bobby Moore, who did not get the job and Graham did. He turned them into a family club and made sure players went to all the local functions. He led them to the FA Cup final, but he took them to Europe too. He pitted his wits against the best. I once fell out with Graham after asking him if he wanted to play more sophisticated football. He almost spat it back in my face. He had a fantastic career as a club manager and it is a tribute to him that BBC Radio 5 live, who he loved working for, are explaining what an influence he had on football. BBC Match of the Day Facebook Will Room:I remember seeing a clip of Taylor in the dugout during a match, and some fans behind him shouting out racial abuse to a player on the pitch and he went hell for leather against them - didn't hold back telling the fans to sit down and shut up basically. Back then it was probably normal for fans to think they could get away with stuff like that but Graham Taylor was definitely a decent man and respected everyone who played for him. Top bloke.Â Share your memories of Taylor via Twitter at #bbcsportsday and through the BBC Match of the Day Facebook page. Graham Taylor tributes John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator I was with him on 1 January, he had lunch with us in the boardroom and was in fantastic form.Â We were chatting and he reminded me of a story when my son was born in 1986. I had been at Watford the night before, in those days we did not all attend the births of our children, but I got a call from someone at the hospital saying I have had a son.Â I spoke to my wife later and told her I had already been given a call - it was Graham Taylor and that was the family man he was. Â Graham Taylor tributes John Murray5 live football correspondent He was such good company - a football man. When you spent time with him you realised he had so many other interests. He was steeped in football. He loved the game and everything about it. He was brilliant at being interested in other people and would always want to talk about football.Â Graham Taylor tributes John Murray5 live football correspondent It's going on 20 years now that he was working as a match summariser, and he was very loyal to the BBC.Â What was her like to work with as a commentator? I think if I'm going into a poor match and nothing is happening, is my summariser going to help me out? With Graham that was never a problem. He had such a wide range of interests, and he used to meander off talking about his family. He once told me all about his favourite holiday destination on-air! Graham was everything I hoped he would be before I met him. Graham Taylor tributes We've just had one Aston Villa fan - Aaron, who sits in the Holt End at Villa Park - telling Mark Pougatch on 5 live that he thinks Taylor should have a stand named after him for his achievements at the club. What do we think Villa fans? Or Lincoln and Watford supporters as well? Share your memories of Taylor via Twitter at #bbcsportsday and through the BBC Match of the Day Facebook page. Graham Taylor tributes BBC Radio 5 live Former Aston Villa winger Tony Daley:""We had just been relegated and things were not going great. Graham came in and said he was going to get us promoted. He asked if you wanted to be part of it and you gave him respect straight away. ""I was 18 and people were raving about me, he said if I don't buck my ideas up I would be down the road. He was the biggest influence of my career and like a father-figure to me. He brought my game on so much. ""What I liked about him, when things were going great he would put you down a peg, when things were not going great, he put an arm around you and made you feel invincible. ""He was a big believer in tactics and the advantages of set-pieces. He got his teams well organised and was into his stats. He was ahead of his time."" #bbcsportsday Dave Revell:ÂMet Graham Taylor at a charity day for Kit Aid. Had so much time for people and was always so nice. One of England's better managers. Glenn J Dann:ÂG.T. wasn't a bad England manager - just lack of quality at his disposal. He may have fared better with today's talent. Tom McCarron:ÂEpitomises true gent Graham Taylor.

Graham Taylor tributes BBC Radio 5 live Forward Watford striker Luther Blissett:""It was a shock to hear Graham's passing, I can't believe it has happened. ""To be able to talk about somebody, it comes fairly easy when it is for someone like Graham. He used to do some of his team-talks in the freezing cold on a Friday. Everybody would go 'yeh, yeh' and it would go on for 20 minutes. He paid attention to details and that is why he had so much success. ""Whoever he brought to Watford, he wanted to know about the person. Were they married? He was a big family man, people and community was a big in his upbringing, that was the same as a manager. He could tell the mood players were in and them manage them. ""When AC Milan came in, we spoke about it. Even at 1am, he came and took em to one side and said, 'the club are happy with everything, but if you are not, we will tear up everything and go back to training'.

Here's what the music legend had to say earlier about his friend's death. ""I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear about Graham's passing,"" he said. ""He was like a brother to me. We shared an unbreakable bond since we first met.Â ""We went on an incredible journey together and it will stay with me forever.

Can Cypriots heal their divided island?,"Abdullah Cangil, who was forced to emigrate from southern Cyprus to the north, says he is happy to hand back his house Abdullah Cangil is a 66-year-old Turkish Cypriot, living in Morphou - a border town on the divided island of Cyprus. His three-bedroom house is surrounded by orange and lemon trees. The chirping of birds can be heard all around the garden. He says he planted the trees here himself, as he reaches to one of them to grab a few mandarins to offer me. Mr Cangil moved to this house in 1974, after Turkey invaded Cyprus in response to a coup aiming to unite the island with Greece. This was followed by a population exchange. Around that time, 165,000 Greek Cypriots were displaced, while about 40,000 Turkish Cypriots were uprooted in total in inter-communal violence in the 1960s and the population transfer in 1975. Abdullah Cangil was one of those who left his house behind. After 24 years in Paphos, a southern Cyprus town, he was forced to emigrate to the north. ""A Greek Cypriot family lives in our house in Paphos and we live in a Greek Cypriot family's house here,"" he says. ""We all see each other, we became very good friends in time."" But what if he needs to hand his current home to its previous owners? ""I never felt attached to this house. I always knew one day I would need to leave it behind. It is its real owners' right to live here,"" he replies. ""The future of my grandsons, that is more important than a house. Peace is more important. I don't want my children to live the wars, the troubles that we have gone through. It is much more important to have peace than to move from one house to another."" Greek Cypriots from the town of Morphou stage a protest outside the presidential palace in Nicosia Morphou, or Guzelyurt as it is called by Turkish Cypriots, is one of the thorny issues at the peace talks under way in the Swiss town of Geneva. Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades has warned that there can be no deal without a full return of the town, while some on the Turkish Cypriot side say that is out of the question. Although the talks in Geneva are labelled as the most intense effort in more than a decade to reunite the divided island of Cyprus, there is slow progress and the hopes for a breakthrough are already dimming. But the two sides - for the very first time in the long history of Cyprus negotiations - have presented their respective maps of the future internal boundaries of a federated Cyprus. The details of the maps are yet unclear, but it is expected that the territory under Turkish Cypriot control could shrink from its current 37% to just under 30%. The fate of Morphou remains to be seen too, as emotions still run high on both sides of the island over the matters of territorial exchange and compensation for lost property. Turkey PM boosts Cyprus peace deal hopes Analysis: Hope for a fresh settlement in Cyprus Cyprus country profile But that is not the only hurdle in these negotiations. The foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey and Britain, guarantor powers of Cyprus's independence, are scheduled in Geneva on Thursday to discuss the security concerns within a possible deal - another challenging topic. Turkey has about 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus. Greece and the Greek Cypriot government strongly contest their presence and demand all of them are pulled out - hardly a demand Turkey would be happy to meet. In general, Turkish Cypriots, fearful of past experiences of being targeted by Greek Cypriot nationalists, also want Turkish guarantees to continue. The wounds of the past are hard to heal in both communities and there is a mutual distrust of one another. Bird droppings cover seats inside the old Nicosia airport, now located in the UN-controlled buffer zone that separates the north and south of Cyprus One place that stands as a monument to that distrust and how to overcome it lies within the UN-controlled buffer zone that divides Cyprus along ethnic lies. The Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) located here is a bi-communal body established in 1981 with the participation of the UN. Its aim is to recover, identify and return the remains of the people who went missing during the atrocities mainly taking place in 1963-64 and 1974. According to a list agreed by the leaders of Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities, 2,001 people have been identified as missing persons - though it is believed that the number could be much higher. Around 500 of them are Turkish Cypriots and the rest Greek Cypriots - 1:3 being the exact proportion of the respective communities to each other. The first missing person was exhumed in 2007 and since then about 750 people have been identified, their remains returned to their families. Over a thousand sites have been dug until now, and excavations are still being carried out. The remains of 25 people have been uncovered in the past few months alone The Committee on Missing Persons aims to return the bones of the missing to their families Rania Michail is in the team of anthropologists digging at a previously Orthodox cemetery in Morphou. Since they started searching this place six months ago, they have managed to excavate 25 missing people's remains, she tells me - 12 soldiers, 12 old women and 1 person's general body parts. ""Sometimes it gets difficult emotionally. Especially if we find the remains of a child,"" Rania says. ""The first time that I saw remains five years ago, it was the most shocking moment of my life. I was really upset. That night I could not sleep. But then I got used to it. I have excavated over 100 bodies - women, soldiers, kids - both in the north and in the south of the island."" At the CMP's headquarters in the UN-controlled buffer zone, the anthropologists study the remains carefully, trying to reconstruct them and to identify those killed. Skulls and bones are laid on top of tables along with whatever was found lying with the remains - a pair of socks, a piece of underwear, a lighter, or a picture of a loved one. ""What we do here is very important for achieving peace in Cyprus,"" says Uyum Vehit, an anthropologist. ""Almost every single family has missing persons. If they don't receive the remains, and if they don't have proper graves, they can't have a closure."" Kyriacos Solomi lost his younger brother, George, in the violence At his home on the Greek side of the ""Green Line"" line in Nicosia, Kyriacos Solomi, 68, still waits for the remains of his younger brother, George, who was killed on the front line 42 years ago. ""He was a very peaceful man. He liked mixing with people, enjoying life, peaceful activities. He was a nice, healthy, good-looking young man, 24 years old,"" he says while trying to hold back the tears when he looks at his brother's picture in his hand. ""This is a very deep wound. It may close one day but a big scar will stay there forever."" Despite having lost his brother, Mr Solomi still believes in peace - but he doubts whether it can ever be reached in Cyprus. ""There is no other way to survive on this island. We fight for peace. I know the clock cannot go back, the lives will not come back. ""But I don't think peace will come here. Maybe in the next generations, if they can change the textbooks that spread hate instead of love. ""Listen to the TV, listen to the church: they are spreading hate. I don't think we can live peacefully with hatred on this island,"" he says. This video can not be played For more than 40 years Cyprus has been a divided island.

Is the NHS getting more than it wanted?,"The claim:The NHS is being given more money than it asked for. Reality Check verdict:The amount that the NHS in England is being given over this Parliament is at the bottom end of the range that it asked for. It doesn't take into account the knock-on effects of shortfalls in other areas such as social care. ""We asked the NHS to work out what it needed over the next five years in terms of... the funding it would need,"" Prime Minister Theresa May told Sky News on Sunday. ""We gave them more funding than they required."" But NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens denied this on Wednesday. We are only talking about the NHS in England because health is a devolved power, although increased spending on the NHS in England is reflected in the overall amount of funding allocated to devolved governments. The government says it has given the NHS in England an extra Â£10bn over the life of this Parliament, a more generous offer than the Â£8bn Mr Stevens requested in 2014. The Â£10bn is NHS England's extra budget for the period 2014-15 to 2020-21, so it covers six years, not five - it is actually Â£8.4bn over the five-year Parliament. And as Mr Stevens pointed out, the document in which he set out how much cash the health service needed was called the Five Year Forward View, not the six-year forward view. But still, Â£8bn was what the NHS asked for, so shouldn't that be enough? Mr Stevens has made clear that when he mentioned the Â£8bn figure, that was the minimum amount needed just to plug the funding gap. But this figure is not enough to keep pace with rising demand, improve services or accommodate plans for seven-day services. Speaking to NHS leaders last June, he said: ""Let's not rewrite history. ""In the Forward View, we actually said that the National Health Service would need between Â£8bn and Â£21bn by 2020 in order to sustain and improve."" So government has given the NHS funding within the range of what it asked for, but it is at the very bottom of this range. And we know demand is rising. Between 2004-05 and 2015-16, attendances at accident and emergency departments went up by almost 30%, while over a similar period, the number of people aged 85 and over increased by 31%. NHS trusts also finished the last financial year (2015-16) Â£2.4bn in the red, so some of the extra money is being used just to plug gaps. On top of this, the government used a different calculation compared with previous years when it came up with the Â£8.4bn figure, arguably making it look more generous. In the past when it talked about this funding, figures referred to the whole health budget and now they are referring to only NHS England. This does not include things such as training, building upkeep or public health, including smoking cessation and some sexual health and obesity management services, which now fall on general local authority budgets. All of these areas may face cuts that could pass on extra costs to the NHS, meaning the Â£8.4bn will not go as far. Also falling to local councils rather than the NHS is the funding of social care. When there is not enough social care available, this piles pressure on to hospitals. For example, elderly people who cannot access the right care in the community are more likely to end up in A&E after falling or becoming dehydrated, for example. Overstretched care services are also part of the reason people end up staying in hospital beds longer than they need to. Figures published on Thursday showed there were almost 200,000 lost bed days in November 2016 because of delays in discharging people into the community. So looking at the NHS budget in isolation does not tell the whole story. The NHS might have more money, but if it has to be spent on keeping people in hospital because social care is unavailable, then it is not going towards treating more people or improving care. The House of Commons Health Committee have worked out that it is a Â£4.5bn increase once you factor in the whole health budget in the way that it used to be calculated.

10 things we learnt from Trump press event,"Donald Trump has held his first news conference in five months, with nine days to go before he takes the oath and assumes power at the White House. While his fury at the allegations concerning his ties to Russia made the headlines, there was plenty more covered. So what did we learn? His sons, Donald and Eric, will run the Trump Organization, Mr Trump said in a long-awaited announcement concerning his business interests. His lawyer Sheri Dillon also said: No input from Trump in decisions Ethics adviser appointed to management team All pending deals have been terminated - 30 plus No new foreign deals will be made US deals will be vetted She also turned to the constitution's ""emoluments clause"" which bans government officials from taking money from foreign governments. People have wondered if foreign officials staying at Trump hotels would mean he was in breach. She said no. But she said he would donate foreign payments to the Treasury anyway. However, the head of the Office of Government Ethics launched a scathing attack on the overall Trump plan, saying it does not go far enough to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Other ethics experts seem to agree. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher:Mr Trump has spent his entire life building his business empire, and he seems reluctant to let it go entirely, ethical concerns notwithstanding. While he says he's stepping away from the business, his decision not to relinquish ownership and his only transfer management to his children will likely not satisfy many of his critics. Trump hands over business empire to sons The president-elect suggested the US intelligence agencies are to blame for the unsubstantiated allegations that he paid for Russian prostitutes and fostered close relations between his campaign team and the Kremlin. ""I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out there... That's something that Nazi Germany would have done."" The top US spy, James Clapper, later hit back, saying the leak was not from the US intelligence community. AZ:Wednesday was only the latest broadside Mr Trump has fired against a US intelligence community that he believes is trying to undermine the legitimacy of the presidency. His targets feel threatened as well, so this is far from the final exchange. Angry Trump blasts 'fake news disgrace' He went further than he has before in identifying Russia as the culprit behind hacks of Democratic Party emails, but still carried a caveat. ""As far as hacking, I think it's Russia. But we also get hacked by other countries and other people."" AZ:While Mr Trump was finally willing to acknowledge Russian involvement in 2016 election hacking, he still couched criticism in terms of a larger problem that involves other nations, like China. Mr Trump clearly feels much more comfortable criticising China than he does Vladimir Putin and Russia. Mr Trump said he plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as soon as his health secretary pick is confirmed. That could be the same week, the same day or even the same hour, he said. But it's not clear whether the Republican party will be able to rally around a new plan. AZ:While Mr Trump has set a tight timeline for repeal and replacement of Obamacare, it will be a heavy lift for a Congress that still is uncertain on what it should do - or the political fallout it could suffer for doing it. Can Obamacare be repealed? This video can not be played Donald Trump said the information was 'fake' The man who launched his presidential campaign with the condemnation of Mexican immigrants as criminals shows no signs of wavering in his plan to build wall on the southern border. AZ:For Mr Trump, it's not a matter of if Mexico is going to pay for the border wall (not fence, he emphasised), it's when - and he predicts it will happen in less than a year. ""There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States."" AZ:Now we know a bit more about how he will try to foot the bill for the wall - through a tax, which might be easier than asking the Mexican government to cough up a cheque. Asked about filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court, he said he has a list of 20 and will put one of them up within his first two weeks. ""It will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it's one of the reasons I got elected."" AZ:While the Supreme Court wasn't a top issue for many American voters, it was likely an important factor in keeping evangelical conservatives in Mr Trump's column. His pick will likely reward their faith. ""We have to get our drug industry coming back,"" he said. We need to ""create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they're getting away with murder,"" he added. After the press conference, Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders expressed his full agreement. ""Pharma does get away with murder. Literally murder. People die because they can't get the prescription drugs they need."" AZ:Talking about using the power of government negotiation to reduce drug prices is a regular talking point for Democrats, but Mr Trump's interest in taking on big pharmaceutical companies probably comes as a bit of a shock to his Republican colleagues. Mr Trump cracked a joke when he said he could not have done some of the more salacious things alleged in the intelligence dossier. ""Does anyone believe that story? I'm a germophobe, by the way."" It has long been part of media folklore that he is averse to physical contact and once passed hand-sanitiser to journalists. AZ:Back when Mr Trump was giving regular press conferences, his answers were frequently peppered with quirky non-sequiturs or comments that would never come out of the mouth of a traditional politician. It seems like President Trump will stick to that script. ""I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well - Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.

What makes Marine Le Pen far right?,"Marine Le Pen has been increasingly looking to the centre and left for votes She described Britain's vote for Brexit as the most important event since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Donald Trump's US presidential victory as ""an additional stone in the building of a new world"". Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front (FN), is fighting to achieve a similar earthquake in France in the presidential elections in 2017. But with her increasing appeal to the centre and the left of French politics, how much can she really be characterised as far-right? Marine Le Pen is the youngest daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the FN and a convicted racist, who last year repeated an old anti-Semitic slur that the Nazi gas chambers were ""a detail of history"". Having grown up in a political home, accompanying him to meetings from the age of 13, Marine Le Pen was always going to struggle to shake off the far-right label. But she did denounce her father's comments in 2015, and effectively expelled him from the party. While her father was leader, the FN was the party that wanted to deport three million foreigners, the party of Holocaust denial and xenophobia. But under Marine Le Pen the FN began to distance itself from such controversial issues. ""Damned by her father"" - Marine Le Pen managed to get her far-right father off the political stage after his remarks about the Holocaust Such efforts at detoxification have proved successful, with polls suggesting support for the FN climbing from 18% in 2010 to about 24% today. Nonetheless, when voters are questioned they still place the FN and Ms Le Pen ""way more to the right than other parties"", says Nonna Mayer, expert in racism and the FN at Sciences Po university. Where does she go from here in her pursuit of a detoxified party? The FN has traditionally been a male, blue-collar-dominated party, and the leader needs to target women, says Dr Mayer. So Ms Le Pen has softened her approach to women's rights, and even sees herself as a quasi-feminist. In fact, Dr Mayer argues, in many respects Ms Le Pen is more socially liberal than much of the mainstream right - something that has caused divisions within her own party. National Front: Far right or hard left? Le Pen rails against globalisation The 2017 National Front manifesto renews its commitment to a massive reduction in legal immigration. Ms Le Pen argues French citizenship should be ""either inherited or merited"". As for illegal immigrants, they ""have no reason to stay in France, these people broke the law the minute they set foot on French soil"". But if that is a far-right stance, it is not very different from that of centre-right candidate Francois Fillon - who when first elected as the Republican candidate enjoyed a small advantage over Ms Le Pen in polls but has since been damaged by claims of improper use of state funds. ""We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum,"" he says. In a world where the centre is shifting to the right, and the right is shifting to the centre, the lines are getting blurred. What now for France's left and far right? Le Pen stalks French centre-right contest Guide to nationalist parties in Europe The two are now competing for some of the same voters. While Mr Fillon is regarded as appealing more to the ""respectable"" middle classes, Marine Le Pen is claiming to speak for ""all people"", and increasingly appealing to a wider electorate, even Muslim voters in the French suburbs. Marine Le Pen increasingly claims to speak ""in the name of the people"" However, in December she upped the ante by announcing that she would end free education for the children of undocumented immigrants, though this did not appear as a pledge in the party's manifesto. ""If you come to our country, don't expect to be taken care of, to be looked after, that your children will be educated without charge,"" she said in a speech in Paris. And, more threateningly, ""playtime is over"". Long before the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015, Marine Le Pen made a link between immigration and militant Islamism. In the immediate aftermath, she proposed to ""expel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil"" and to strip dual-nationality Muslims with extremist views of their French citizenship, a view traditionally associated with the far right. In an unprecedented move, those ideas were endorsed both by Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls and by President Francois Hollande, before eventually being dropped. Many of her views have been echoed by Francois Fillon too. Mr Fillon, a devout Catholic, described radical Islam as a ""totalitarianism like the Nazis"". Catholics, Protestants and Jews ""don't denounce the values of the Republic,"" he said, indicating that was not the case with Islam. ""The clear blue water between the FN and the other parties has been disappearing and disappearing,"" says James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University. The National Front is to the right of the Republicans on law and order issues, says Nonna Mayer. Its 2017 election manifesto includes upping police numbers and powers and creating 40,000 new prison places. There is no mention in this manifesto of the FN's previous pledge to restore the death penalty, an issue that divides the party's core supporters from the mainstream. Polls suggest 60% of FN voters are in favour, compared with 28% of mainstream-right and 11% of left-wing voters. Treatment of immigrants in France is probably the standout, far-right policy of Marine Le Pen's FN. And it is central to the party's platform. Jobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to French nationals before they get to ""foreigners"". The centre of gravity of French politics may have shifted to the right. But no other party has adopted favouritism across the social services - and it could breach the law. Marine Le Pen's niece tweets this: ""Fillon is for the national birth right, for family reunion, against restoration of the borders, against national priority"" ""She is upholding a policy that not only is thought by constitutional experts to be unconstitutional, but has been judged by the law to be unlawful,"" says Prof Shields. In 1998, a National Front mayor, Catherine Megret, tried to implement a new policy that would give a family allowance to French or EU families, but not to other foreign families. ""Did it stand up in court? No,"" says Prof Shields. But, he says, so-called nativism remains central in Ms Le Pen's platform. Marine Le Pen appeals to French voters fed up with mainstream politics, but there is nothing far right about that. If she wins the presidency in May, she has promised an EU referendum in France within six months of taking office. And the UK's vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has provided the template. Portraying herself as beyond the establishment, she has championed public services - for non-foreigners - and presented herself as a protector of workers and farmers in the face of ""wild and anarchic globalisation"". This video can not be played Marine Le Pen: 'Trump made the impossible possible' ""She's managing to get these approval ratings by doing a Trump,"" says Prof Shields. But here the lines are blurred too: left-wing parties are playing the anti-establishment, anti-globalisation card as well. But what sets her European views apart from the rest of the French right is the company she keeps. The FN has strong ties with the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), Austria's Freedom Party (FPOe), Belgium's Flemish Interest (VB), Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Italian Northern League (LN). They are all part of the FN-led Europe of Nations and Freedom grouping in the European Parliament and are either right-wing populist or, in the case of the FPOe, far right. Marine Le Pen associates herself with other right-wing leaders in Europe, for example Geert Wilders of the Dutch PVV Geert Wilders, of leader of the Dutch PVV, wants to ban the Koran. The Italian Northern League's leader Matteo Salvini is known for his praise of fascist leader Benito Mussolini. These views are toxic to the political right in Europe, and many centre-right parties have said they will not form coalitions with them.

England hammered by India A in warm-up,"Eoin Morgan has faced only seven deliveries on the tour so far Tour match, Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai England 282 (48.5 overs):Bairstow 64, Hales 51 India A 283-4 (39.4 overs):Rahane 91 India A won by six wickets Scorecard (external),external England were heavily beaten by India A in their second and final warm-up match before the one-day international series begins on Sunday. After Jonny Bairstow made 64 and Alex Hales 51, the tourists slipped from 116-1 to 211-9 - both Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler were out first ball. They needed last-wicket pair Adil Rashid and David Willey to reach 282. India A coasted in the chase, Ajinkya Rahane's 91 getting them home with more than 10 overs to spare. Stay or go? The decision facing Alastair Cook This setback comes after England beat a differentIndia A line-up by three wickets on Tuesday. It also throws up further questions over the top-order batting. The regular top four would comprise Hales, Jason Roy - who was unlucky to be bowled when a part of his helmet fell on to the bails - Joe Root and Morgan. Root has not played in the warm-ups after arriving late because of the birth of his son, while captain Morgan, returning to the side after missing the tour of Bangladesh over security fears, has made only three runs in two innings. Meanwhile, Sam Billings made 93 in the first match and Bairstow pressed his claim here. Morgan is not the only man short of form. Moeen Ali has made just one run in his two innings and was the third of three wickets to fall in the space of eight balls. Rashid, who shared 71 for the 10th wicket with Willey, served up a succession of short balls in seven overs of leg spin that went for 51 - and not one of England's bowlers managed an economy rate of under six. BBC Sport's Tim Peach in Mumbai The manner of captain Eoin Morgan and vice-captain Jos Buttler's dismissals epitomised this latest England middle-order collapse in India. Both were caught and bowled, first ball, prodding easy catches back to the bowler, misjudging the pace of the wicket. England will be much more pleased with their top order, however. Not only did Hales and Bairstow both reach half-centuries, but Jason Roy was looking in fine form before his unfortunate dismissal. He stood his ground for what seemed an age, unable to quite work out how the bails had been dislodged. We're often told of how deep England bat, and this was proved by a carefree 70-run partnership between Rashid and Willey, who helped make the target more respectable. Stay or go?

Dominic O'Connell: M&S - good news finally?,"Marks and Spencer has turned out to be this year's surprise Christmas package. In a festive season where most of our big retailers did better than expected, M&S stood out, finally shrugging off its clothing sales hoodoo. Clothing sales have been in decline - and often sharp decline - for the past five years, with the exception of one positive quarter two years ago. Over Christmas, however, like-for-like sales were up 2.3%, although the company was quick to point out that 1.5% of that was down to how Christmas fell, which meant there were five extra trading days compared to the relevant period a year earlier. Even so, a 0.8% increase is not to be sneezed at, and is evidence perhaps that the back-to-basics reforms of chief executive Steve Rowe, which include hundreds of job losses at head office and the closure of most of the international stores, is having some effect. M&S beats Christmas sales forecast Tesco hails 'strong progress' One good quarter doesn't make a revival, but a halt to the seemingly inexorable decline will give shareholders encouragement. Retail analysts say Mr Rowe's formula - a concentration on the basics - is a welcome contrast to the recent past, where management introduced eye-catching fashion and made mis-steps online. The real test will be at the next quarterly update, where the calendar is against Mr Rowe - just as he benefited at Christmas, he misses out next time. If he can turn in another positive number on clothing, there will be substance to the M&S revival. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of John Lewis Elsewhere, there was good news tempered with caution about the coming year. This was best expressed at the John Lewis Partnership, which reported like for like sales growth of just under 3% at both the department store chain and the grocery business, Waitrose. Profits for the full year are likely to be up, but Sir Charlie Mayfield, the partnership's chairman, took the unusual step of warning staff their bonuses would be smaller than last year. The culprits? The pressure caused by a weaker pound and the need to invest heavily in new products.

Was Buzzfeed right on Trump dossier?,"Donald Trump has criticised the decision to publish the dossier Was Buzzfeed right to publish theTrump dossier?,external That comes down to editorial judgement, which is to news what eggs are to an omelette - the essential ingredient. That said, I opened this post with a question which I will not answer - partly because I work for the BBC and it is not my place to pass judgement on other news organisations' editorial calls and partly because those editorial calls are subjective. But as BBC media editor, and as a former editor of The Independent who had to make thousands of these calls, often against tight deadlines and under great pressure from the subjects of our stories, I want to explore some of the considerations that we editors have to make. Hopefully that will illuminate the hugely controversial decision made this week by Buzzfeed. The story behind the allegations When presidents and spies fall out Press event a theatre of the absurd 10 things Trump told us and why Editorial judgement is ultimately a moral activity. It is an exercise in selection - which stories, facts, claims, pictures, words, ideas to publish, and which to leave out - that relies on several smaller judgements. These include: the importance you attach to veracity; your own political persuasion; a sense of your audience's interest and - outside the BBC and unfortunately more common now the news business model is under such strain - a consideration of the commercial implications of publishing particular things. The rectitude of all moral activity or actions - editorial judgement included - can be analysed along three criteria: The intentions that motivate an action The consequences that follow The consistency of the action with certain abiding principles. Let's look at Buzzfeed's decision to publish the dossier in terms of intentions and consequences. Some people will argue that - whether you agree with it or not - there is a coherent case for putting information in the public domain even if you are not 100% certain it is true. Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief, hasspoken eloquently,externalabout how, in our digital era, publishers are no longer gatekeepers of information who demand to be trusted, arguing that Buzzfeed is simply a distributor. His second argument is that because this publication was being circulated widely among government officials, it had tremendous news value and therefore it was in the public interest to put it in the public domain with plenty of caveats so readers could make up their own minds. Buzzfeed does not share Mr Trump's political view I know from personal experience that, if you are a digital publisher whose content is free, you mainly make money from advertising, which is related to traffic and which you are under immense pressure to generate. This ultimately commercial imperative can - and does - influence the editorial judgement of many publishers. But let us be charitable to Buzzfeed and say that commercial considerations did not influence this editorial decision. Buzzfeed has a young audience and often publishes journalism associated with the political Left, unlike Trump whose most stable constituency is older voters on the Right. It is reasonable to conclude that one reason Buzzfeed published this dossier about Mr Trump is that it calculated it could harm someone it does not like. So Buzzfeed, having put traffic considerations aside, and being antithetical to some of the things Mr Trump stands for, calculated that the document, which had potentially huge implications for the incoming president, deserved to be seen in its entirety by readers who want access to information. That covers the intentions, but what of the consequences? Huge traffic for this article must have been one consequence. Another is that Buzzfeed, as a powerful international brand, is now clearly associated with a willingness to publish information it knows could be false. Another consequence is of course that the information contained in the dossier, some of it untrue, much of it not corroborated, is now in the public domain we call cyberspace. Perhaps citizens across the globe are digesting it to better understand the incoming president. Finally, life has been made harder for other news organisations, such as CNN, who Trump targeted in his remarkable press conference. They have now been conflated with Buzzfeed under Trump's pernicious umbrella term ""fake news"". Buzzfeed could reasonably say it is not its job to secure access to Mr Trump for CNN - and in any case the president-elect was not exactly friendly with the mainstream media before the dossier's publication. It will be for editors and citizens everywhere to decide, in balancing Buzzfeed's intentions with the (largely foreseeable) consequences, whether it made a correct editorial judgement. That in turn depends on your moral position - your commitment to truth and so on. What really interests me is that Mr Smith is saying that the digital revolution has redefined journalism, creating publishers who are prepared to put lots of information into the public domain without verifying it. Julian Assange's Wikileaks has put huge amounts of information into the public domain There is a difference, however, between Wikileaks, who do that sort of thing, and what most journalists understand their role to be: corroborating information before making selections as to what should be published. In a sense, Mr Smith's position is an argument against journalism, in that being gatekeepers who curate and edit the world is precisely what many hacks believe their role to be. Just as traditional media included many different types of publisher - tabloids v broadsheets, for example - so new, digital media include those who exhaustively check their facts and proceed with caution and those who are prepared to publish unverified allegations because they think the public should know. The BBC is in the former camp, as my colleague Paul Wood argued in hisexcellent blog. We work very hard to verify claims before publishing them: so much so that there are always big stories we know about that we cannot use, because we haven't got sufficiently solid sourcing. Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg hastalked about this,external- and I can certainly relate to it. Together with Mr Trump, this controversy helps to illuminate how fast the media is changing - and how it affects all our lives.

What does post-truth mean for a philosopher?,"AC Grayling says a post-truth world threatens the ""fabric of democracy"" ""Post-truth"" has come to describe a type of campaigning that has turned the political world upside down. Fuelled by emotive arguments rather than fact-checks, it was a phrase that tried to capture the gut-instinct, anti-establishment politics that swept Donald Trump and Brexit supporters to victory. Oxford Dictionaries made it the word of the year, defining it as where ""objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"". But what does this new world mean for academics and scientists whose whole purpose is trying to establish objective facts? AC Grayling, public thinker, master of the New College of the Humanities, and Remain campaigner, views the post-truth world with undisguised horror. The philosopher, awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours, warns of the ""corruption of intellectual integrity"" and damage to ""the whole fabric of democracy"". But where does he think the post-truth world has come from? ""The world changed after 2008,"" says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial crash has been shaped by a ""toxic"" growth in income inequality. As well as the gap between rich and poor, he says a deep sense of grievance has grown among middle-income families, who have faced a long stagnation in earnings. With a groundswell of economic resentment, he says, it is not difficult to ""inflame"" emotions over issues such as immigration and to cast doubt on mainstream politicians. Another key ingredient in the post-truth culture, says Prof Grayling, has been the rise of social media. It's not the soundbite any more, but the ""i-bite"", he says, where strong opinion can shout down evidence. ""The whole post-truth phenomenon is about, 'My opinion is worth more than the facts.' It's about how I feel about things. ""It's terribly narcissistic. It's been empowered by the fact that you can publish your opinion. You used to need a pot of paint and a balaclava to publish your opinion, if you couldn't get a publisher. Prof Grayling says the idea of post-truth has its roots in the financial crash ""But all you need now is an iPhone. Everyone can publish their opinion - and if you disagree with me, it's an attack on me and not my ideas. ""The fact that you can muscle your way on to the front row and be noticed becomes a kind of celebrity."" ""Fake news"" on social media became part of the post-election debate in the US - and Prof Grayling warns of an online culture that can't distinguish between fact and fiction. ""Put the words 'did the' into Google and one of the first things you see is, 'Did the Holocaust happen?' and the links will take you to claims that it didn't,"" he says. This process is ""corrosive of our public conversation and our democracy"" and he warns of a culture where a few claims on Twitter can have the same credibility as a library full of research. Has the success of Donald Trump changed the rules of campaigning? Appropriately for a philosopher, he identifies post-modernism and relativism as the intellectual roots ""lurking in the background"" of post-truth. ""Everything is relative. Stories are being made up all the time - there is no such thing as the truth. You can see how that has filtered its way indirectly into post-truth."" He says this has unintentionally ""opened the door"" to a type of politics untroubled by evidence. But hasn't this always been part of the battle of ideas? ""Post-truth"" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2016 Prof Grayling tells the story of Adlai Stevenson, the unsuccessful liberal contender in the 1952 US presidential election, who was told: ""Mr Stevenson, every thinking person in America is going to vote for you. And he said: 'Great, but I need a majority.'"" But the philosopher argues that there has been a significant shift beyond the boundaries of election spinning and into something fundamentally different. He places his argument into a historical perspective, saying the international landscape is more like the volatile, intolerant era before World War Two. ""There are some really uncomfortable parallels with the 1930s,"" he says. ""These guys have realised you don't need facts, you just lie.""

Trump's 'dirty dossier' and the British spy,"Pictures of a defiant Donald Trump holding forth during his news conference on Wednesday feature on many front pages. It was, says the Guardian, a combative performance as Mr Trumpunleashed a firestorm,externalof invective against news organisations and US intelligence agencies. The Financial Times claims his stanceescalates an already tense relationship,externalwith an intelligence leadership that believes his election was abetted by a foreign power, Russia. The Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror all lead on reports that a former MI6 agent who was based in Russia hasgone into hiding,externalafter being named as theperson behind the dossier,externalof lurid claims about the president-elect. They say Christopher Steele is ""terrified for his safety"",fearing retribution from Moscow,external. ""Oh to be a sketchwriter in America"",external- declares Quentin Letts in the Mail. ""Mr Trump is a politician, Jim, but not as we know it,"" he writes. ""He doesn't do wriggling and lawyerly evasions. He doesn't do dainty detours or  (ridiculous thought) charm.

The Sun speaks of""open war with Number 10"",externalafter Mr Stevens fired off what it calls ""a series of barbs"" at the prime minister when he appeared before MPs. The paper calls it an ""unhealthy spat which helps no-one"" - the last thing we need, it says, is the distraction of a row as those at the top pass the buck. The Daily Telegraph calls for thepolitics to be taken out of NHS funding,external; it argues that there must be a willingness to consider alternative ways of bringing money into the system without it being denounced as ""privatising"" the service.

Ex-England manager Taylor dies at 72,"This video can not be played Obituary: Graham Taylor Former England manager Graham Taylor has died at the age of 72. As a club manager, Taylor led Watford from the Fourth Division to runners-up in the old First Division in five years, and to the 1984 FA Cup final. He took Aston Villa to second in the First Division, returning to Watford and Villa after his spell in charge of the national side, and managing Wolves. He became England boss in 1990 but resigned in 1993 after the teamfailed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. Taylor later became a renowned pundit for BBC Sport. A family statement said: ""With the greatest sadness, we have to announce that Graham passed away at his home early this morning of a suspected heart attack. ""The family are devastated by this sudden and totally unexpected loss."" Obituary: 'Perhaps now his work will get the credit it deserves' 'I love you Graham, I'll miss you very much' - Sir Elton John pays tribute Listen: Archive interview: Graham Taylor on 'View from the Boundary' Watford will hold a minute's applause in honour of their former manager before their home Premier League game against Middlesbrough on Saturday, and their players will wear black armbands. The EFL said a minute's applause will be held before this weekend's league fixtures, while clubs will have the option of wearing black armbands. Tributes have been pouring in, including from musicianSir Elton John,who owned Watford during both of Taylor's spells at the club. ""I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear about Graham's passing. He was like a brother to me,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""We shared an unbreakable bond since we first met. We went on an incredible journey together and it will stay with me forever. ""He took my beloved Watford from the depths of the lower leagues to uncharted territory and into Europe. We have become a leading English club because of his managerial wisdom and genius.""

""Graham will always have a place of honour in our history books for his achievements while at the helm,"" the club added. Football Association chairman Greg Clarkesaid: ""He was a hugely popular and respected figure in the game, not just in English football but international circles as well. ""I know Graham was very proud of his time as England manager and it was always great to see him at football grounds across the country. ""He had an exceptional knowledge and a love for the game that never diminished over the years. He will be much missed by us all at Wembley and St George's Park."" Match of the Day pundit and former England strikerAlan Shearerwas given his international debut by Taylor.

He started as a very young man of 28, having suffered a career-ending injury as a player. ""He was the natural choice to become the England manager when he did and this was the pinnacle of a hugely successful career. ""I have very fond memories of Graham. He was approachable, open and honest.  If he could help you in any way, he always would."" Howard Wilkinson,chairman of the LMA - of which Taylor was the first president, said: ""Football has lost one of its greatest servants and our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Rita, his daughters Joanne and Karen, and the rest of his family."" Much of Taylor's work as a pundit at the BBC was carried out for BBC Radio 5 live, and controller Jonathan Wall said: ""His colleagues loved working with him, and for our listeners he was a much-loved pundit. He leaves us with wonderful warm memories and so many stories. Our thoughts are with his family at this sad time."" Archive: Media treated me like dirt after England - Taylor Archive: Taylor told me to stick to cricket - Botham This video can not be played Graham Taylor dies at 72 - His FA Cup Story Taylor started out as a player and, after coming through the youth ranks with Scunthorpe, was a defender at Grimsby and Lincoln City. He became manager at Lincoln in 1972 aged 28, and led them to the old Fourth Division title in 1975-76 before joining Watford. In his first spell as Hornets boss between 1977 and 1987, Taylor took the club to the top flight and they finished second to Liverpool in 1983. He was appointed by Villa in 1987 and, after leading them to promotion into the top tier, took them to second in 1990. His exploits led to his appointment as England manager, but he had a turbulent spell in charge of the national team as they failed to make it out of the group at Euro 92 and did not qualify for the World Cup in the United States two years later. Taylor's return to club management came with a brief stint at Wolves before he again took over at Watford, leading them to two promotions in as many years as he guided them back into English football's top flight. He also returned to manage Villa in 2002 but retired a year later. His association with Watford continued when he became chairman in 2009, a post he held for three years, and the clubrenamed their Rous Stand at Vicarage Road after Taylor in 2014. ""In this day and age, when a stand is named after somebody, it's for commercial reasons. I felt honoured,"" he told BBC Three Counties Radio at the time.

Taylor will be remembered, by those who had dealings with him in his career as a manager and a BBC Sport pundit, as one of the nicest and most genuine men you could ever meet. He, in many respects, was vastly underrated as a manager because of his unfulfilling spell with England, but close scrutiny of his record proved his pedigree. Taylor took Watford from the Fourth Division to second place in the First Division, as well as the 1984 FA Cup final, before the advent of the Premier League. It was a remarkable feat. He continued at Aston Villa, not only taking them back into the top flight but almost winning the title, finishing second to Liverpool in his third season at the club. A spell at Wolves did not work out but he reproduced the old magic in a second spell at Watford, taking them into the Premier League, although a second stint at Villa was not so successful. Above all, this is a loss that will be felt keenly throughout football's generations because the game has lost one its true gentlemen.

Ross Hawkins: Copeland by-election goes nuclear,"A by-election will be held in Copeland later this year Ross Hawkins visits Copeland in Cumbria where theoutgoing Labour MPis yet to leave his job but campaigning to elect his replacement has already begun in earnest. Conservatives are putting Jeremy Corbyn at the centre of their Copeland by-election campaign. His image is all over Tory leaflets, and their logic is very simple. Copeland relies on the nuclear industry and Jeremy Corbyn has opposed new nuclear power stations. It means that when a by-election date is set, the contest in Cumbria could reveal a lot about how national politics will play out in the coming months. Tories will highlight an issue that divides Mr Corbyn and his colleagues. But amid a huge local row about hospitals, Labour may discover how much damage troubles in the NHS have done to the Conservatives. Labour's campaign focuses on a row about local hospitals Chat to voters in the constituency and you hear two concerns: jobs and healthcare. In the butcher's in Whitehaven, one customer, Geoffrey Boyle, says: ""This spot's dead enough already. There's hardly any life around here now. If nuclear goes, this town will be dead."" The economy revolves around Sellafield, and job numbers are set to fall there as reprocessing work ends. A new nuclear power station is proposed. Labour backs new nuclear energy, and local politicians certainly do. But Mr Corbyn has made plain in the past that he disagrees. Apolicy document,externalfor his leadership campaign in 2015 says plainly: ""I am opposed to fracking and to new nuclear on the basis of the dangers posed to our ecosystems."" In a 2011 speech,externalin the wake of the Fukushima disaster he went further, suggesting existing nuclear power stations should be decommissioned. Sources close to Mr Corbyn say he no longer believes that's practical but Tories campaigning in Copeland have seized on his words. The Convervatives hope to exploit Labour divisions over nuclear power Councillor, local Labour party secretary and would-be candidate Gillian Troughton says: ""Jeremy Corbyn is not the entire Labour party and Labour policy is for the green, low-carbon energy policy of which nuclear power is a key part."" UKIP, which came third here at the last election, boasts that it can take Labour votes. Fiona Mills - who has been UKIP's candidate in Carlisle - is hoping to contest Copeland. She says: ""When I stood in the general election I definitely took voters away from Labour because people told me that."" But while people here are worried about nuclear jobs, many are furious about healthcare. There is a proposal to move services, including a consultant-led maternity unit, from the hospital in Whitehaven 40 miles down a slow, twisting road to Carlisle. Michelle, who works in the butcher's, says: ""Why don't we stick a fellow in the back of an ambulance who's making these decisions and stick a monitor on him that creates the pain the same as labour and see how he feels about that?"" Labour's message is that only it will care for the local NHS. Conservative councillor Kevin Beaty says what happens to the hospital is a decision for the local NHS and blames ""a PFI in the north set up under the last Labour government that is really difficult from a financial point of view for them"". But with a decision about the hospital due in March, potentially before a by-election date, it's a clear and present danger to Tory hopes. What happens to the hospital is a decision for the local NHS, says Tory councillor Kevin Beaty If the Conservatives win, it will be the first time since 1982 the governing party has gained a seat in a by-election. Should that happen, Jamie Reed - the departing Labour MP - will in prompting the contest have done deeper damage to Mr Corbyn than he ever managed in many months criticising his leader. If Labour fails here blame will be piled deep at the door of the party leader. Yet speculation about an electoral upset has raised Tory expectations in a patch that has been Labour since 1935. Merely holding on to a seat that even Margaret Thatcher couldn't seize could yet wind up feeling like a win for Labour. If it's successful, a Labour strategy of responding to relentless attacks on Mr Corbyn with an equally relentless focus on the NHS may provide a model for the opposition in the years ahead. 2015 Copeland General Election result Labour MP Jamie Reed quitting Parliament NHS chief contradicts May over spending Fukushima report: Key points Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

What to do if you have a cold or flu,"None of us can dodge colds and flu, and there are a wide range of potential treatments that we all turn to. But not all of them will help - and which remedy you should turn to will depend on whether you have a cold or the flu. They share similar symptoms - but they are different beasts. A cold will make you feel rotten. Flu is more severe and sends you to your bed. It's also likely to come with a fever and leave you feeling truly exhausted. So here is what the evidence has shown helps... and what doesn't. Most of us will have heard this old adage. But experts at the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff say there isn't good evidence behind it. The saying may have come about because people with a fever often lose their appetite. The advice is that you should try to eat some healthy food to keep your strength up, but don't feel that you have to force it down if you're not hungry. Listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard and get some rest. How much you need will depend on how you feel. Certainly, a mild cold shouldn't stop you getting out and about... or going to work! Neither is proven to help, but honey and lemon might be a better option than the whisky, particularly if you plan to have more than one drink. Doctors recommend plenty of fluids - by which they mean water - plus the odd cup of tea or coffee. If you have a cold or the flu you will probably be sneezing, coughing and sweating out more fluid than you normally would, and so need to keep topped up. But don't overdo it. There is plenty of research to show that drinking too much water can be dangerous - and can even kill. Both work. You can even take paracetamol and ibuprofen together to ease your symptoms - it is safe to take both doses at the same time or spaced apart. But do keep tabs on how much you've had so you don't exceed the maximum recommended doses in any 24-hour period. Ibuprofen is best taken with food or on a full stomach. There's no good evidence that they work, but they could offer some temporary relief. Rubbing some on your chest or putting a few drops in a steamy bowl of water can help unblock your nose. Vitamin C has been proposed as a treatment for respiratory infections since the 1930s. It became particularly popular in the 1970s when a Nobel laureate - Linus Pauling - suggested that studies comparing it with a placebo (dummy) treatment showed vitamin C would prevent and alleviate colds. But a recent analysis by theCochrane Group,external, which assesses medical evidence for and against different treatments and therapies, found dosing up doesn't appear to help that much, if at all. Vitamin C is pretty harmless - we pee out any excess amounts that the body can't use. But Zinc can be dangerous if you take too much, so the advice is to take care with the quantity you take. There has been a huge public information campaign to raise awareness of when antibiotics are - and are not - necessary. Antibiotics are no use in treating colds and flu because they are caused by viruses - and antibiotics do not treat viruses. The only time you need to see your GP is if a bacterial infection develops. NHS Choices hasmore information,externalon cold and flu care. We'd like to hear about your tried and trusted remedies -join the debate,externalon Facebook.

Cafe siege,"Islamist militants would have killed Shishir Sarker if they'd known he was a Hindu When five armed Islamist militants stormed a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 1 July 2016, 29 people lost their lives. Emerging from the appalling, bloody debris are stories of immense courage. There are also unanswered questions about what happened to some of those who died. It was about 20:45 on a Friday evening just before the Islamic festival of Eid. The restaurant - the Holey Artisan Bakery and O'Kitchen in Gulshan, Dhaka's leafiest, most exclusive area - was filling up, mostly with Japanese and Italian customers. Suddenly, the five young militants burst in shooting and began hacking at the diners with sharp weapons. Shishir Sarker, one of the Holey Artisan's chefs, was coming out of the refrigerated chiller room with a plate of pasta when he heard shouting. ""Then I saw one of the attackers - in one hand he had a sword or machete, and a gun was slung across his chest,"" Sarker recalls. As a Hindu, he had good reason to be afraid - if the Islamist militants found out his religion, it would be a death sentence. ""At that moment, a Japanese man shouted to me: 'Help me!',"" he says. ""I turned and went back inside the chiller, and helped him in too."" Police walk past the Holey Artisan Bakery There was no latch to lock the chiller from the inside, so the two men pulled on the door to keep it shut. ""The Japanese guy asked me who those men were. I said I didn't know, but don't worry, the police are coming."" For nearly two hours the men stayed quietly inside. ""It was really cold. We did some exercise to try and keep warm - sit-ups holding the door pulled shut,"" Sarker says.

""We held on to it very hard and he failed. He went away, but now they knew someone was inside."" And 10 or 15 minutes later the militant came back. ""We were so cold, we were losing our strength,"" Sarker says. The attacker hauled the door open. A woman shows a mobile phone picture of her brother-in-law, a restaurant employee ""He told me to come out. I was so frightened I immediately fell on to the ground and lay there. I thought if I was standing, he might chop me with his machete. I was repeatedly saying: 'For Allah's sake, don't kill me.'"" Assuming he was Muslim, and therefore not a target, the gunman told him to go and join his colleagues on the other side of the restaurant. ""I crawled on my hands and knees over dead bodies and blood. Then suddenly I heard two shots. The Japanese man with me in the chiller was dead."" Sarker sat at a table with other members of staff, all of them with their heads down. After 02:00, one of the militants asked who the chef was. His colleagues pointed at Sarker. He was taken to the kitchen. ""They asked me what food we had - if we had sea bass and shrimps. I said, yes we had. They told me to fry it, and decorate it nicely on a plate."" While Sarker was cooking, one of the militants came into the kitchen. ""He asked me what my name was.  I just said my name was Shishir - I didn't tell him my second name because that would have revealed that I'm Hindu."" Perhaps the militant was suspicious. He asked Sarker to recite from the Koran. Sarker calmly carried on frying sea bass. And he recited Koranic verses. ""All my life I've had Muslim friends, so I knew some Surah [chapters of the Koran]. But I was so frightened. I was thinking - would I satisfy him?"" In keeping with Islamic tradition during Ramadan, the food was served before dawn to the Muslim hostages and to the staff. ""I was so scared, when I ate I couldn't swallow the food. But I thought if I didn't eat, they would think I wasn't going to fast the following day, and then they would guess I wasn't Muslim,"" says Sarker. Soon after sunrise, Operation Thunderbolt - a commando-led assault with armoured personnel carriers - ended the siege. The five militants lay dead. Sarker and his surviving colleagues were rescued. Life will never be the same for this unassuming young chef.  He is working again, but still traumatised by that hellish night. ""I don't see any future.  I can't sleep properly.  Whenever I'm alone and I think of that night, I just can't do anything - I feel terrified."" Faraaz Ayaaz Hossain, a 20-year-old studying at a university in the US, was home in Dhaka for the holidays. He had arranged to meet two old school friends at the Holey Artisan that night - Abinta Kabir, a US citizen from a Bangladeshi family studying at the same university, and Tarishi Jain, who was Indian, a Hindu and a student in California. Hossain and the young women had just taken their seats in the restaurant when the attack began. A family driver called his mother and told her something was amiss. ""As soon as my mum heard, she barged into my room and said, 'I'm going',"" says Faraaz's brother Zaraif. ""She put on her shawl, took her phone, and ran - I ran behind her. ""When we got there people started telling us they'd heard the assailants shouting: 'Allahu Akbar!' That's when it hit us this must be more serious than an armed robbery or something."" After 21:30, some 45 minutes after the attack had begun, a number of the restaurant staff managed to escape via the roof. They appeared on the street, and Zaraif and his mother homed in on one of the waiters. ""We asked, 'Have you seen a boy with two girls?' We were showing a picture of Faraaz on our phones. And he said, 'I've seen them, they're hiding under a table.'"" But other details were chilling. The waiter said everyone who was foreign was being kept in one section. And everyone who was considered Bangladeshi and Muslim was put into another section. ""At that moment my mother turned to me and said: 'Tarishi and Abinta won't be let go. I'm so scared, because I know my son - I know Faraaz, and he's not going to leave his friends.'"" Hossain (left) was a keen Manchester United supporter When the siege ended, Faraaz and both his friends were dead - murdered by the militants. And an incredible account emerged of Faraaz's last moments, validating his mother's fears. ""So what we heard about what transpired was that, wellâ¦ Faraaz was a Bangladeshi and a Muslim and therefore, logically, he would have been let go by the terrorists,"" says his brother. ""But when he was told to leave, Faraaz said: 'What about my friends?' And when they were denied freedom, he said: 'I'm not leaving them.'"" The story of Faraaz's selfless act has brought international recognition, including the Mother Theresa Memorial International Award for Social Justice, which was conferred posthumously on this bright young man. In Bangladesh too, he has been celebrated. ""In remote places, people are having discussion meetings saying: 'Faraaz is Bangladesh, this is who we are - not the terrorists,'"" says Faraaz's grandfather, the industrialist, Latifur Rahman. ""In Banshkhali, they named a square after him. The other day a professor at one of our universities gave birth to a boy and named him Faraaz - because, she said, she wanted him to have the same values as Faraaz."" This is heartening for the family. But it cannot replace the mad-keen Manchester United fan - a young man destined, says his grandfather, for leadership and success. ""I struggle with it every day. I understand what he did, I deeply admire what he did, but I struggle with understanding how one could do that.  I struggle because I don't have the guts.  I don't have the strength to do what this young boy did.  I wish he was here with me."" Zakir Hossain Shaon's family home on the southern outskirts of Dhaka feels like a million miles from the upmarket restaurant where he was employed. Down a track that skirts a pond covered in water hyacinth, his parents, brothers and sister live in a tiny one-room house with an adjoining kitchen. Shaon, 18, had worked at the Holey Artisan for about a year. ""He adapted quickly to that job and his cooking duties,"" says his father, Abdus Sattar. ""All his colleagues loved him because he was the youngest,"" says Zakir's mother, Maksuda Begum. On the evening of 1 July, Shaon was at work. He called his mother and told her he had been paid an Eid bonus, and would be coming home the next day, or the day after. It was many hours before his parents found out about the attack - as it was the month of Ramadan, they were not watching television that evening. In the morning, they were told about it by neighbours, and headed to Gulshan with Shaon's picture. They went from one police officer to another showing their son's photo. They talked to countless people on the streets. No-one knew anything. At 22:00 that night, Sattar was in Gulshan police station. He says an officer there told him his son was alive, but that he could not say where he was. Meanwhile, on local TV, pictures of Shaon were shown. They were taken sometime before 03:00 on 2 July, while the militants were still inside the Holey Artisan. In them, Shaon is sitting in the back of a police vehicle, officers holding his arms. He is bleeding from the chest, but he is clearly conscious. Somehow he had escaped the siege. So where was he now? On the morning of 3 July, Shaon's parents got a call from a surviving member of the Holey Artisan's staff. He told them their son was in Dhaka Medical College Hospital. They rushed to see him. It was deeply distressing. He looked as though he had been beaten. There were marks on his legs, and he had a black eye which was not there on the TV pictures. He slipped in and out of consciousness. ""Every time he came to his senses he said one thing - 'Don't hit me please, don't beat me any more. Let me go,'"" remembers his mother. ""The police grabbed him, and they tortured him. They hit him on the head. They kicked him. They indiscriminately beat him,"" she claims. The chief of counter-terrorism for Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Monirul Islam, says Shaon was not in police custody. ""He was injured while he was trying to escape [from the restaurant].  He was taken to the hospital after Holey Bakery incident, at midnight I think. We are not sure who took whom to the hospital."" Dhaka Medical College Hospital can find no record of admitting Shaon, so the date and time he arrived cannot be confirmed. His father tried to make a complaint to the police. ""They didn't pay any heed to it,"" he says. Shaon died on 8 July - a week after the siege. His family are still looking for answers. On 11 January, the Holey Artisan Bakery reopened, albeit in a different location. The previous Friday, Dhaka police said one of the alleged masterminds of the siege had been shot dead. The shockwaves from the attack continue to reverberate across Bangladesh. Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Plans for new Chelsea stadium approved,"This video can not be played Chelsea stadium Chelsea Football Club have been given permission by the local council to build a new Â£500m 60,000-seat stadium. Hammersmith and Fulham council's planning committee have backed plans to demolish the current 41,600-capacity Stamford Bridge stadium. The plans include a walkway from the nearby District Line station. ""We are grateful that planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of our historic home,"" Chelseasaid in a statement.,external ""The committee decision does not mean that work can begin on site. This is just the latest step, although a significant one, that we have to take before we can commence work, including obtaining various other permissions."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan will have the final say on whether Chelsea can build their new stadium. The new stadium has been designed by architects Herzog and de Meuron, who were also responsible for the ""Birds Nest"" Olympic stadium in Beijing. The proposals could mean owner Roman Abramovich has to find a temporary home for the current Premier League leaders for up to three years, with both Twickenham Stadium and Wembley Stadium being looked at as possible options. An artist's impression of the proposed new Stamford Bridge stadium Chelsea might, however, struggle to use Wembley as north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will occupy the national stadium for at least the 2017-18 football season as work finishes on Spurs' own new 61,000-capacity stadium. Chelsea could stay at Stamford Bridge while the work takes place but this is thought to be the most expensive option. The plans showing the outline of the new Chelsea stadium at Stamford Bridge including a new walkway to the ground from Fulham Broadway Tube station Mr Abramovich has wanted to increase capacity at Chelsea on match days for a number of years. He previously attempted to buy Battersea Power Station with a view to redeveloping the site into a new stadium, ultimately losing out to property developers who are currently building luxury apartments at the site. Ten years ago Arsenal built the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium, last summer West Ham moved to the 57,000-capacity Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, and Spurs are currently redeveloping their White Hart Lane ground. The current 41,663-capacity Stamford Bridge is the seventh biggest stadium used by a Premier League team, well behind Manchester United's 76,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford.

My nightmare,"Millions of women rely on the contraceptive pill and many are happy with it - but some find it has a devastating effect on their mental health. Here Vicky Spratt, deputy editor of The Debrief, describes years of depression, anxiety and panic as she tried one version of the pill after another. I sat in the GP's office with my mum and told her that I'd been having my period for three weeks. She told me that the contraceptive pill might help. She warned that it wouldn't protect me from sexually transmitted infections and told me that if I had unprotected sex I could get cervical cancer, so I'd best use it wisely. She had to say that, though I was 14 and sex was very much not on the agenda. My prescription was printed in reception. And then, a three-month supply of the combined pill was mine. Picking up the green foil-covered packets full of tiny yellow pills felt like a rite of passage - I was a woman now. In the plastic pockets was the sugar-coated distillation of feminism, of women's liberation, of medical innovation. This is where it all began, 14 years ago. I then played what I call pill roulette for more than a decade, trying different brands with varying degrees of success and disaster. It was around this time that I also developed anxiety, depression and serious mood swings which, on and off, have affected me throughout my adult life. Relationships have ended and I had to take a year out from university - I thought that was just ""who I was"", a person ill-equipped for life, lacking self-confidence and unhappy. It wouldn't be until my early 20s, after graduating from university - when my mental health problems and behaviour could no longer be dismissed as those of a ""moody teenager"" - that I would seriously question whether it was linked to my use of the pill. Pill varieties There are two main kinds of pill: the combined pill - which combines oestrogen and progestogen (a synthetic form of progesterone) - and the progestogen-only pill (POP) or mini-pill There are many brands of the combined pill - the dose may differ, and the relative amounts of oestrogen and progestogen There are also different types of the progestogen-only pill, making use of different progestogens, such as norethistorone or desogestrel Women who have problems with one pill may find another has no side effects One day in the early hours, sitting at my laptop, unable to sleep because of a panic attack which had lasted overnight, I began to Google. I had started taking a new pill, a progestogen-only pill (POP) which had been prescribed because I was suffering from migraines, and the combined pill is not safe for people who suffer from migraines with aura. I tapped the name of the pill + depression/anxiety into the search engine and the internet did the rest. There it was: forum threads and blog posts from people who were experiencing the same symptoms as me. At this point I had already seen my GP several times, following the sudden onset of debilitating panic attacks, which I had never experienced before. At no point had my contraceptive pill come up in conversation, despite the fact that the attacks had started when I switched to the new contraceptive. Instead, I was prescribed a high dose of beta blockers, used to treat anxiety, and it was recommended that I should undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). I lived like this for somewhere between six and eight months - I can't tell you exactly because that year of my life is a blur, recorded by my mind in fast-forward because of the constant sense of urgency and impending doom that coursed through my veins. This video can not be played Listen to Vicky Spratt on Woman's Hour Find out more The Debrief carried out an investigation, surveying 1,022 readers, aged 18-30 93% had taken or were taking the pill Of these, 45% had experienced anxiety and 45% had experienced depression 46% said taking the pill had decreased their sex drive 58% believed that the pill had a negative impact on their mental health - 4% believed it had a positive effect The Debrief's investigation in full,external I wish, wholeheartedly, that I could look back on this and laugh. That's how all good stories end, isn't it? But there was then, and is now, nothing funny about what I went through. It was terrifying. I was scared. I didn't recognise myself, I didn't like myself and I couldn't live my life. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or whether it would ever end. I was not only anxious but lethargic, I felt completely useless. I blamed myself. At the time, convinced that I had lost my mind and feeling as though I was having an out-of-body experience, I explained to my GP that ""I felt like someone else"", as though my brain ""had gone off and gone mouldy"". ""Do you think this could have anything to do with my new pill?"" I asked. I remember the look on her face, an attempt to look blank which barely concealed a desire to tell me I was ridiculous. I explained to her that I had felt awful on every single one of the six or seven pills I'd taken up until that point, with the exception of one high-oestrogen combined pill which made me feel like superwoman for a year, before it was taken away from me (partly because of the migraines and partly because of an increased risk of thrombosis with continued use). She told me, categorically, that my new pill was not the problem. But, disobeying both her and my therapist, I stopped taking the progestogen-only pill. I can only describe what happened next as the gradual and creeping return of my sense of self. After three or four weeks I also stopped taking the beta blockers. To this day, I still carry them with me. They're in every handbag I own, a safety net should I fall off the enormous cliff of my own mind again. In three-and-a-half years I have never had to take them. My problems didn't disappear overnight, of course, but I did stop having panic attacks. I haven't had one since. I feel low from time to time, anxious and stressed but it's nowhere near on the same scale as what I experienced while taking the progestogen-only pill. I felt joy again, my libido returned and I stopped feeling terrified of absolutely everything and everyone. A year after the panic attacks subsided I sat on a faraway beach, after taking a solo long-haul flight halfway round the world. This would have been unthinkable the previous year. As I sat there, underneath a tropical electrical storm, I cried with relief. Relief that I was myself again, relief that I had control of my own mind once more and relief that I hadn't been wrong, that I knew myself better than doctors had made me feel I did. Now 28, I no longer use hormonal contraception and with the exception of mild mood swings in the 48 hours before my period I am, touch wood, free of anxiety, depression and panic attacks. In the years that have passed since I lost myself on the progestogen-only pill and found myself again on a South Asian beach, this issue has been gradually receiving more and more attention. Holly Grigg Spall's book, Sweetening The Pill, published in 2013, put the effects of hormonal contraception on women's mental health firmly on the agenda. Since then a study, overseen by Prof Ojvind Lidegaard at the University of Copenhagen, found that women taking the pill - either the combined pill or the progestogen-only pill - were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than those not on hormonal contraception. The difference was particularly noticeable for young women aged between 15 and 19 on the combined pill. Lidegaard was able to conduct this research because he had access to medical records for more than a million Danish women aged 15-34. Following the publication of Prof Lidegaard's study I sent a freedom of information request to the NHS, in my capacity as a journalist at The Debrief. I knew, from the number of our readers who write to us on a near-daily basis about this issue, that significant numbers of women were suffering. I asked the NHS whether they knew how many women were taking antidepressants or beta blockers concurrently. They told me that their systems do not yet allow them to collect this data. The pill and depression Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, says: ""There is an established link between hormones and mood, both positive and negative, but for the vast majority of women, the benefits of reliable contraception and regulation of their menstrual cycle outweigh any side effects, and many women report that taking hormones actually boosts their mood. ""If a woman believes her contraception might be adversely affecting her mood, she should discuss it with a healthcare professional at her next routine appointment."" See also:How risky is the contraceptive pill? Depression is listed as a known but rare side effect of the hormonal contraceptive pill, it's there in the small but hefty leaflet you get in the packet. TheNHS website lists ""mood swings"" and ""mood changes"",externalbut not explicitly depression, anxiety or panic attacks. We shouldn't throw our pill packets away but neither should we accept negative side effects which impinge on our day-to-day lives. We can't make informed choices without information. We need better research into how hormonal contraception can affect women's mental health, better ways of monitoring reactions in patients, more awareness and support for those who do experience serious side effects. No woman should feel dismissed or ignored. Vicky Spratt is deputy editor of The Debrief, a website for women in their 20s. Its investigation, Mad About The Pill, launched on Wednesday.

Sportsday - rolling news and gossip,"Ex-England manager Graham Taylor, 72, dies Taylor also managed Watford and Villa, among others Your memories of Taylor: #bbcsportsday Andy Donley and Shamoon Hafez It's been an emotional day for football, and that's been evident in the massive outpouring of affection for Graham Taylor, both within the sport and from you at home. You can read Phil McNulty's obituary to Taylorhere, or find a round-up of the day's eventshere. Thanks for joining us. Graham Taylor, RIP. Match of the Day Facebook Steve Aylward:R.I.P. Always remember you bringing Villa to Gresty Rd in the FA Cup and being 2-0 down at half-time and saying ""you got yourselves into this mess, now get yourself out of it"" - unfortunately for Crewe you did 2 - 3 R.I.P one of the nice guys of English football. John Swaby:Â I'm completely devastated. Best Lincoln manager ever. Nicest bloke you could wish to meet. Even when he was England manager he regularly came to events at Lincoln.Â Â Jeffery Hewerdine:Â I was at the match in 1972 when he took Lincoln into another league... we stormed the pitch and clapped him a standing ovation. Happy Days! Â Thank you to everybody who has shared their stories of Graham Taylor throughout the day. Graham Taylor tributes The tribute to Graham Taylor is rounding off on 5 live now, with current Burnley manager Sean Dyche paying tribute to a man who he came into contact with during his first job in management at Watford. ""He had an extremely thick skin, and he showed that by defending me on radio when I was a young manager as well. Things like that mean a lot,"" he said.Â ""To have that strength behind me when I was a young manager meant a lot. ""I'm forever in his debt for the help that he gave me.""

In a later tweet, Gary added: ""He made me his England captain and I will be eternally grateful to him for giving me that honour."" Graham Taylor tributes Daily Mirror Former Mirror journalist Harry Harris:""Graham got a really hard time by the media, but it was a media with teeth. That is now a pro-FA an anti-Fifa. There was a circulation war with The Sun but that existed before and after him. ""He suffered a vindictive personal attack but people are eulogising him today as a great person and manager. He did not cut it as an England manager though, he was out of his depth. Not since Taylor has an England manager has suffered the vitriol he did. On Swedes 2-1 Turnips headline:""It was quite funny but it is not funny if you are on the receiving end of it. He was brought up in media, he bend over backwards to help us but he did not have to deal with the forensic examinations that they have to deal with today. ""He was a bitter man towards journalists after that. What happened with England broke his heart and it never left him. He was very bitter about it but he was the right man at the time. It was very unfortunate what happened with refereeing decisions but he was a genuine football guy who did not deserve what he got from the media at the time."" Graham Taylor tributes ""Do I not like that..."" They're discussing the infamous Graham Taylor documentary on 5 live at the moment, in which he allowed himself and the England team to be filmed in the the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup. Our very own Tom Rostance took a look back on how it was allowed to happen - and just how funny it is in retrospect -here. Graham Taylor tributes John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator I met him first in the 1970s at Lincoln and then he went on to revolutionise Watford. Elton John had inteviewed Bobby Moore, who did not get the job and Graham did. He turned them into a family club and made sure players went to all the local functions. He led them to the FA Cup final, but he took them to Europe too. He pitted his wits against the best. I once fell out with Graham after asking him if he wanted to play more sophisticated football. He almost spat it back in my face. He had a fantastic career as a club manager and it is a tribute to him that BBC Radio 5 live, who he loved working for, are explaining what an influence he had on football. BBC Match of the Day Facebook Will Room:I remember seeing a clip of Taylor in the dugout during a match, and some fans behind him shouting out racial abuse to a player on the pitch and he went hell for leather against them - didn't hold back telling the fans to sit down and shut up basically. Back then it was probably normal for fans to think they could get away with stuff like that but Graham Taylor was definitely a decent man and respected everyone who played for him. Top bloke.Â Share your memories of Taylor via Twitter at #bbcsportsday and through the BBC Match of the Day Facebook page. Graham Taylor tributes John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator I was with him on 1 January, he had lunch with us in the boardroom and was in fantastic form.Â We were chatting and he reminded me of a story when my son was born in 1986. I had been at Watford the night before, in those days we did not all attend the births of our children, but I got a call from someone at the hospital saying I have had a son.Â I spoke to my wife later and told her I had already been given a call - it was Graham Taylor and that was the family man he was. Â Graham Taylor tributes John Murray5 live football correspondent He was such good company - a football man. When you spent time with him you realised he had so many other interests. He was steeped in football. He loved the game and everything about it. He was brilliant at being interested in other people and would always want to talk about football.Â Graham Taylor tributes John Murray5 live football correspondent It's going on 20 years now that he was working as a match summariser, and he was very loyal to the BBC.Â What was her like to work with as a commentator? I think if I'm going into a poor match and nothing is happening, is my summariser going to help me out? With Graham that was never a problem.

Graham Taylor tributes BBC Radio 5 live Former Aston Villa winger Tony Daley:""We had just been relegated and things were not going great. Graham came in and said he was going to get us promoted. He asked if you wanted to be part of it and you gave him respect straight away. ""I was 18 and people were raving about me, he said if I don't buck my ideas up I would be down the road. He was the biggest influence of my career and like a father-figure to me. He brought my game on so much. ""What I liked about him, when things were going great he would put you down a peg, when things were not going great, he put an arm around you and made you feel invincible. ""He was a big believer in tactics and the advantages of set-pieces. He got his teams well organised and was into his stats. He was ahead of his time."" #bbcsportsday Dave Revell:ÂMet Graham Taylor at a charity day for Kit Aid. Had so much time for people and was always so nice. One of England's better managers. Glenn J Dann:ÂG.T. wasn't a bad England manager - just lack of quality at his disposal. He may have fared better with today's talent. Tom McCarron:ÂEpitomises true gent Graham Taylor.

We've just heard about Taylor's relationship with Watford goal machine Luther Blissett on 5 live, and here is what the big man himself had to say about his former gaffer earlier. Graham Taylor tributes BBC Radio 5 live Forward Watford striker Luther Blissett:""It was a shock to hear Graham's passing, I can't believe it has happened. ""To be able to talk about somebody, it comes fairly easy when it is for someone like Graham. He used to do some of his team-talks in the freezing cold on a Friday. Everybody would go 'yeh, yeh' and it would go on for 20 minutes. He paid attention to details and that is why he had so much success. ""Whoever he brought to Watford, he wanted to know about the person. Were they married? He was a big family man, people and community was a big in his upbringing, that was the same as a manager. He could tell the mood players were in and them manage them. ""When AC Milan came in, we spoke about it. Even at 1am, he came and took em to one side and said, 'the club are happy with everything, but if you are not, we will tear up everything and go back to training'. Players were the most important thing about the football club.""

What makes Marine Le Pen far right?12 January 2017 (00:25:57),"Marine Le Pen has been increasingly looking to the centre and left for votes She described Britain's vote for Brexit as the most important event since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Donald Trump's US presidential victory as ""an additional stone in the building of a new world"". Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front (FN), is fighting to achieve a similar earthquake in France in the presidential elections in 2017. But with her increasing appeal to the centre and the left of French politics, how much can she really be characterised as far-right? Marine Le Pen is the youngest daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the FN and a convicted racist, who last year repeated an old anti-Semitic slur that the Nazi gas chambers were ""a detail of history"". Having grown up in a political home, accompanying him to meetings from the age of 13, Marine Le Pen was always going to struggle to shake off the far-right label. But she did denounce her father's comments in 2015, and effectively expelled him from the party. While her father was leader, the FN was the party that wanted to deport three million foreigners, the party of Holocaust denial and xenophobia. But under Marine Le Pen the FN began to distance itself from such controversial issues. ""Damned by her father"" - Marine Le Pen managed to get her far-right father off the political stage after his remarks about the Holocaust Such efforts at detoxification have proved successful, with polls suggesting support for the FN climbing from 18% in 2010 to about 24% today. Nonetheless, when voters are questioned they still place the FN and Ms Le Pen ""way more to the right than other parties"", says Nonna Mayer, expert in racism and the FN at Sciences Po university. Where does she go from here in her pursuit of a detoxified party? The FN has traditionally been a male, blue-collar-dominated party, and the leader needs to target women, says Dr Mayer. So Ms Le Pen has softened her approach to women's rights, and even sees herself as a quasi-feminist. In fact, Dr Mayer argues, in many respects Ms Le Pen is more socially liberal than much of the mainstream right - something that has caused divisions within her own party. National Front: Far right or hard left? Le Pen rails against globalisation The 2017 National Front manifesto renews its commitment to a massive reduction in legal immigration. Ms Le Pen argues French citizenship should be ""either inherited or merited"". As for illegal immigrants, they ""have no reason to stay in France, these people broke the law the minute they set foot on French soil"". But if that is a far-right stance, it is not very different from that of centre-right candidate Francois Fillon - who when first elected as the Republican candidate enjoyed a small advantage over Ms Le Pen in polls but has since been damaged by claims of improper use of state funds. ""We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum,"" he says. In a world where the centre is shifting to the right, and the right is shifting to the centre, the lines are getting blurred. What now for France's left and far right? Le Pen stalks French centre-right contest Guide to nationalist parties in Europe The two are now competing for some of the same voters. While Mr Fillon is regarded as appealing more to the ""respectable"" middle classes, Marine Le Pen is claiming to speak for ""all people"", and increasingly appealing to a wider electorate, even Muslim voters in the French suburbs. Marine Le Pen increasingly claims to speak ""in the name of the people"" However, in December she upped the ante by announcing that she would end free education for the children of undocumented immigrants, though this did not appear as a pledge in the party's manifesto. ""If you come to our country, don't expect to be taken care of, to be looked after, that your children will be educated without charge,"" she said in a speech in Paris. And, more threateningly, ""playtime is over"". Long before the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015, Marine Le Pen made a link between immigration and militant Islamism. In the immediate aftermath, she proposed to ""expel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil"" and to strip dual-nationality Muslims with extremist views of their French citizenship, a view traditionally associated with the far right. In an unprecedented move, those ideas were endorsed both by Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls and by President Francois Hollande, before eventually being dropped. Many of her views have been echoed by Francois Fillon too. Mr Fillon, a devout Catholic, described radical Islam as a ""totalitarianism like the Nazis"". Catholics, Protestants and Jews ""don't denounce the values of the Republic,"" he said, indicating that was not the case with Islam. ""The clear blue water between the FN and the other parties has been disappearing and disappearing,"" says James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University. The National Front is to the right of the Republicans on law and order issues, says Nonna Mayer. Its 2017 election manifesto includes upping police numbers and powers and creating 40,000 new prison places. There is no mention in this manifesto of the FN's previous pledge to restore the death penalty, an issue that divides the party's core supporters from the mainstream. Polls suggest 60% of FN voters are in favour, compared with 28% of mainstream-right and 11% of left-wing voters. Treatment of immigrants in France is probably the standout, far-right policy of Marine Le Pen's FN. And it is central to the party's platform. Jobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to French nationals before they get to ""foreigners"". The centre of gravity of French politics may have shifted to the right. But no other party has adopted favouritism across the social services - and it could breach the law. Marine Le Pen's niece tweets this: ""Fillon is for the national birth right, for family reunion, against restoration of the borders, against national priority"" ""She is upholding a policy that not only is thought by constitutional experts to be unconstitutional, but has been judged by the law to be unlawful,"" says Prof Shields. In 1998, a National Front mayor, Catherine Megret, tried to implement a new policy that would give a family allowance to French or EU families, but not to other foreign families. ""Did it stand up in court? No,"" says Prof Shields. But, he says, so-called nativism remains central in Ms Le Pen's platform. Marine Le Pen appeals to French voters fed up with mainstream politics, but there is nothing far right about that. If she wins the presidency in May, she has promised an EU referendum in France within six months of taking office. And the UK's vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has provided the template. Portraying herself as beyond the establishment, she has championed public services - for non-foreigners - and presented herself as a protector of workers and farmers in the face of ""wild and anarchic globalisation"". This video can not be played Marine Le Pen: 'Trump made the impossible possible' ""She's managing to get these approval ratings by doing a Trump,"" says Prof Shields. But here the lines are blurred too: left-wing parties are playing the anti-establishment, anti-globalisation card as well. But what sets her European views apart from the rest of the French right is the company she keeps. The FN has strong ties with the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), Austria's Freedom Party (FPOe), Belgium's Flemish Interest (VB), Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Italian Northern League (LN). They are all part of the FN-led Europe of Nations and Freedom grouping in the European Parliament and are either right-wing populist or, in the case of the FPOe, far right. Marine Le Pen associates herself with other right-wing leaders in Europe, for example Geert Wilders of the Dutch PVV Geert Wilders, of leader of the Dutch PVV, wants to ban the Koran. The Italian Northern League's leader Matteo Salvini is known for his praise of fascist leader Benito Mussolini. These views are toxic to the political right in Europe, and many centre-right parties have said they will not form coalitions with them.
