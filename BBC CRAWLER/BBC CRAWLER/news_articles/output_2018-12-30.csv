The life of the undisputed queen of the circus,"Depictions of the Bougliones' marriage inside a lion's cage were sold as postcards in France, and graced magazine covers When Rosa Bouglione was married inside a lion's cage, the pastor, despite his best efforts, was made to stay outside. It wouldn't have been much of a wedding had he been mauled. It was only appropriate that this was where Rosa had chosen to be married. After all, she had started her career inside a lion's cage, working as a serpentine dancer, in her mid-teens. This was the circus life into which she was born, in the back of a horse-drawn caravan in Belgium in December 1910. Her father was an animal trainer with the family outfit, MÃ©nagerie Van Been, and they toured Europe alongside their snakes, bears and lions. ""I was born in a caravan, and that's where I left my heart,"" Rosa would later write in her autobiography. Aged 17, however, there was another contender for her heart: she fell for a man from another circus family, Joseph Bouglione, who she said reminded her of a cowboy, and the two were married among the lions. Their honeymoon was as unusual as their wedding - they spent it working with the troupe of the Wild West Show, established by hunter and showman Buffalo Bill Cody. Rosa's life after joining the Bouglione family brought her close to France's high society and made her a household name, even if attitudes towards the circus began to change in her later years. ""He was always so well-dressed,"" Rosa said of Joseph Bouglione. ""With his big hat and boots, he had the look of a cowboy."" Rosa Bouglione died in Paris on Sunday, 26 August aged 107. Her funeral on Wednesday took place in the ring of the Cirque d'Hiver (Winter Circus), the 1,500-person venue in the Marais district which she and her husband's family took over in 1934. The grand circular building, commissioned by Napoleon III, remained the Bouglione family's base, even as they, their animals, clowns and performers travelled the world. It was a life that Joseph Bouglione said was like a constant holiday. The day the circus left town In an interview in 2011, Rosa recalled one trip to Brazil, on which they were accompanied by 30 horses, 10 lions, six tigers and a polar bear, among other animals. When the captain of the ship carrying them tried to throw the circus' elephants overboard to reduce the ship's weight during a storm, Joseph threatened to organise a mutiny and so the crew tossed away much of the cargo instead. Elephants make their way from a Paris train station to the Cirque d'Hiver in 1965 after returning from a show in Germany Running the circus was a feat of logistics: 100 trucks full of animals and equipment would have to be unloaded and then reloaded in a day, and 40 tonnes of cloth packed up tidily at the end of each show. And then there was the small matter of managing the animals themselves. There was Jacky the gorilla, who would drink only Perrier water and would make hammocks out of the curtains of any hotels where the troupe stayed. There was the anaconda which would squeeze the most attractive women a little tighter than the others. There was Coco, the foul-mouthed parrot who would fly to the balcony and scream ""Help!"" so loudly the police would come rushing round. The 42-year search for a missing granddaughter The reporter scrubbed from the history books My friend, the dry cleaner of Mogadishu Even as one of the biggest names in the circus world, the family was not always welcome on its travels, as Rosa told France's TF1 network in 2011. They were gypsies by origin, and were often treated with suspicion and subject to allegations as they arrived in a new town. ""I never understood it,"" she said. ""People said we'd steal children. But we never did. We had our own children, we didn't need to steal children. But we just let them say this stuff."" It was the Cirque d'Hiver that provided the platform for some of the family's biggest shows and most notable successes. Among them was La Perle du Bengale, where one performer braved the full force of a whip strike, and damsels in distress fell into pools swarming with snakes. Actors Gina Lollobrigida and Thomas Gomez on the set of the 1956 film Trapeze, filmed at the Cirque d'Hiver Rosa stopped performing and did more work behind the scenes of the circus, and over time, the venue attracted the biggest names from the entertainment world and regularly hosted live TV specials. The actress, singer and black icon Josephine Baker was one, and soprano Maria Callas another. When Callas once got a little too close to Joseph Bouglione, she was almost crushed by an elephant that was wary of women other than Rosa being around him. Rosa and Joseph eventually brought an end to their life on the road, moving in to a house around the corner from the circus in 1984. Joseph died three years later but Rosa remained there until her death, surrounded by reminders of her career. Among them, the pelt of her pet leopard Mickey, that would sit on top of the dining table, his head still attached, seemingly snarling at any visitors. She would still attend matinees into her old age, and would let the performers know her opinion. ""The shows got bigger and the children got bigger, but I got smaller,"" she said. The mother who forgave her daughter's killer The 9/11 rescuers who died a day apart, 17 years on The disgraced sports star who disappeared Entertainment in 2018 is very different to that of the early 20th Century, when Rosa began dancing in the lion's cage. Nowadays, the Cirque d'Hiver is just as well known as a concert venue, or as the setting for political rallies. The industry is also under growing pressure to end the use of live animals - a debate that has arrived in France a little later than in other countries. Before his resignation this week, French environment minister Nicolas Hulot had said he was against the practice, and afterthe shooting to death of a tiger that had escaped from another Paris circus last November, campaigners renewed their calls for a ban on the use of live animals in shows. In 2016, the Bouglione family announced it would no longer use an ageing elephant in its shows after an environmental group accused the circus of mistreating the animal. But the family is divided about whether animals should still be a part of its performances. Last May, one of Rosa and Joseph's grandsons, AndrÃ©, who founded his own circus, said he would end the practice. ""It's because of my love of animals and out of respect for the public that I stopped this,""he told the campaign group 30 Millions d'Amis in an interview,external. ""I saw a survey that said 80% of French people cared about animal rights. Our job is entertaining families. So if a very large majority of families believes this, we can't continue doing something that upsets them."" But another grandson, Francesco, who is now the director of the Cirque d'Hiver, has vowed to continue using animals and has condemned what he calls ""eco-terrorism"". He told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper last year,external: ""We're tired of being tainted by false claims, without mentioning the protests in front of our tents and acts of sabotage. This won't end well."" This video can not be played Mourners gathered at the Cirque d'Hiver to remember Rosa Bouglione's life Rosa Bouglione leaves 55 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren, and a family name which remains above the entrance to the Cirque d'Hiver. In a statement, her family said she was ""the undisputed queen of the circus world"", adding: ""Her passion for the circus stayed with her until the very end."" A new show honouring Rosa's life, named Extra, will begin at the Cirque d'Hiver on 6 October.

Unseen colour photos of London's East End,"A recently discovered photo collection by the late photographer David Granick reveals London's East End in colour, including streets in Stepney, Whitechapel and Spitalfields. Brushfield Street, 1970 Local photographer Chris Dorley-Brown found the pictures when he was invited to review thousands of Granick's colour slides in early 2017. The discovery led to the release of the bookThe East End In Colour, 1960-1980, published by Hoxton Mini Press. Mile End Road, 1977 Granick lived in the East End until his death in 1980 at the age of 68. His photos bring to life a past that was predominantly documented in black and white. The collection was acquired by Tower Hamlets Local History Library & Archives in the early 1980s. Spitalfields Market, 1975 The Granick collection goes back to the 1950s, including the colour Kodachrome images seen here. Dorley-Brown worked with other archivists to create a selection of about 200 of Granick's photos for publication, taking around 10 months. Dorley-Brown said: ""The collection is very comprehensive, I was instantly excited by their sheer quality and beauty, I think this is a very valuable discovery for London's photographic history."" Whitechapel Road, 1965 Watney Market, 1974 The image of the Stifford estate (below) from 1961 is Dorley-Brown's personal favourite because it ""embodies the uncertainty of how the modern tower blocks are going to impact the community from a resident's perspective."" Stifford Estate, Stepney Green, 1961 Despite never meeting Granick, Dorley-Brown believes that the photographer could see an East End London in flux and was anticipating radical transformations in the visual landscape. He thinks he was determined to preserve ""some kind of mysterious aura on film before it disappears."" ""All cities metamorphose over time, surfaces are remade and remapped, buildings are replaced, but somehow an essence of place manages to survive,"" said Dorley-Brown. ""I like to think it is attitudes and resilience of the people that preserves traditions and the way places feel.""

Obituary: The 9/11 rescuers who died a day apart,"New York firefighters turn out for the funeral of Thomas Phelan on Tuesday When Thomas Phelan and Keith Young died within a day of each other last week, it was as a result of cancer, from which both had been suffering. But the underlying cause of the firefighters' deaths was the event which they both witnessed up close 17 years earlier: the 11 September attack on New York. Phelan and Young's names will not be added to the official tally of 2,977 people killed in the attacks, which also targeted the Pentagon and a plane that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Their deaths were, however, a result of what happened at the World Trade Center that September morning. According to records maintained by the Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York (UFANYC) union, theirs were the 172nd and 173rd deaths of firefighters to have occurred because of 9/11-related illnesses, and the sixth and seventh so far this year. Another former New York firefighter, Paul Tokarski, died of what was called a ""WTC-related illness"" on 10 March. Inevitability, sadly, their deaths will not be the last. About 400,000 people are believed to have been exposed to toxic contaminants, or suffered injury or trauma in lower Manhattan that day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The president of the UFANYC told the BBC that roughly one in eight firefighters who were at Ground Zero have since come down with cancer. Thomas Phelan, a firefighting marine pilot, was diagnosed with cancer only two months ago Thomas Phelan was not working for the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) on 9/11, but played a critical role that stood him in good stead for his later career. At the time, he was working as a pilot for the tourist ferry service running between Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. Soon after the attacks on the World Trade Center took place, all transport to and from Manhattan was shut down. Bridges, main roads and tunnels were closed, and people found themselves stranded on Manhattan, with no evacuation plan in place. 9/11 memories from the wreckage What happened next was a mass evacuation by boat that was larger even than what happened in Dunkirk during World War Two. About 500,000 people are estimated to have been taken to safety by boat in only nine hours - the largest evacuation in New York City's history. Over several hours, Phelan carried hundreds of passengers from Manhattan to New Jersey, and transported first responders and supplies close to the ruins of the World Trade Center. ""When everybody was trying to get away, Thomas got that boat in position to help and evacuate,""his friend Bryan Lang told ny1.com,external. ""And what's great is that he never talked about it. You would never ever know what Thomas did."" 9/11's toxic dust legacy 'Dust lady' of 9/11 dies Many of the mariners who took part in the evacuation have since fallen ill - Phelan among them. He stopped working for the Statue of Liberty ferry in May 2003 and joined the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), eventually making his way back on to the water as a pilot on board a firefighting boat. Phelan, who was 45, was diagnosed with lung cancer only two months ago, not long after running his best marathon time. He died on Friday 16 March, and hundreds of firefighters lined the streets of the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Sunset Park for his funeral on Tuesday. Gerard Fitzgerald, the president of the firefighters' union the UFANYC, said Phelan, a friend for more than 25 years, was ""a very talented, very nice, good-hearted guy"". Among others to pay tribute was New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said Phelan's ""heroism saved hundreds of lives"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Keith Young joined the FDNY in 1998 and was stationed in Midwood, Brooklyn on the day of the attacks, when 343 firefighters were killed. He joined the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero, which went on for nine months afterwards. While no emergency workers died during the recovery efforts, working in Ground Zero soon took its toll. The first 9/11-related death of a firefighter registered after the disaster is that of Gary Celentani, who took his own life 14 months after losing many of his close friends. Many others, like Young, were struck down with cancer attributed to the effects of being at the site. He first fell ill in December 2015, three years after his wife Beth died of breast cancer aged 47, and underwent surgery to remove a large tumour from his pelvis. Keith Young was a celebrated chef as well as a firefighter After his treatment, he retired from duty, but died aged 53 on Saturday 17 March. ""He fought so hard and kept believing in miracles,""his daughter Kaley wrote on Facebook after his death,external. ""There are so many adjectives we could use to describe my dad: funny, smart, kind. He was just an incredible human."" While working for the FDNY, he became well-known for his skills in the kitchen, and received a degree in culinary studies. In 2003, he published a book, Cooking With The Firehouse Chef, and he went on to win two titles on the Food Network television show Chopped. He leaves two daughters and a son, and his funeral took place on Saturday. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

According to the CDC,just under 70,000 people who helped during 9/11 have applied for medical aid,externalafter the disaster, as have about 14,300 people who were in New York City at the time. Among the main illnesses treated are chronic coughs, asthma, cancers and depression. In January 2011, the Zadroga Act - named after a police officer who died of a lung disease - was signed into law, authorising a fund for monitoring, treatment and compensation for 9/11 survivors. So far, close to $3.3bn has been paid out. New York's Committee for Occupational Safety & Health says that about 6,000 of the 9/11 first responders are now living with cancer, with thousands more suffering breathing problems or mental health issues. Many, it said, had ""suffered severe exposure to numerous WTC-derived contaminants"". Cancer cases after the World Trade Center attack could be set to rise Gerard Fitzgerald, of the firefighters' union the UFANYC, told the BBC that of the 10,000 active firefighters and 6,000 retirees who attended Ground Zero on or after 9/11, about 2,000 had gone on to suffer some form of cancer. He fears the alarming rate of cancer cases among New York firefighters could soon increase substantially. It's feared that 9/11 first responders were exposed to significant amounts of asbestos, butcancers caused by asbestos exposure rarely emerge until 15 years later,external. ""We are living proof of the 9/11 effects, of that toxic soup we were breathing in,"" said Mr Fitzgerald, who arrived in Manhattan just after the second tower fell, before staying for 40 more hours. ""Every time, the thought goes through your head - could it be me next? Is it inside me? But you can't live like that.""

The 42-year search for a missing grandchild,"Late in life, Maria ""Chicha"" Mariani had hope of a new breakthrough in the search for her granddaughter The assault on the house on 30th Street, led by 100 soldiers and police officers, began in the early afternoon. Within hours, the building in La Plata, Argentina - that had appeared from the outside to be a rabbit farm - was almost destroyed, and all but one of its residents killed. The only one to survive was Clara AnahÃ­ Mariani Teruggi, who was three months old. Witnesses would later say she had been taken from the scene by those who had led the assault. Clara's mother, Diana Teruggi, 25, was among those killed in the raid on 24 November 1976. Behind the fake front of the rabbit farm, she helped run a small printing press. It produced copies of the newspaper for the Montoneros, the left-wing guerrilla group of which she and her husband Daniel Mariani were members. The group, which formed in the 1960s, conducted kidnappings and assassinations, and were targeted under the military junta that seized power in Argentina in March 1976. A little more than eight months after Diana Teruggi was killed, Daniel Mariani too was tracked down and murdered. Their daughter would never be found, but the search would consume the life of Daniel's mother, Maria ""Chicha"" Mariani, until her death on Monday aged 94. Few photos were taken of Clara AnahÃ­ before her disappearance at three months Baby Clara AnahÃ­ was not the only one to disappear in the years after the coup, though the circumstances of how she went missing - snatched during a raid - were unusual. In seven years under military rule up to 1983, at least 500 children were abducted from their mothers in captivity, while about 30,000 people are believed to have been kidnapped and murdered by extremist right-wing groups or the military government. Despite the threat of violence, those left behind - including Clara's grandmother - sought to find the truth. Daniel Mariani and Diana Teruggi's bodies have still not been recovered more than 40 years later In 1977, art history teacher Chicha Mariani and 11 other relatives of the missing began meeting in secret to discuss how to find their grandchildren. It would later emerge that many of the children had been moved into the homes of military members and their allies. ""We were convinced we'd soon find our grandchildren,external,"" Chicha Mariani told Spain's El Pais newspaper in 2015. 'We believed that the government would give them back to us. How naive we were. ""We even bought nappies, thinking that we would get the little ones back at any time."" After those early meetings, the grandmothers started investigating. They would visit orphanages and juvenile courts, look into recent adoptions, and follow tips from the public. In time, they would become known as the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, after the central Buenos Aires square in which they would congregate in front of the government palace. They worked alongside the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had started their own demonstrations in the square, waving white handkerchiefs at those in power. The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo at a demonstration in 1982 The risks of standing up to the government at that time were clear; three of the founding members of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo and two supporters - including a French nun - disappeared in 1977. Tests conducted on their bodies years later indicated they had died after being thrown from a great height, most likely in the Argentine military's ""death flights"", which saw victims thrown from planes into large bodies of water. The search became easier after the end of military rule and with advances in technology. One year after the military was overthrown, an American geneticist helped create a ""Grandparents' Index"" in Argentina that was able to determine genetic links between a grandparent and a grandchild. Then in 1987, under Chicha Mariani's leadership, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo - known as the Abuelas - succeeded in convincing the Argentine government to establish a genetic database for relatives of the disappeared. The database helped reunite dozens of families in its first few years, though Chicha Mariani would not be one of the beneficiaries. The reporter scrubbed from the history books My friend, the dry cleaner of Mogadishu The mother who forgave her daughter's killer The 9/11 rescuers who died a day apart, 17 years on Mariani split with the Abuelas in 1989 and went on to establish the AnahÃ­ Foundation, named after her granddaughter, that helps co-ordinate organ donation and transplants. She also opened a museum in the building in which Diana Teruggi was killed, and from where Clara was taken. Its walls remained riddled with bullet holes from the day of the raid in 1976. All the time, however, Mariani had a theory about what may have happened to her granddaughter. In late 1983, she saw a photograph of a girl in a newspaper and immediately thought she recognised her. The girl, Marcela Noble Herrera, was the daughter of the head of the ClarÃ­n group, Argentina's biggest media company, that had been allied to the military junta. Marcela, along with her brother Felipe, had been adopted in 1976. ""I saw the photos of her in England, France, with presidents and kings, and with the Pope,""Chicha Mariani told the New Yorker in 2012.,external""I watched her grow. She has the same body as my daughter-in-law's mother. And her character seems similar to ours - reserved, modest, sincere, sensitive, and very intelligent."" Marcela Noble Herrera in 2009 After a long legal battle that dominated headlines in Argentina, Felipe and Marcela Noble Herrera agreed to be tested in 2011. Those tests showed there was no genetic link to Chicha Mariani nor to dozens of other relatives of the disappeared. There was little progress in the search for Clara AnahÃ­ in the following years - until a surprise announcement on Christmas Eve 2015. ""After 39 years of tireless searching,"" a statement by the AnahÃ­ Foundation said, Chicha Mariani and her granddaughter had been reunited. DNA tests had established a 99.9% chance that Mariani and a woman from the central CÃ³rdoba province were related, and they were seen smiling and hugging in photographs. The result, Mariani's foundation said at the time, ""fulfills one of the greatest wishes of Argentine society"" and President Mauricio Macri tweeted out his congratulations. The reunion was reported around the world at Christmas in 2015 Two days later, the story began to unravel. It emerged that the tests had been conducted in a private laboratory, and not through the official channels that Mariani and the Abuelas had helped establish. Further tests revealed no matchbetween the two women. Mariani, who was 91 and almost blind, said she was ""devastated"" by the news. Investigators said the woman who had visited Mariani had learned she was not a match several months earlier. Mariani said she believed this had been an attempt to undermine the work of the Abuelas. The groups continues to encourage Argentines who question their origins to undertake DNA testing. To date, they have succeeded in identifying 126 grandchildren who had disappeared. Up to her death, Chicha Mariani had held out hope for her own reunion, and would often tell interviewers: ""I can't afford to die - I have to find my granddaughter."" In a tribute to their co-founder, the Abuelas said they would keep searching for Clara AnahÃ­ on her behalf.

Farming the old-fashioned way,"French farmer Jean-Bernard Huon has shunned modern techniques such as machinery and pesticides, choosing the manual subsistence farming methods once followed by his peasant ancestors. Reuters photographer Stephane Mahe spent seven days with Jean-Bernard and his partner Laurence in Riec-sur-Belon, a corner of southern Brittany on France's west coast, to capture scenes of their unique way of living. Jean-Bernard, 70, describes himself as a ""happy outsider"". He and Laurence milk eight cows by hand, grind flour and collect manure to fertilise the crops that feed his livestock. Jean-Bernard chooses to sell his pork, veal and butter directly to visitors to his farm rather than engage with large supermarkets. Despite his produce being organic, he has even avoided the trend of selling at farmers' markets, where organic food is hugely popular. Jean-Bernard puts the cap back on a barrel of cider, made using apples from the orchard. Laurence adds salt as she makes butter by hand. Jean-Bernard and Laurence use beets as animal feed. The pair enjoy homemade cider as they eat lunch. Farm machinery revolutionised French agriculture after World War Two, but Jean-Bernard chose to continue using the traditional manual farming methods. As the country modernised around him, he continued to plough fields with oxen and has no TV, internet, running hot water or a car. ""I've always managed by myself - I've never been rich but what do I care?"" Jean-Bernard told photographer Mahe. ""Farmers today have a lot more land and animals than me, but they're not necessarily happier. They face a lot of constraints."" Jean-Bernard laughs with a friend who helps harvest beets. He does not oppose modern farmers and their methods. ""People criticise and it's good to criticise, but you have to know why it came about. Chemicals were a liberation for farmers. Can you imagine? You apply some glyphosate and you don't have any more weeds. Otherwise you have to do it with the hoe."" Jean-Bernard has had to make some concessions to modernity as he has grown older, investing in two tractors to help with the heavy lifting of hay. Jean-Bernard's great-grandparents were the first of his family to work on the farm - his family are pictured here in about 1910. Jean-Bernard wants to donate his farm to a willing successor, rather than sell it. But he admits his traditional methods may not be adopted by the future owner. ""I lived in a time when you could set up easily,"" he says. ""You just had to have some land and you could produce."" Photos byStephane Mahe,external. Â© 2025 BBC.

The man who 'discovered' China's terracotta army,"When archaeologist Zhao Kangmin picked up the phone in April 1974, all he was told was that a group of farmers digging a well nearby had found some relics. Desperate for water amid a drought, the farmers had been digging about a metre down when they struck hard red earth. Underneath, they had found life-size pottery heads and several bronze arrowheads. It could be an important find, Zhao's boss said, so he should go and have a look as soon as possible. A local farmer-turned-museum curator in China's central Shaanxi province, Zhao - who died on 16 May at the age of 81 - had an inkling of what he might find. He knew figures had in the past been dug out of the earth in the area near the city of Xian, home to orchards of persimmon and pomegranate trees, and not far from the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. A decade earlier, he had personally uncovered three kneeling crossbowmen. But he had never been certain that they dated back to the rule of the emperor - who unified the Chinese nation for the first time under the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BC). But what Zhao was about to find would surpass anything he could have imagined. The farmers, it would turn out, had stumbled upon one of the most stunning archaeological finds of the 20th Century: a  terracotta army estimated at 8,000-strong, crafted on an industrial scale 2,200 years earlier to defend the emperor in the afterlife. A ghost army, complete with horses and chariots, hidden underground and never meant to be seen by the living. Zhao headed to the location of the find with a colleague. ""Because we were so excited, we rode on our bicycles so fast it felt as if we were flying,"" he would later write in a 2014 essay. As he arrived, Zhao told the British historian John Man: ""I saw seven or eight pieces - bits of legs, arms and two heads - lying near the well, along with some bricks."" Zhao Kangmin died on 16 May at the age of 81 He said he immediately realised these were likely the remnants of Qin-era statues. The farmers - who had made the find weeks earlier and already sold some of the bronze arrowheads for scrap - were told to stop their work immediately. The relics were collected and brought to the museum on the back of trucks. Zhao began laboriously putting the fragments together. Some, he later said, were the size of a fingernail. Finally, after three days of work, two imposing terracotta warriors stood before him - each 1.78m tall. But while Zhao was buoyed by this incredible discovery, he was also nervous. China in 1974 was in the closing stages of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - under which the fearsome Red Guards sought to destroy old traditions and ways of thinking to ""purify"" society. Archaeologists at the site in 1979 - Zhao is not pictured Zhao, as Man recounts in his book The Terracotta Army, had personally been subject to a ""self-criticism"" session in the late 1960s, as a person ""involved with old things"". So now although the worst excesses of that period were over, Zhao was worried what might become of the statues. He ""decided to keep it secret"", restore the artefacts, ""and then wait for the right opportunity to report it"". But those plans would be scuppered by a young journalist from state news agency Xinhua, who was visiting the area when he came across the statues. ""He asked: 'This is such a huge discovery. Why aren't you reporting it?'"" Zhao wrote. To which the archaeologist replied: ""Even I don't know how to make sense of this. How could I report it?"" Ignoring his pleas, the journalist publicised the find, and word made its way to the very top of the Communist Party leadership. Zhao's fears that the relics could be smashed for political reasons, however, proved unfounded. The authorities in Beijing decided to excavate the site and within a few months more than 500 warriors had been uncovered. This video can not be played Witness: The greatest archaeological find of the 20th Century As the work continued, the extraordinary scale of what the First Emperor - a ruthless man who defeated six warring states to unite China under an imperial system that continued until 1912 - had commissioned became clear. He is said to have ordered the subterranean project - which in total covers some 56 sq km - soon after ascending to the throne at 13 years old. The thousands of warriors were placed in battle formation, ready to defend their emperor from whatever might await in the afterlife. The workmanship was detailed, with dozens of different types of heads, and in the burial pits were 100 chariots and tens of thousands of bronze weapons. The actual tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang remains sealed. There could be thousands of precious artefacts inside but the risks of opening the tomb, and irreparably damaging what may lie inside, means the Chinese government has held off so far. In 1975, a year after the excavations began, a decision was made to open a museum at the site. And as digging continued in the coming years, word spread about the scale of what had been found. Foreign dignitaries and some tourists began to visit. Zhao was there and lapping up the attention, says Prof Dame Jessica Rawson of the University of Oxford, who specialises in Chinese art and archaeology and visited the sites in the early 1980s. ""By the time I met him everyone was showing him great respect and he was very much sort of enjoying the esteem associated with the terracotta warriors,"" she said. But the professor added: ""I'm not sure how he or the Chinese authorities viewed it at the time. They were probably not expecting the acclaim and success that it has later enjoyed."" Queen Elizabeth II was among dignitaries to visit in the 1980s It did take some years for the site to receive widespread global recognition. It was givenUnesco World Heritage status,externalin 1987, with the UN cultural body describing the warriors as ""masterpieces of realism"". Today, the site is widely recognised as a Chinese national treasure. But there is a sense that Zhao's personal role in the discovery was never fully recognised. He is by no means well-known in China. The teacher who saved hundreds of lives The sergeant in the only all-female, all-black WW2 unit The 9/11 rescuers who died a day apart, 17 years on The disgraced rugby star who disappeared Instead, one of the farmers - Yang Zhifa, whose shovel is said to have unearthed the first artefact  - is described to visiting tourists as the person who discovered the warriors. For years he sat in the Museum of the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, quietly and unsmilingly signing books. It was he, not Zhao, who travelled abroad to tell his story. In 1998, when then US President Bill Clinton visited, it was Yang who shook his hand. Zhao handed out this business card to visitors A few years ago he admitted that he didn't go and see the restored army until 1995,external, when the museum gift shop manager asked him to sign books. ""He said he would pay me 300 yuan a month. I thought 'that's not bad', so I came,"" he told the China Daily. Three other farmers would later join him, and their pay was tripled. But all complained they were never rewarded properly for their find, and in fact had their land seized to make way for the museum. Three of the original group of seven farmers died in terrible circumstances.,externalOne hanged himself in 1997, and two others died in their early 50s, penniless and unable to pay for medical care, according to the South China Morning Post. A local guide who brings tourists to see the warriors, Liu Guoyang, had not even heard of Zhao Kangmin. But he said imposters posed for visitors, pretending to be Yang Zhifa or one of the other farmers. Excavations continue in the pits where the figures are buried Zhao was furious when, in 2004, the four surviving farmers officially asked to be registered as the men who had discovered the warriors. They didn't receive a response. ""What they want is money,"" Zhao told the China Daily. ""Seeing doesn't mean discovering. The farmers saw the terracotta fragments, but they didn't know they were cultural relics, and they even broke them. ""It was me who stopped the damage, collected the fragments and reconstructed the first terracotta warrior,"" he said. If he hadn't have turned up, he told John Man, ""it would have been a disaster"". Wu Yongqi, head of the Museum of the Teracotta Warriors from 1998-2007, agreed that Zhao, who he described as a simple but kind man, was the person who ""recognised the significance and true value of those warriors"". Without him, Mr Wu said, the extraordinary find might have been delayed for years. Unlike the farmers, who signed books for hordes of tourists at the main warriors' museum, Zhao remained at the much smaller Lintong county museum. Even in his final years, he could be found sitting next to some warriors he had restored, wearing a trilby hat and chatting to curious visitors. Although he never achieved fame or fortune, Zhao seemed content with the recognition he did receive - proudly saying that during the initial excavation an envoy from Beijing had told him that he had ""made a very big contribution to the country"". In 1990, he was personally acknowledged by the State Council and given a special pension. He is survived by a wife and two sons. Zhao's view of his own position in Chinese history - no matter what others might say - was clear. At the Lintong museum, he would sign postcards and books for tourists with an extravagant description: ""Zhao Kangmin, the first discoverer, restorer, appreciator, name-giver and excavator of the terracotta warriors.""

"Mourning my friend, the dry cleaner of Mogadishu","Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, has been described as the most dangerous city in the world. But some people there are trying to bring life back to the place. During her regular visits, BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper came to know one of them - an entrepreneur named Mohamed Mahamoud Sheikh. Then she received some bad news. The last time I saw Mohamed, he gave me flowers. He chose one of the biggest and most colourful bunches from the display in his florist's shop. Next door, machines whirred at a dry cleaners - which also belonged to him. Stopping off to see Mohamed was always one of my favourite things to do when I visited Mogadishu. While the world's media spoke of famine, pirates and suicide bombs, he quietly and determinedly got on with his life, bringing what many would see as entirely normal, mundane services back to his country. He also encouraged others. He set up a community of people involved in start-ups, and became something of an inspirational figure - but always remained modest. Lots of brave new businesses have sprung up, from the young man with a motorbike who has started a food delivery business to the girl who has set herself up as a mechanic. Visiting Mohamed in Mogadishu was not entirely straightforward. As for all my other appointments in the city, I never fixed a precise time. Sometimes I would just show up outside the metal gates of the Somalia Premium Laundry on the busy Maka al-Mukarama road. I always travelled there with heavy security - at least six bodyguards in one vehicle, a couple more in the other. It is best to be unpredictable - people say phone calls are listened in on and that there are informants everywhere. But taking care with information and security is no guarantee of safety. Earlier this month, Mohamed was driving in his car in full daylight in a heavily guarded area, known as Kilometre Five. Two men appeared and shot him. This unassuming but influential young man died later in hospital. So far, his murderers have not been caught. Now Mohamed won't be able to realise the other dreams he told me about - of opening a gym, a playground for children, of growing all the flowers for his shop in the fertile fields of Afgoye, not far from Mogadishu. He dreamed of greening the city and had already brought in flowering trees to plant there. Somali social media was soon awash with comments from people whose lives he had touched. Many were accompanied by the hashtag #WeAreNotSafe. Three days after he died, a rare demonstration was held in Mogadishu. Young people wearing white headbands held up banners emblazoned with phrases like ""Stop Killing Youth"". They asked how and why people like Mohamed were being killed, and why nobody was being held accountable. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST On that very same day, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in the city, killing at least three people. I first heard about Mohamed when a friend called to tell me about someone who'd given up a safe, well-paid job in Dubai to return home and set up the first dry cleaners in Mogadishu for more than two decades. I thought this would make a great story - Somalis like Mohamed, who'd lived in peaceful countries abroad, coming home to rebuild their nation. The dry cleaning element also appealed. Every time I flew out of Mogadishu, politicians and businessmen would board the plane carrying vast piles of dirty suits to be cleaned in neighbouring countries. Once at a summit held in Ethiopia's most luxurious hotel, I was astonished to see Somalia's top politicians marching down the corridors with armloads of freshly dry-cleaned suits. Mohamed had spotted an excellent business opportunity. His murder has thrown up questions about the nature of violence in Somalia. About who is killing who. People often rush to blame the Islamist group al-Shabab which for more than a decade has spread terror in Somalia and beyond. But the jihadists are not the only killers. It could be a politician who doesn't like what you do or say, a business rivalâ¦ or caused by a property dispute, or plain jealousy. People are quick to reach for their guns in Somalia. I have been stuck in traffic jams where the guard in my car has rolled down the window and fired live bullets into the air, just to get the other vehicles moving. Mohamed was not the only rising young star to have his life cruelly cut short. Abbas Abdullahi grew up in a refugee camp and was named a government minister last year. He was shot dead accidentally by the then-auditor general's bodyguards. Young journalists are murdered on a regular basis. It seems strange that, with all the billions spent on security in Somalia, the presence of tens of thousands of African Union troops, US drones and special forces, there is little protection for people like Mohamed. I keep catching myself thinking about him - about our friendship, his welcoming gap-toothed smile and his unswerving commitment to making life better. I wonder about his businesses. Are they standing empty now, the dry cleaning machines quiet and still, the flowers wilting? Is anybody watering the pots of plants he tended so carefully and sold to people trying to bring a bit of brightness into the homes and businesses they are rebuilding in Mogadishu?

Bangladesh opposition demands new poll,"This video can not be played There were violent scenes outside polling stations Bangladesh's opposition has condemned what it has called a ""farcical"" election and demanded a new vote. PM Sheikh Hasina is heading for a fourth term with a huge majority that continues to grow as results come in. But there have been claims of vote-rigging, and a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre before polls opened. ""We urge the election commission to void this farcical result immediately,"" opposition leader Kamal Hossain said. ""We are demanding that a fresh election is held under a neutral government as early as possible."" Bangladesh grows tired of its battling leading ladies More on life in Bangladesh The Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters news agency that it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009, but one of the leading opposition parties has accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. A spokesman for the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) alleged there were ""irregularities"" in 221 of the 300 seats being contested. Soon before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second-largest city of the country. Voters queue in the capital, Dhaka At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. Activists, observers and the opposition party had warned that the vote would not be fair, but the governing party accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations. On the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka As we went from polling booth to polling booth, one pattern became clear. People who were supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's party were vocal, and happy to answer our questions on camera, about what issues they'd voted on. The others were mostly too scared to speak out. One man told us that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified It wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed. No-one from the opposition parties was visible. While the election commission has said it will investigate claims of vote-rigging, the organisation has itself been accused of bias by the opposition. So far, the prime minister has not responded to these latest allegations but two days ago rejected claims the election was unfair. It is widely anticipated that her party will win the polls, but it will be a controversial victory. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Sheikh Hasina's long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, did not stand in the election. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

Dinnage pulls out of Premier League role,"Dinnage wants to stay in broadcasting at Discovery The Premier League says its prospective new chief executive, Susanna Dinnage, has told the organisation she will not be taking up the position. She wasnamed as Richard Scudamore's replacementin November and was due to take up the role early in 2019. ""The committee has reconvened its search and is talking to candidates,""said a Premier League statement.,external Dinnage will stay at media organisation Discovery, where she was the global president of the Animal Planet channel. She had reflected on the role in recent weeks and informed the Premier League that she had decided that she wanted to stay in broadcasting. She apparently had not given a precise start date as she had a long notice period to serve. The Premier League is comfortable with acting chief executive Richard Masters and interim chair Claudia Arney continuing for longer as they resume their search. Prior to joining Discovery in January 2009, Dinnage worked for 10 years at Channel Five and she started her career at MTV. This is a surprise snub to the Premier League - and especially embarrassing for Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who led the search for former supremo Richard Scudamore's replacement. It comes at a critical time for English football's top clubs and, while Dinnage is yet to explain her decision, it may well be the daunting scale of the task facing her played a role in her U-turn. Perhaps the scrutiny over Scudamore's controversial Â£5m pay-off also made her reconsider. Sports TV audience habits are clearly shifting and, with a decrease in the value of the latest domestic TV rights deal and new digital challengers emerging in the market, her experience of tough negotiations at Discovery would have been useful. With Brexit looming, whoever is drafted in now will have to manage strained relations with the FA over homegrown player quotas, and contend with the biggest clubs jostling for more of a share of overseas TV revenue.

Singer's crying selfie prompts talk pleaBessie Turner says there is often more to people's lives than their perfect social media profile.Suffolk,"Bessie Turner said the pressure to ""keep up with the pace of life"" was overwhelming for people A musician praised for posting a selfie of her crying says it is important people feel comfortable speaking about their mental health. Bessie Turner, a 25-year-old singer-songwriter from Ipswich, posted the photo on Instagram along with a message urging people to seek help if needed. One comment said she was providing ""comfort to all who struggle"". Turner said she was not seeking sympathy but wanted to let people know they were not alone. Since releasing her debut single at the start of 2017, Turner has toured Germany and the UK, played numerous music festivals, and received support from BBC DJs including Jo Whiley, Steve Lamacq, Huw Stephens and Zoe Ball. Her Instagram feed has chronicled this rise, and a quick glance at the photos paints the picture of a perfect life. But in the post of her crying, published on World Mental Health Day on 10 October, Turner said she had taken the photo shortly after she began taking anti-depressants. ""It's just as relevant as all the others of me smiling and singing and feeling like a hot mama that rules the world,"" she wrote.

Excitement ahead of distant Nasa flyby,"This video can not be played Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule. The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements. At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body. The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT. It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data. Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday. Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby ""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence. ""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away."" Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out. ""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters. The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima. With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components. New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment. Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth. But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home. The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second. This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images. Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima. ""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing."" Children invited to mission control celebrate the moment of closest approach When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface. Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May. The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images. ""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in."" Allow Twitter content?

Bellfield linked to 'paedophile network',"Levi Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, will never be released from prison Serial killer Levi Bellfield was part of a child sex gang that has never been brought to justice, a report claims. The 50-year-old was jailed for life in 2011 for murdering 13-year-old Milly Dowler and two women. The report by senior social worker Debbie Weissang sent to the Met Police linked Bellfield with six men accused of paedophilia, murder and grooming. Ms Weissang said she was ""deeply concerned there remained a risk to children"" from Bellfield's associates. Levi Bellfield admits Milly Dowler murder Milly Dowler torment revealed by family Bellfield ruled out of further cases Milly's sister: We have a chance to be happy Bellfield was handed a whole life sentence after confessing to Milly's murder. He had already been given life sentences in 2008 for the murders of AmÃ©lie Delagrange, a 22-year-old French student, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell. Milly Dowler was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002 Ms Weissang, the former child sexual exploitation manager at Hillingdon Council in West London, wrote her report on Bellfield, who had lived in the authority's area, in December 2017. Ms Weissang said that despite Bellfield being ""locked away"" there were ""six other men"" who were not serving life sentences and ""pose a serious threat to children"". She added she wanted the Dowler family to know there were ""many people that are working really hard to make a difference for the survivors"". Debbie Weissang said she wanted Milly's parents Bob and Sally Dowler to know ""there are many people that are working really hard to make a difference for the survivors"" Other alleged gang members include Victor Kelly and Suraj Gharu, who have both been convicted of child sex offences, and a third man who was found guilty of murder. However, Ms Weissang believes the other three members of the gang remain in the community, though they may have been arrested since the report. A Met Police Spokesman said: ""A safeguarding report was received from Hillingdon Council. ""Any allegations of Child Sexual Exploitation contained in the report will be assessed and be investigated where appropriate."" A spokesman for Hillingdon Council added: ""Following completion of the report the information was carefully reviewed by Hillingdon Council's Head of Safeguarding in partnership with the Metropolitan Police to ensure a timely and proportionate response. ""A dedicated police resource was also assigned to review the information. Hillingdon Council's Children's Social Care team conducted numerous safeguarding checks including liaison with all relevant agencies.""

UK and France to step up Channel patrols,"The UK and France are to step up joint patrols and increase surveillance to tackle a rise in the number of migrants trying to reach Britain in small boats. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who has cut short a family holiday, agreed a joint action plan with the French interior minister during a phone call. Six more Iranian men were found on a beach near Dover on Sunday morning. The National Crime Agency said French authorities prevented a further attempt to cross the Channel on Saturday night. Mr Javid has come under growing pressure to act, with Labour accusing the Home Office of a ""flawed"" strategy and one Conservative MP urging Mr Javid to ""get a grip"". Following a call with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, the Home Office said the pair agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" to be put in place in the coming week. It includes disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The Home Office did not give details of how this would be done. Currently, only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. The Home Office did not say whether the other four cutters would now be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol waters off England's south coast. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' Since November, more than 220 people have attempted to cross the Channel in small boats. They include six men, all Iranian nationals, who were found on a beach at Kingsdown, near Deal, in Kent, on Sunday morning. They have been transferred to immigration officials. Compared to the number of refugees seeking asylum in the UK every year, the number who have attempted to cross the channel by dinghy is tiny, says BBC political correspondent Ben Wright. In 2017, 26,350 people applied for asylum, an average of about 2,200 a month. Six men were found on Kingsdown beach on Sunday The group was found alongside a rigid-hulled inflatable boat Mr Javid was expected to be back in the UK in time to chair a meeting on Monday with senior government officials, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency. On Twitter, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner confirmedhe had spoken by phone to Mr Javid,external, and that they were working together ""to combat Channel crossings"". In atweet,external, Mr Javid thanked him for the ""partnership"", saying the UK and France would ""build on our joint efforts to deter illegal immigration - protecting our borders and human life"". The two are expected to meet face-to-face in January to assess whether further action is required. Many of the migrants are thought to be Iranian or Syrian. A BBC South East investigation last month found that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. One man from Afghanistan told the BBC that there was ""a rush"" and ""everyone is talking about it, saying we need to get in quick in case the security gets tighter"". Watch the BBC South East investigation footage One refugee group said they believed most of those trying to cross wereKurdish peoplefrom Iran. Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said they could have genuine asylum claims and should not have to ""risk their lives"". She said the government needed to find a way to process their claims in France instead - and then transfer them. This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 She said it was ""a miracle"" that there had been no fatalities, as although the weather had been settled, the boats used to transport migrants were ""entirely unsuitable"" and the water was extremely cold. ""I've seen pictures of people with no lifejackets on - it's terrifying,"" she said. ""I hope the government can find the political will to make sure we don't have people drowning off the coast of the UK."" Ms Chapman thought more people were using boats as security had been tightened around Calais, making it more difficult for people to use lorries on ferries or trains. The mild weather may also have encouraged more to try the sea route, she said. Chris Hogben, from the National Crime Agency, said it was new to see this level of Iranian migration and these groups would be paying serious organised criminals ""quite a bit of money"" to get across. He said his officers were also seeing more migrants organise the crossing themselves, either by buying or stealing a boat, and he expected to see more attempts using that method in the coming weeks. Some MPs have called for more vessels to be deployed in the Channel, but Mr Javid said it was ""vital we strike a balance between protecting [migrants] and protecting our borders"". The home secretary said he wanted to avoid encouraging more people to take the risk of attempting the crossing and was keeping the number of cutters ""under close review"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn said in a tweet,external: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said the Home Office's strategy was ""flawed"", with the ""focus on deterring refugees, thinking that the issues in the Mediterranean would never reach our shores"". Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said he wanted to work with France to find the safe houses where people were being trafficked to, as well as identify where the traffickers are getting their boats from and stop them setting off for England. ""If we don't act and stop it now, sooner or later there's a great risk of a tragedy in the middle of the English Channel,"" he said.

No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried,"Concerns have been raised over the readiness of a British firm contracted by the government to run extra ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Seaborne Freight was awarded a Â£13.8m contract this weekto run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend. The firm has never run a ferry service and a local councillor said it would be impossible to launch before Brexit. The government said it had awarded the contract in ""the full knowledge that Seaborne is a new shipping provider"". The Department for Transport said that ""the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services"". ""As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company's commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award,"" it added. UK to spend Â£103m on no-deal ferries Brexit: A really simple guide Firms told to prepare for no-deal Brexit 'Six months of jams' under no-deal Brexit Conservative Kent county councillor Paul Messenger said it was impossible for the government to have carried out sufficient checks on the firm. ""It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done?"" he asked. Paul Messenger says Seaborne is a perplexing choice Mr Messenger said he didn't believe that it was possible to set up a new ferry service between Ramsgate and Ostend by 29 March - the date when the UK is due to leave the European Union. The narrow berths for ships at the Port of Ramsgate mean there are only a few suitable commercial vessels, most of which are currently already in service, he said. Ferry services have not operated from Ramsgate Port since 2013 after cross-channel operator TransEuropa collapsed, owing around Â£3.3m to Thanet District Council. Mr Messenger said he was ""perplexed"" at the choice of Seaborne Freight to run the service. ""Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them Â£14m? I don't understand the logic of that,"" he said. But Seaborne Freight, which was formed less than two years ago to revive the Ramsgate-Ostend line, insisted it will launch its freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend before 29 March. UK ports face 'major disruption', MPs warn Brexit: Exports 'could be stuck at border' Chief executive Ben Sharp said the firm had been founded by seasoned shipping veterans. He declined to give details on which ships it planned to use for the service, saying the information was commercially sensitive, but said they planned to start operations with two ships before ""very quickly"" increasing to four by late summer. He said dredging in Ramsgate Port would start on 4 January in preparation for the freight service. The firm said it had originally intended to start the service in mid-February but this had now been delayed until late March for operational reasons. It said directors and shareholders had been working during the past two years to restart the service. ""This phase has included locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure, as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating,"" the firm's statement added. The government has also awarded additional, much larger ferry contracts to French company Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, worth Â£46.6m and Â£42.5m (â¬47.3m) respectively. The new contracts are part of the government's contingency planning, which aims to ease the potential for severe congestion at main port Dover if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. The department has warned that increased border checks by EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit could ""cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed"", and ""significant wider disruption to the UK economy and to the road network in Kent"". By Joe Miller, BBC business correspondent The government has for some time now acknowledged that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, contingency plans at ports other than Dover would need to be in place. But it appears that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's department only started awarding contracts to shipping firms a few weeks ago, with no time left, it says, for a full public tender process. And while the two large international firms enlisted to provide extra capacity have existing fleets and large operations, Seaborne does not, and has given few details on how it will get a service up and running in a matter of months. The Department for Transport also wasn't too keen on making much noise about these plans - it quietly posted notices of the awards on an EU portal on Christmas Eve, and the BBC was only alerted to them by a data firm, Tussell. And it's worth noting that without the award to Seaborne, the government would be in a position where the two beneficiaries of a no-deal Brexit were a Danish and a French firm - based, of course, in the EU. The Department for Transport says the new contracts will provide ""significant extra capacity"" to UK ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, The BBC understands that the three firms chosen are likely to retain a portion of their award even if their services are no longer needed, due to a deal being reached with Brussels. However, in that event, the government would then seek to sell the extra capacity back to the market. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: ""Never has it been clearer that our government is selling us down the river over Brexit. ""A firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multi-million pound contract and they don't even have any ships. This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day."" Ed Davey, home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said reports that the government had signed a contract with ""a ferry company with no ferries"" summed up the government's ""farcical"" approach to Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March - following the result of the 2016 referendum. It and the EU have agreed a withdrawal agreement - or ""divorce deal"" - and a political declaration outlining ambition for future talks - but it needs to be agreed by Parliament for it to come into force. A vote by MPs on the deal had been scheduled for 11 December, but Prime Minister Theresa May postponed it until January when it became clear her deal would be rejected, leading to widespread anger in the Commons.

Traffickers 'rush to beat Brexit',"This video can not be played Footage shows people smuggling plans over Channel crossing People smugglers are telling migrants that they must enter the UK before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit, a BBC South East investigation found. More than 100 people, the majorityclaiming to be Iranian, have entered British waters in boats this month. An undercover reporter found smuggling operations were being organised at makeshift camps in northern France. Authorities said they wanted to stop a repeat of the Mediterranean crisis in which2,000 migrants drowned this year,external. ""When [the] UK is out of Europe, the borders will be shut properly,"" a smuggler told an undercover reporter posing as an Iranian migrant at a camp in Dunkirk. ""This jungle will be cleared. They will put everyone in jail."" An Afghan, who gave his name as Farhad, told the BBC that he was part of a failed attempt to enter the UK on board a dinghy with 11 others. ""There is a rush,"" he said. ""Everyone is talking about it saying we need to get in quick in case the security gets tighter."" Fahrad, an Afghani migrant, said ""we need to get in quick"" The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on29 March 2019. A smuggler, who said he had been a fisherman in Iran, was filmed by a hidden camera planning a crossing. ""A boat, it'll cost you Â£3,000 to Â£4,000,"" he said. ""I am taking three people with me, they pay in cash. We get a boat and off we go."" British and French authorities have said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? Toddler among nine rescued from dinghy Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Migrants told the BBC they had paid Â£6,000 each for their place on a dinghy. They were told that crossing the Channel would be like playing a computer game. ""This part of the journey is like defeating the last monster, it is hard, very hard,"" the undercover reporter was told. Migrants were rescued from a dinghy in French waters on 25 November Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing through the world's busiest shipping lane - a journey thatpolice have likenedto trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Not all boats that depart succeed in reaching the UK, and at least 30 migrants have been intercepted in French waters since 23 November. Pierre Henri Dumont, a Les RÃ©publicains politician in Calais, said migrants were ""risking their lives every night here in Calais"". ""We need to face the truth,"" he said ""The truth is, we cannot stop everyone."" The Home Office said that Immigration Enforcement and Border Force were ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"".

Fox: Brexit is 50-50 if May's deal rejectedThe international trade secretary says rejecting the PM's deal would shatter the electorate's trust.UK Politics,"Senior Brexiteer minister Liam Fox says there is a 50-50 chance the UK will not leave the EU on 29 March if MPs reject Theresa May's Brexit deal next month. The international trade secretarytold the Sunday Times,externalit would only be ""100% certain"" if MPs back the deal. He said if the deal is rejected, that ""would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament"". MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in January, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March. The agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force with a majority backing in Parliament. The Commons vote was due to be held on 11 December but the PM postponed it once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this week urged Mrs May to cut short MPs' Christmas break - they are due back in the Commons on 7 January - toallow for an earlier vote. Brexit: A really simple guide Recall MPs for Brexit vote, Corbyn urges Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit Mr Fox has warned fellow MPs that failure to pass the deal would be ""incendiary"" and said it was ""a matter of honour"" for them to support the PM. He said: ""What you can be sure of is that if we vote for the prime minister's deal then it's 100% certain that we will leave on 29 March. ""If we do not vote for that, I'm not sure I would give it much more than 50-50. ""And, for me, that would induce a sense that we had betrayed the people that had voted in the referendum."" Please upgrade your browser Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""The only thing that is shattering the bond of trust between electorate and Parliament is the refusal of ministers like Liam Fox to trust people with the final say on Brexit."" If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has urged the UK to ""get your act together and then tell us what it is you want"" for Brexit. Speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, he said it was ""unreasonable"" for parts of the British public to expect Brussels to solve ""British problems"". Mr Juncker also rejected the idea that the EU wanted to keep the UK in the EU ""by all possible means"" and suggested the majority of MPs ""deeply distrust"" the EU and Theresa May.

Check out Saj Chowdhury's report onManchester United's third straight win here. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola suggesting thatPremier League leaders Liverpool may be the best team in the world right now. And finally,your prediction on how the Premier League table will look come May. Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Manchester United Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said:""You have to enjoy sitting and watching the boys express
themselves. The work rate is second to none and the biggest compliment you can
get as a manager is watching them work so hard because that is our
foundation. The boys know they are playing at Man United which means they are
skillful players and a Man United team should never be outworked. ""Training sessions have
been high quality, the tempo and sharpness has been really good but we will get
better and we are working towards a clean sheet. Everyone just thinks I am
looking for attacking football, but the foundation of any team is how well you
defend, if you keep a clean sheet, you have a good chance of winning the game. ""Eric Bailly is excited of course because he is back in the team and he wants to prove himself, but he has timed the tackle wrong
and he knows it himself, so we will have to do without him for a few games."" Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Bournemouth Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe told BBC Match of the Day:""It was disappointing technically and defensively but I think we have to look at ourselves and think we
could have got more from the game. We have had a difficult run of games and had some injuries, and
maybe we have had a loss of confidence
because of that, but we won't make excuses and we have to work hard to turn it
around. ""Ultimately, I still believe we are a good team but we are in a difficult moment so these next few games are going to be very important. We needed another goal to bring about some
nerves for them but it didnât happen. We will wait to see the extent of Nathan Ake's injury."" Bournemouth are still solidly mid-table despite a rotten run of form has seen them lose eight of their last 10 games in all competitions. The top four is still eight points away for Manchester United. Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Bournemouth Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was a tough game and a disappointing performance form us. We were technically below the level we're usually at and we got punished. ""We have to regroup, refocus and put things right in our next few games. ""I always believed that we could come back and we had a few moments in the first half, but the second half was a non-event from us and that's disappointing. ""It's all about getting one result and building some momentum back. We've been on an incredibly difficult run of fixtures. We've had wins that we hoped would be the catalyst but now we need to try to get another result."" Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Manchester United Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, speaking to Sky Sports:""In the first half we attacked the game with a high tempo and
high energy but the response to their goal was great. We managed the game much
better than against Huddersfield. ""We are still looking for a clean sheet - you canât switch off for
one second in this league. ""Itâs a very very good performance, the crowd was enjoying it
but now Newcastle, the next one, is a different kind of test. ""Marcus Rashford has been different class since I came. His work rate
is unbelievable., He chases, closes down, runs in behind and his skill for Paulâs
goal was great. Heâs got all the chances in the world and the potential to be
a top striker. ""Eric Bailly knows itâs a rash challenge [for his red card] but the boys are excited
and want to win the ball back and sometimes you mistime challenges."" Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Manchester United Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera told BBC Match of the Day:""We have won the last three games but I do not like to make comparisons. I am very thankful to Jose (Mourinho) for what he did to the club. Now we are in a different moment and we have a new manager and that is it. We are in a good moment and everyone is playing very well. Our attacking players are enjoying it and they are making it easier for the rest of the players. ""Our manager told us on the first day, the best way to win a game when you are in the lead is to keep attacking and this is what the club has always been about. The best way to defend is to keep the ball and keep attacking. ""When you win and score lots of goals you want to play as soon as possible and I hope we perform on Wednesday against Newcastle as we have today. We are still sixth but we should not be because of the quality we have."" Man Utd 4-1 Bournemouth Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is just fronting up to the media. He says that his team is still searching for defensive solidity to go with their attacking intent. No side have kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier
     League this season than Manchester United who, like Fulham, have managed only two.

"Bangladesh opposition demand new electionAn opposition leader condemned what he called a ""farcical result"", amid claims of vote rigging.","This video can not be played There were violent scenes outside polling stations Bangladesh's opposition has condemned what it has called a ""farcical"" election and demanded a new vote. PM Sheikh Hasina is heading for a fourth term with a huge majority that continues to grow as results come in. But there have been claims of vote-rigging, and a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre before polls opened. ""We urge the election commission to void this farcical result immediately,"" opposition leader Kamal Hossain said. ""We are demanding that a fresh election is held under a neutral government as early as possible."" Bangladesh grows tired of its battling leading ladies More on life in Bangladesh The Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters news agency that it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009, but one of the leading opposition parties has accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. A spokesman for the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) alleged there were ""irregularities"" in 221 of the 300 seats being contested. Soon before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second-largest city of the country. Voters queue in the capital, Dhaka At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. Activists, observers and the opposition party had warned that the vote would not be fair, but the governing party accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations. On the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka As we went from polling booth to polling booth, one pattern became clear. People who were supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's party were vocal, and happy to answer our questions on camera, about what issues they'd voted on. The others were mostly too scared to speak out. One man told us that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified It wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed. No-one from the opposition parties was visible. While the election commission has said it will investigate claims of vote-rigging, the organisation has itself been accused of bias by the opposition. So far, the prime minister has not responded to these latest allegations but two days ago rejected claims the election was unfair. It is widely anticipated that her party will win the polls, but it will be a controversial victory. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Sheikh Hasina's long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, did not stand in the election. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

Whitfield starred alongside Terry Scott in the hit 1970s sitcom Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy. Often playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself ""a comic's tart"". But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was ""very bad at getting round to things"". But from her early radio appearances in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she featured in more than 1,300 radio and television shows.

China says it is 'ready to work with US',"Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are trying to solve a trade tariff war China has said it is ""ready to work"" with the US, suggesting progress in trade talks between the two countries. It said it would be willing to work with the US to ""implement the important consensus"" reached at December's G20. At the Buenos Aires summit the two countries agreed to suspend new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. China's statement comes afterPresident Donald Trump tweeted ""big progress""was being made in relations after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Allow Twitter content?

In Saturday's tweet, the US president said ""talks were moving along very well"". Sunday's statement from Lu Kang, the spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry, appeared to confirm President Trump's optimism. ""China stands ready to work with the US to implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Trump in Argentina, expand co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect,"" Mr Lu said. Prior to the G20 meeting in Argentina,the US had warned it was considering25% tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods - more than double the 10% initially planned. The White House says the tariffs are a response to China's unfair trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit. Mr Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to make trade fairer for the US, and repeatedly blamed China's trading practices for making American manufacturers less competitive. US-China trade war in 300 words The impact of tariffs on two US firms The US imposed tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including consumer and industrial items such as handbags and rice. China responded in kind, and both sides - the world's two largest economies - ended up imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. This video can not be played Has Trump kept his promises? The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Tariffs ended up raising costs for American companies. Analysts say this is one of a number of factors that have put pressure on markets in recent weeks. In early December, Mr Xi and Mr Trump met after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires for the first time since their trade war started. Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January, and the US said China would buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products. What Trump and Xi's temporary truce means The details of that deal are yet to be ironed out, however. Negotiators from both countries have been in touch over recent weeks and face-to-face talks could take place in January.

Bangladesh opposition demand new election,"This video can not be played There were violent scenes outside polling stations Bangladesh's opposition has condemned what it has called a ""farcical"" election and demanded a new vote. PM Sheikh Hasina is heading for a fourth term with a huge majority that continues to grow as results come in. But there have been claims of vote-rigging, and a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre before polls opened. ""We urge the election commission to void this farcical result immediately,"" opposition leader Kamal Hossain said. ""We are demanding that a fresh election is held under a neutral government as early as possible."" Bangladesh grows tired of its battling leading ladies More on life in Bangladesh The Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters news agency that it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009, but one of the leading opposition parties has accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. A spokesman for the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) alleged there were ""irregularities"" in 221 of the 300 seats being contested. Soon before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second-largest city of the country. Voters queue in the capital, Dhaka At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. Activists, observers and the opposition party had warned that the vote would not be fair, but the governing party accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations. On the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka As we went from polling booth to polling booth, one pattern became clear. People who were supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's party were vocal, and happy to answer our questions on camera, about what issues they'd voted on. The others were mostly too scared to speak out. One man told us that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified It wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed. No-one from the opposition parties was visible. While the election commission has said it will investigate claims of vote-rigging, the organisation has itself been accused of bias by the opposition. So far, the prime minister has not responded to these latest allegations but two days ago rejected claims the election was unfair. It is widely anticipated that her party will win the polls, but it will be a controversial victory. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Sheikh Hasina's long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, did not stand in the election. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

Excitement ahead of distant Nasa flybyHistory will be made on Tuesday when the New Horizons probe sweeps past a far-off icy world.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule. The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements. At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body. The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT. It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data. Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday. Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby ""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence. ""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away."" Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out. ""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters. The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima. With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components. New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment. Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth. But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home. The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second. This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images. Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima. ""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing."" Children invited to mission control celebrate the moment of closest approach When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface. Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May. The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images. ""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in."" Allow Twitter content?

Deadly clashes hit Bangladesh poll,"Voters wait to cast their ballots in Dhaka - elsewhere turnout was reported to be thin At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition as Bangladesh holds a general election. Polls have closed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the overwhelming favourite to win a third term. But the Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. Ms Hasina's main rival is serving a jail term for corruption. Bangladesh grows tired of the Battling Begums The build-up to the poll was marred by violence and accusations of a crackdown against the opposition. Some 600,000 security personnel were deployed to prevent clashes. The authorities ordered high-speed internet be shut down until after the vote to prevent the spread of ""rumours"" that might spark unrest. Minutes before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second largest city of the country. At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. More than 100 million people were eligible to vote but reports suggest turnout has been low. The governing Awami League (AL) said that, despite sporadic incidents, voting was held in a festive atmosphere. The BBC's South Asia regional editor, Anbarasan Ethirajan, says that if the opposition claim of widespread vote rigging is proven, it could question the legitimacy of the new government.

Morocco tourist murders: Swiss man held,"Moroccans have held vigils for the two murdered Scandinavian women A dual Swiss-Spanish national has been arrested in Morocco for alleged involvement in the killings of two Scandinavian tourists. The man, who has not been named, was detained in Marrakesh for allegedly trying to recruit Moroccans ""to carry out terrorist plots"", a statement said. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were murdered in December. Their bodies were found in the High Atlas mountains near a tourist spot. Norwegian police have saida video appearing to show one of the tourists being beheaded was likely to be real. Tourist murders suspects 'backed IS' Morocco's Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said on Saturday the Swiss-Spanish national was suspected of ""teaching some of those arrested... about communication tools involving new technology and of training them in marksmanship"". The Swiss-Spanish national followed an ""extremist ideology"", the statement said. Police said four main suspects in the killings had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, although investigators believe there was no contact with groups in Syria or Iraq. Hundreds across Morocco have attended vigils for the two women. Many participants came with signs saying ""sorry"" In the capital Rabat a minute's silence was held with Danish and Norwegian diplomats present, while hundreds more people attended a vigil in the southern village of Imlil, near where the women's bodies were found. Flowers were also laid in the city of Marrakesh. Ms Jespersen, who was 24 and from Denmark, and 28-year-old Norwegian Ms Ueland had been studying outdoor activities at the University of Southeastern Norway. They had arrived on a month-long holiday in Morocco on 9 December and had travelled to the foothills of Mount Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak, 10km (6 miles) from Imlil. Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found dead in a popular tourist area Their bodies were found in their tent.

"Huge bald eagle lands on US football fansA bird named Clark goes rogue in front of 90,000 fans at a college game.US & Canada","This video can not be played Tuyen Nguyen stuck out his arm as a berth for Clark The eagle has landed - not once, but twice. Two American football fans got the surprise of their lives on Saturday when a North American bald eagle went rogue at a college football game in Texas, and decided to perch in the crowd. The sizeable bird, which goes by the name of Clark, was apparently meant to fly around the stadium during the national anthem, before a 90,000-strong crowd watched the Cotton Bowl, the college football playoff semi-final between Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Clemson Tigers. But instead of landing near his handler, he made straight for Notre Dame fan Albert Armas. Mr Armas, 42, later admitted he was scared when the huge bird took hold of his shoulder. His 13-year-old son Jaysen, who got tickets to the game for Christmas, spent 20 joyful seconds chuckling at his dad's expense. Notre Dame fan Albert Armas was seen flinching as his unexpected visitor spread his wings Pictures and footage from the AT&T Stadium in Arlington show fellow fans cheering and whipping out their phones to capture the unusual moment. Clark wasn't content with visiting one spectator, however - and a second Notre Dame fan, Tuyen Nguyen, was delighted to lend an arm. WATCH: A fruity guide to American football Is college football to blame for NFL woes? He told Sports Illustrated: ""When I saw the bird land [on Armas], I thought the bird had to be very tired. So I put my hand out to see what happens. And it landed on me. It was very interesting. I was very excited. It was amazing, I couldn't even believe it."" Spare a thought for his wife Kim, though - she had gone to the toilet and missed the whole thing.

Kim Jong-un letter asks for more summits,"The two leaders met three times in 2018, twice at the border and once in Pyongyang North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to ""frequently"" meet South Korea's President Moon Jae-in next year to discuss denuclearisation. In a rare letter to Seoul, Mr Kim said he wished to pursue peace between the countries and ""solve the issue of denuclearising the peninsula together"", a spokesman for Mr Moon said. Mr Kim also expressed ""much regret"" that he could not visit Seoul in 2018. He promised to make the trip after Mr Moon visited Pyongyang in September. On his visit to North Korea's capital, Mr Moon gave a speech at the Mass Games, saying the two countries should ""become one"" again. Although both countries technically remain at war, relations improved markedly in 2018 thanks to a number of conciliatory gestures from Mr Kim.

People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit',"This video can not be played Footage shows people smuggling plans over Channel crossing People smugglers are telling migrants that they must enter the UK before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit, a BBC South East investigation found. More than 100 people, the majorityclaiming to be Iranian, have entered British waters in boats this month. An undercover reporter found smuggling operations were being organised at makeshift camps in northern France. Authorities said they wanted to stop a repeat of the Mediterranean crisis in which2,000 migrants drowned this year,external. ""When [the] UK is out of Europe, the borders will be shut properly,"" a smuggler told an undercover reporter posing as an Iranian migrant at a camp in Dunkirk. ""This jungle will be cleared. They will put everyone in jail."" An Afghan, who gave his name as Farhad, told the BBC that he was part of a failed attempt to enter the UK on board a dinghy with 11 others. ""There is a rush,"" he said. ""Everyone is talking about it saying we need to get in quick in case the security gets tighter."" Fahrad, an Afghani migrant, said ""we need to get in quick"" The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on29 March 2019. A smuggler, who said he had been a fisherman in Iran, was filmed by a hidden camera planning a crossing. ""A boat, it'll cost you Â£3,000 to Â£4,000,"" he said. ""I am taking three people with me, they pay in cash. We get a boat and off we go."" British and French authorities have said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? Toddler among nine rescued from dinghy Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Migrants told the BBC they had paid Â£6,000 each for their place on a dinghy. They were told that crossing the Channel would be like playing a computer game. ""This part of the journey is like defeating the last monster, it is hard, very hard,"" the undercover reporter was told. Migrants were rescued from a dinghy in French waters on 25 November Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing through the world's busiest shipping lane - a journey thatpolice have likenedto trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Not all boats that depart succeed in reaching the UK, and at least 30 migrants have been intercepted in French waters since 23 November. Pierre Henri Dumont, a Les RÃ©publicains politician in Calais, said migrants were ""risking their lives every night here in Calais"". ""We need to face the truth,"" he said ""The truth is, we cannot stop everyone."" The Home Office said that Immigration Enforcement and Border Force were ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"".

Man who used football to save Jews diesGeorges Loinger's inventiveness saved hundreds of children during World War Two.Europe,"Loinger received France's top award, the Legion d'Honneur, in 2005 French resistance fighter Georges Loinger, whose bravery and invention saved hundreds of Jewish children in World War Two, has died aged 108. His death was announced by France's Holocaust Memorial Foundation.,external Born in Strasbourg to a Jewish family, he was captured by the Nazis in 1940 but escaped. One of the methods he used to save children was to take them to the Swiss border, then kick a football over the frontier and get them to chase it. ""I spotted a football pitch that was on the border. It was made up of fences two-and-a-half metres high. I saw that there was nobody,"" he said. ""I made the children play, I told some of them to lift up the fences and I passed the ball."" Parents who saved their only child by giving her away The Holocaust year by year Loinger was serving in the French army when he was caught in 1940 but his blond hair and blue eyes apparently concealed the fact he was Jewish from his German captors and this enabled his escape from a prisoner of war camp. Returning to France during the war he joined an aid agency trying to help Jewish children whose parents had been killed or sent to concentration camps. Another method he used involved dressing children as mourners and taking them to a cemetery on the French-Swiss border, where they would climb up a gravedigger's ladder to neutral territory. He is thought to have saved more than 350 children.

Ms Davies wants employers to give staff more time off to look after lonely relatives - in a similar way to how reservists get time away to serve with the Armed Forces.

Call to rid bacon and ham of nitrites,"Leading scientists and a cross-party group of politicians are calling for chemicals called nitrites to be removed from processed meats like bacon. Cancer specialists and politicians are among those backing the campaign to take out nitrites. They say nitrite-free alternatives are safer and should be more widely used. The British Meat Processors Association said nitrites are used in curing meats to help preserve them and add flavour and they are authorised additives. They saidthe European Food Safety Authority found,externalconsumer exposure to nitrites and nitrates as food additives was within safe levels for all population groups, except for a slight exceedance in children whose diet is high in foods containing the chemicals. Should there be a tax on red meat? How much of a cancer risk are processed meats? MPs and doctors said there was a ""consensus of scientific opinion"" that, when cooked and eaten, nitrites produce nitrosamines - chemicals which can cause cancer. They said producers of Parma ham had not used nitrites for 25 years and more recently Nestle in France and Finnebrogue in the UK had produced mass-market products such as bacon and ham that did not use chemical additives. They point to a 2015 World Health Organization reportthat said chemicals involved in processing could increase the risk of colorectal canceras well as research from Glasgow Universitythat suggested eating processed meat could increase the chance of developing breast cancer,external. They also called on the government to launch a public awareness campaign, similar to the war on sugar and fattening foods, to raise awareness of the risks of nitrites. The coalition is led by Professor Chris Elliott, the food scientist who ran the government's investigation into the horse meat scandal, and Dr Aseem Malhotra, a leading NHS cardiologist. Dr Malhotra said the meat industry ""must act fast, (and) act now"". But a spokesman for the British Meat Processors Association said nitrites helped to hinder microbial growth and protect against botulism, a serious form of food poisoning. ""The industry is constantly looking at the levels of nitrites and nitrates, but reductions have to be balanced against the food safety issues and minimising waste,"" he said. Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is ""processed"" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces.

Deadly clashes as Bangladesh votes,"Voters wait to cast their ballots in Dhaka - elsewhere turnout was reported to be thin At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition as Bangladesh holds a general election. Polls have closed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the overwhelming favourite to win a third term. But the Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. Ms Hasina's main rival is serving a jail term for corruption. Bangladesh grows tired of the Battling Begums The build-up to the poll was marred by violence and accusations of a crackdown against the opposition. Some 600,000 security personnel were deployed to prevent clashes. The authorities ordered high-speed internet be shut down until after the vote to prevent the spread of ""rumours"" that might spark unrest. Minutes before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second largest city of the country. At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. More than 100 million people were eligible to vote but reports suggest turnout has been low. The governing Awami League (AL) said that, despite sporadic incidents, voting was held in a festive atmosphere. The BBC's South Asia regional editor, Anbarasan Ethirajan, says that if the opposition claim of widespread vote rigging is proven, it could question the legitimacy of the new government. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Activists, observers and the opposition party warned that the vote would not be fair. The governing party has accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations, on the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka As we went from polling booth to polling booth, one pattern became clear. People who were supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's party were vocal, and happy to answer our questions on camera, about what issues they'd voted on. The others were mostly too scared to speak out. One man told us that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified It wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed. No-one from the opposition parties was visible. While the election commission has said it will investigate claims of vote-rigging, the organisation has itself been accused of bias by the opposition. So far, the prime minister has not responded to these latest allegations but two days ago rejected claims the election was unfair. It is widely anticipated that her party will win the polls, but it will be a controversial victory. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009. Her long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. Security was boosted for the poll amid fears of unrest In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, is not standing in the election, raising questions as to who would take power should the opposition win. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

Italy passes budget after EU standoff,"PM Giuseppe Conte said the budget was ""the first stage of a broad and ambitious plan of reform"" Italy's parliament has approved a revised budget for 2019, amid opposition complaints that it was dictated by the EU. The country's populist government had originally vowed to push through costly campaign promises including a universal basic income. But in October, the European Commission raised concerns about the impact of such spending on Italy's debt levels. Rome was told to revise its budget, or face fines and disciplinary action. Under a deal struck with the Commission last week, Italy lowered its planned budget deficitfrom 2.4% of GDP to 2.04% - less of a reduction than European officials had hoped for. Democratic Party deputies accused the government of increasing taxes and cutting pensions The value of its concessions is understood to be a little more than â¬10bn (Â£9bn). The Senate approved the budget last week, and the lower house of parliament passed the revised proposals in a confidence vote on Saturday, with 327 votes in favour, 228 against, and one abstention. What's behind Italy's economic turbulence? Opposition lawmakers have complained that the last-minute deal with Brussels left parliament unable to debate the altered proposals. The centre-left Democratic Party has filed a complaint with Italy's Constitutional Court, and its supporters held a protest outside parliament. The deadline for passing the budget was 31 December, after which the government would have been forced to continue with the 2018 budget on a monthly basis. Italy's coalition government, made up of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League, has pledged the following: A new income support scheme known as the ""citizens' wage"" will pay â¬780 ($890; Â£700) a month to 1.7 million of Italy's poorest families. The measure is forecast to cost â¬7.1bn. The retirement age will be cut from the current 67 to 62, for workers who have paid into the pension system for 38 years. More than a million self-employed workers earning under â¬65,000 a year will see their taxes cut to 15%. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has hailed the budget as ""the first step of a broad and ambitious plan of reform"" which he said would ""turn Italy inside out like a sock"" and kick-start economic growth. Critics argue that the plan does not create investment incentives, however. The European Commission has said it will watch closely to ensure the budget agreement is adhered to. The threat of disciplinary action remains if it is not. Italy strikes budget deal with EU Italy vows to stick to budget plan What's behind Italy's economic turbulence?

Javid returns to UK amid migrants row,"The UK and France are to step up joint patrols and increase surveillance to tackle a rise in the number of migrants trying to reach Britain in small boats. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who has cut short a family holiday, agreed a joint action plan with the French interior minister during a phone call. Six more Iranian men were found on a beach near Dover on Sunday morning. The National Crime Agency said French authorities prevented a further attempt to cross the Channel on Saturday night. Mr Javid has come under growing pressure to act, with Labour accusing the Home Office of a ""flawed"" strategy and one Conservative MP urging Mr Javid to ""get a grip"". Following a call with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, the Home Office said the pair agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" to be put in place in the coming week. It includes disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The Home Office did not give details of how this would be done. Currently, only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. The Home Office did not say whether the other four cutters would now be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol waters off England's south coast. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' Since November, more than 220 people have attempted to cross the Channel in small boats. They include six men, all Iranian nationals, who were found on a beach at Kingsdown, near Deal, in Kent, on Sunday morning. They have been transferred to immigration officials. Compared to the number of refugees seeking asylum in the UK every year, the number who have attempted to cross the channel by dinghy is tiny, says BBC political correspondent Ben Wright. In 2017, 26,350 people applied for asylum, an average of about 2,200 a month. Six men were found on Kingsdown beach on Sunday The group was found alongside a rigid-hulled inflatable boat Mr Javid was expected to be back in the UK in time to chair a meeting on Monday with senior government officials, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency. On Twitter, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner confirmedhe had spoken by phone to Mr Javid,external, and that they were working together ""to combat Channel crossings"". In atweet,external, Mr Javid thanked him for the ""partnership"", saying the UK and France would ""build on our joint efforts to deter illegal immigration - protecting our borders and human life"". The two are expected to meet face-to-face in January to assess whether further action is required. Many of the migrants are thought to be Iranian or Syrian. A BBC South East investigation last month found that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. One man from Afghanistan told the BBC that there was ""a rush"" and ""everyone is talking about it, saying we need to get in quick in case the security gets tighter"". Watch the BBC South East investigation footage One refugee group said they believed most of those trying to cross wereKurdish peoplefrom Iran. Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said they could have genuine asylum claims and should not have to ""risk their lives"". She said the government needed to find a way to process their claims in France instead - and then transfer them. This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 She said it was ""a miracle"" that there had been no fatalities, as although the weather had been settled, the boats used to transport migrants were ""entirely unsuitable"" and the water was extremely cold. ""I've seen pictures of people with no lifejackets on - it's terrifying,"" she said. ""I hope the government can find the political will to make sure we don't have people drowning off the coast of the UK."" Ms Chapman thought more people were using boats as security had been tightened around Calais, making it more difficult for people to use lorries on ferries or trains. The mild weather may also have encouraged more to try the sea route, she said. Chris Hogben, from the National Crime Agency, said it was new to see this level of Iranian migration and these groups would be paying serious organised criminals ""quite a bit of money"" to get across. He said his officers were also seeing more migrants organise the crossing themselves, either by buying or stealing a boat, and he expected to see more attempts using that method in the coming weeks. Some MPs have called for more vessels to be deployed in the Channel, but Mr Javid said it was ""vital we strike a balance between protecting [migrants] and protecting our borders"". The home secretary said he wanted to avoid encouraging more people to take the risk of attempting the crossing and was keeping the number of cutters ""under close review"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn said in a tweet,external: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said the Home Office's strategy was ""flawed"", with the ""focus on deterring refugees, thinking that the issues in the Mediterranean would never reach our shores"". Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said he wanted to work with France to find the safe houses where people were being trafficked to, as well as identify where the traffickers are getting their boats from and stop them setting off for England. ""If we don't act and stop it now, sooner or later there's a great risk of a tragedy in the middle of the English Channel,"" he said.

Obituary: June Whitfield,"Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy. Often playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself ""a comic's tart"". But after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right. The actress always said she was ""very bad at getting round to things"". But from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV. June Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925. Her father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing. By the mid 1950s she was one of radio's biggest stars Trained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944. She was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections. When she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home. Later she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman. However, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor. Whitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy. Stars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her. She was always the versatile sidekick She called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing. ""The greatest of show business mysteries,"" Denis Norden once said, ""was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield."" With Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC. Her most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here. For seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting ""Ooh, Ron"", addressed to her hapless fiance. And for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy. Her first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966. Terry and June: a gentle style of comedy She went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June. The chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life. Described as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run. Whitfield described herself as living ""in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that"". She also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: ""It can make a dishonest woman of you."" Her big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure ""The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,"" she said.  ""Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing."" She played serious roles, here as Aunt Drusilla in Jude In 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous. Originally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters. ""As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,"" she commented. As the new century dawned, Whitfield continued a wide variety of roles including parts in Midsomer Murders and that retirement home for actors of a certain generation, Last of the Summer Wine. In 2009 she appeared in The End of Time, the Doctor Who episode that was the last for David Tennant. She was awarded an OBE in 1985 and CBE in 1998 and, in 2017, became a Dame. Despite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, explaining that she lacked the drive and confidence. She won a new generation of fans as the dotty mother in Absolutely Fabulous And as the on-stage muse to stars like Hancock and Cooper, she was all too aware of the personal cost. When they died prematurely, she attributed this to ""the responsibility, the stress and strain"" of carrying the show. Instead, June Whitfield revelled in her role of versatile sidekick for three generations of audiences. She enjoyed enduring popularity and success, a life she described in her autobiography as ""full of love, affection and laughter, of gigs, gags and a couple of gongs"".

"Foreign Office reveals most bizarre callsConsular staff were asked about vampires in Poland, vegetarian sausages and the Strictly results.UK","One caller said a stray cat had peed on his bed Questions about vampires in Poland and vegetarian sausages are among the most bizarre phone calls made to consular staff, the Foreign Office has said. It has compiled the strangest calls from Britons abroad in 2018 in a bid to remind people its helpline is meant to be used in an emergency. It received more than 330,000 calls from people asking for help. One person in the Netherlands had just watched the film Braveheart and called to ask questions about the plot. Someone in the Canary Islands requested the Foreign Office persuade his hotel to give him a different room after a stray cat had ""broken into"" his current one and peed on his bed. One person called to ask about Strictly Come Dancing results Another caller in the US phoned up to ask which contestant had been voted off Strictly Come Dancing the previous night. In 2018, consular staff have dealt with more than 3,400 people who were taken to hospital and 4,900 who were arrested overseas. The FCO also issued more than 29,600 emergency travel documents. But some of the other odder queries to the Foreign Office included: A man checking whether there were vampires in Poland because a woman he met online had asked what blood type he was before they met for their first date Another man requesting the Foreign Office speak to a massage parlour in Bangkok on his behalf, as he fell asleep during a massage and felt he shouldn't have to pay for it A caller in New Delhi asking what time the British High Commission opened, as he'd heard it sold vegetarian sausages and he wanted to buy some A person in Italy asking the embassy to help arrange their wedding, recommend a florist, and get them tickets to see the Pope A man in Kuwait asking if any Foreign Office staff wanted to adopt his puppies A caller asking for a list of women in Argentina whom he might be able to marry A man asking where he should send a 5ft piece of wood that he had found on a beach that he thought may be from a British warship from the 1700s. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""I can regretfully confirm that the Foreign Office isn't able to offer advice on vampires, rogue stray cats or Strictly contestants. ""And our capacity to deploy veggie sausages remains sadly lacking."" ""If you find yourself in an emergency in another country, contact the nearest British embassy, High Commission or consulate and our consular staff will do everything they can to help.""

Call to rid bacon and ham from nitritesA group of leading scientists and politicians wants processing to happen without the chemicals.UK,"Leading scientists and a cross-party group of politicians are calling for chemicals called nitrites to be removed from processed meats like bacon. Cancer specialists and politicians are among those backing the campaign to take out nitrites. They say nitrite-free alternatives are safer and should be more widely used. The British Meat Processors Association said nitrites are used in curing meats to help preserve them and add flavour and they are authorised additives. They saidthe European Food Safety Authority found,externalconsumer exposure to nitrites and nitrates as food additives was within safe levels for all population groups, except for a slight exceedance in children whose diet is high in foods containing the chemicals. Should there be a tax on red meat? How much of a cancer risk are processed meats? MPs and doctors said there was a ""consensus of scientific opinion"" that, when cooked and eaten, nitrites produce nitrosamines - chemicals which can cause cancer. They said producers of Parma ham had not used nitrites for 25 years and more recently Nestle in France and Finnebrogue in the UK had produced mass-market products such as bacon and ham that did not use chemical additives. They point to a 2015 World Health Organization reportthat said chemicals involved in processing could increase the risk of colorectal canceras well as research from Glasgow Universitythat suggested eating processed meat could increase the chance of developing breast cancer,external. They also called on the government to launch a public awareness campaign, similar to the war on sugar and fattening foods, to raise awareness of the risks of nitrites. The coalition is led by Professor Chris Elliott, the food scientist who ran the government's investigation into the horse meat scandal, and Dr Aseem Malhotra, a leading NHS cardiologist. Dr Malhotra said the meat industry ""must act fast, (and) act now"". But a spokesman for the British Meat Processors Association said nitrites helped to hinder microbial growth and protect against botulism, a serious form of food poisoning. ""The industry is constantly looking at the levels of nitrites and nitrates, but reductions have to be balanced against the food safety issues and minimising waste,"" he said. Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is ""processed"" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. Processed meats do cause cancer - WHO Should there be a tax on red meat?

Brazil looks to loosen gun lawsIncoming President Jair Bolsonaro says he plans to sign a decree to allow more people to own guns.Latin America & Caribbean,"Practice at a Rio de Janeiro gun club: shares in one manufacturer have recently jumped Brazil's incoming far-right president has said he will seek to issue a decree loosening the country's gun laws. Jair Bolsonaro, who takes over on 1 January, had made the pledge a key part of his presidential campaign. Brazil currently has strict gun ownership laws, requiring any prospective owners to undergo psychological tests. But Mr Bolsonaro has said more guns would allow ""good people"" in Brazil help combat violent crime. In response to Brazil having one of the world's highest murder rates, the Senate passed the Disarmament Statute in 2003. Under the statute, which stands to this day: only strictly defined groups of people, including police and security officials are able to obtain a gun licence anyone using a gun without a licence could face four years in jail proof of residence, employment, technical and psychological capacity are needed to get a licence. In the first year after the statue was introduced, the murder rate in Brazil dropped by 8%. In the same time, about 500,000 guns were seized by police under a buy-back scheme. Since that drop, murder rates have started to climb again. According to the World Bank, Brazil has the eighth highest murder rate in the world, behind countries such as El Salvador and Jamaica. The Brazilian Public Security Forum, which collects and analyses crime data from state and federal government,there were 63,880 homicides in Brazil last year,external(equivalent to 175 a day) - an increase of2.9%on the previous year. A number of factors have been identified, including Brazil's role as a hub in the international cocaine trade, and dwindling police resources. Why are there so many murders in Brazil? Impoverished parts of north-east Brazil in particular has seen a large increase in recent years. Over the past decade the murder rate in Rio Grande do Norte state has soared by more than250%, according to the government-affiliated IPEA research body. Between 2016 and 2017, there was also a significant jump in the number of people killed by police in Brazil -up 20% to 5,144. Security became one of the key themes of the presidential campaign, which Mr Bolsonaro won in October with 55.2% of the vote. This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro will be Brazil's new president. But who is he? During his campaign, he would often make the case for more people owning guns, adding that gangs had continued to obtain guns despite strict legislation. ""Every honest citizen, man or woman, if they want to have a weapon in their homes - depending on certain criteria - should be able to have one,"" he said. Mr Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper, is an avid supporter of America's National Rifle Association, and the door of his campaign office was emblazoned with the slogan: ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."" Reuters reports that shares in Brazilian gun maker Taurus Armas SA climbed by about 88% year-on-year amid expectation gun rights would be relaxed. In his tweet on Saturday announcing the decree,external, Mr Bolsonaro said those with criminal records would continue to be prevented from owning guns. A poll last August found that 58% of Brazilians believed that restrictions should continue on gun ownership. But any decree Mr Bolsonaro puts before Congress is likely to pass with a majority.

Bangladesh heads to polls amid high alert,"Voters wait to cast their ballots in Dhaka - elsewhere turnout was reported to be thin At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition as Bangladesh holds a general election. Polls have closed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the overwhelming favourite to win a third term. But the Bangladesh Election Commission told Reuters it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate. Ms Hasina's main rival is serving a jail term for corruption. Bangladesh grows tired of the Battling Begums The build-up to the poll was marred by violence and accusations of a crackdown against the opposition. Some 600,000 security personnel were deployed to prevent clashes. The authorities ordered high-speed internet be shut down until after the vote to prevent the spread of ""rumours"" that might spark unrest. Minutes before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second largest city of the country. At least 28 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. More than 100 million people were eligible to vote but reports suggest turnout has been low. The governing Awami League (AL) said that, despite sporadic incidents, voting was held in a festive atmosphere. The BBC's South Asia regional editor, Anbarasan Ethirajan, says that if the opposition claim of widespread vote rigging is proven, it could question the legitimacy of the new government. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Activists, observers and the opposition party warned that the vote would not be fair. The governing party has accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations, on the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka As we went from polling booth to polling booth, one pattern became clear. People who were supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's party were vocal, and happy to answer our questions on camera, about what issues they'd voted on. The others were mostly too scared to speak out. One man told us that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified It wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed. No-one from the opposition parties was visible. While the election commission has said it will investigate claims of vote-rigging, the organisation has itself been accused of bias by the opposition. So far, the prime minister has not responded to these latest allegations but two days ago rejected claims the election was unfair. It is widely anticipated that her party will win the polls, but it will be a controversial victory. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009. Her long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. Security was boosted for the poll amid fears of unrest In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, is not standing in the election, raising questions as to who would take power should the opposition win. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

Fox: Brexit is 50-50 if May's deal rejected,"Senior Brexiteer minister Liam Fox says there is a 50-50 chance the UK will not leave the EU on 29 March if MPs reject Theresa May's Brexit deal next month. The international trade secretarytold the Sunday Times,externalit would only be ""100% certain"" if MPs back the deal. He said if the deal is rejected, that ""would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament"". MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in January, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March. The agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force with a majority backing in Parliament. The Commons vote was due to be held on 11 December but the PM postponed it once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn this week urged Mrs May to cut short MPs' Christmas break - they are due back in the Commons on 7 January - toallow for an earlier vote. Brexit: A really simple guide Recall MPs for Brexit vote, Corbyn urges Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit Mr Fox has warned fellow MPs that failure to pass the deal would be ""incendiary"" and said it was ""a matter of honour"" for them to support the PM. He said: ""What you can be sure of is that if we vote for the prime minister's deal then it's 100% certain that we will leave on 29 March. ""If we do not vote for that, I'm not sure I would give it much more than 50-50. ""And, for me, that would induce a sense that we had betrayed the people that had voted in the referendum."" Please upgrade your browser Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""The only thing that is shattering the bond of trust between electorate and Parliament is the refusal of ministers like Liam Fox to trust people with the final say on Brexit."" If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has urged the UK to ""get your act together and then tell us what it is you want"" for Brexit. Speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, he said it was ""unreasonable"" for parts of the British public to expect Brussels to solve ""British problems"". Mr Juncker also rejected the idea that the EU wanted to keep the UK in the EU ""by all possible means"" and suggested the majority of MPs ""deeply distrust"" the EU and Theresa May.

Mims Davies said British people could learn from how Mediterranean nations involve grandparents in their lives.

A 2017 report said loneliness was asharmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Ms Davies, who was appointedfollowing the resignation of Tracey Crouchin November, said: ""Very often you will be out on holiday - a few of you in a small British family - and you will find this huge, wonderful plethora of people on the beach. ""And you will think, 'God, doesn't that look fun?' ""We are just a little bit blinkered. We have decided that we should box ourselves in a bit. ""I think when we are a little bit more bold about how we do things, we find so much more joy in it."" Loneliness threatens young as well as old 'I'm surrounded by people - but I feel so lonely' Tackling loneliness - some ideas Ms Davies, a former carer, said that being present for the final part of her parents' lives was something she would ""never regret"". She added: ""We are in a weird place when we are very willing to drag our children around into our lives and enjoy our lives with them together - but being that sort of extended family is seen as being a bit more difficult."" Ms Davies wants employers to give staff more time off to look after lonely relatives - in a similar way to how reservists get time away to serve with the Armed Forces.

Bangladesh tires of Battling Begums,"Khaleda Zia is expected to appeal after being convicted this week Move over Machiavelli, step aside Sun Tzu. If you want to know how to defeat your enemies and hold on to power the real playbook should be Bangladeshi politics. The conviction of the leader of the Bangladeshi opposition, Khaleda Zia, is just the latest gambit in a decades-long battle between the country's two formidable leading ladies. In Bangladesh they call them the Battling Begums - where ""begum"" refers to a Muslim woman of high rank. But there is nothing ladylike about their conflict. The vicious enmity between the current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and her great rival, Khaleda Zia, has dragged the country into a spiral of violence with bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming sickeningly regular occurrences. It wasn't always like this. They actually worked together in the 1980s to oust General Ershad, a military dictator, and restore democracy to Bangladesh. Both women are political royalty, scions of leading figures in the independence movement that saw Bangladesh created out of what was then East Pakistan in 1971 after a bitter war. Tragedy prompted both to enter politics. Thousands of Khaleda Zia's supporters have taken to the streets Sheikh Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is celebrated as the founding father of independent Bangladesh.  He was the nation's first president, but was assassinated in 1975. Khaleda Zia's husband, Ziaur Rahman, was another independence hero - a key military commander.  He founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the late 1970s and became president in 1977, before he too was assassinated, in 1981. But, having combined their forces to defeat Ershad, they turned on each other, and power has pretty much shuttled between them since the early 1990s. At the moment Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League party are very much on top, having audaciously outmanoeuvred her rival and ruthlessly entrenched her power. She won the last general election, back in January 2014, even before the polls opened. It wasn't because her supporters had been stuffing ballot boxes:the BNP decided to boycott the vote. One of the reasons was to protest against the charges of misusing orphanage funds which saw Khaleda Zia jailed this week. Sheikh Hasina is at the moment dominating the battle As a result Sheikh Hasina's Awami League candidates were uncontested in 153 of the 300 parliamentary seats - a clear majority. ""Didn't other candidates decide to stand when the main opposition pulled out?"" I asked one grizzled observer of Bangladeshi politics. He sighed heavily. ""Of course they did. They just chose to withdraw, or maybe they were 'persuaded' to do so,"" he suggested with a wry smile. Bangladeshi politics is marked by a lot of what he characterises as ""persuasion"". Since winning the last election, Sheikh Hasina has hounded the BNP's leaders and banned its coalition partner, Jamaat-e-Islami. And the five-year sentence handed down by the court this week could see Khaleda Zia excluded from another general election, due in December, thereby potentially handing Sheikh Hasina a fourth consecutive victory. That's because under Bangladeshi law anyone imprisoned for more than two years cannot run for office. Ms Zia is expected to appeal the conviction and, so long as that is pending, she should be able to stand. ""Nobody will be allowed to score a goal this time on a playground void of opposition,"" she told party activists the day before sentencing. Security forces have cracked down hard on protesters But she knows there's a teetering tower of more than 30 other criminal charges pending against her. Ms Zia has been accused of everything from corruption to sedition. Her supporters insist this is all part of Sheikh Hasina's attempts to undermine her and her party.  They say hundreds of BNP activists were arrested and detained in the run up to the verdict. Last week the international campaigning group, Human Rights Watch (HRW), called on Sheikh Hasina to stop all such arbitrary arrests and detentions. It accused the government of ""violating the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly,"" by preventing opposition supports from demonstrating. Bangladeshi security forces used tear gas and batons to control thousands of Ms Zia's supporters who took to the streets following the verdict. Brad Adams, the Asia director at HRW, called for restraint. ""The Bangladesh government's claims to be open and democratic ring hollow as it cracks down on political debate,"" he said. But the truth is many Bangladeshis have grown tired of the begums and their endless battles. Try and start a conversation about politics in a Bangladeshi ""dhaba"" - a street cafÃ© - and you always get the same hushed tones and pained expressions. Bangladeshis seem exhausted and disillusioned by the personal animus that fuels so much of what happens in politics here. That doesn't stop the two women at the heart of Bangladeshi politics, though. Both are now in their 70s, but neither is ready to throw in the towel. You might imagine this week's verdict would change that. Many commentators believe this marks the final collapse of Bangladesh's two-party system. But Khaleda Zia is having none of it. ""I will be back, there is no need to cry,"" she told her weeping supporters and relatives as she left the court on Thursday.

Is Bangladesh winning war on militants?,"Bangladesh has mounted a series of high-profile raids on Islamist militant hideouts in recent days after the country was stung by a wave of suicide blasts. Many had thought the militants were on the back foot after a security crackdown - so who's got the upper hand? Early last week, army commandos killed four suspects in a prolonged battle in the north-eastern town of Sylhet. Days later seven to eight people were found blown up as police closed in on them in neighbouring Moulvibazar. The bloodshed came afterthree botched suicide bombings in as many days in and around Dhaka,external. Suicide bombings are rare in Bangladesh - so the apparent shift in militant tactics is alarming. ""There is no doubt the suicide explosions in Bangladesh pose a serious challenge,"" says Jaideep Saikia, author of books on terrorism in India and Bangladesh. ""This can destabilise the whole region, the eastern part of South Asia,"" he told the BBC. Many have been shocked by the intensity of the recent violence. When police entered the hideout in Moulvibazar district they found a scene of carnage. ""It was a gory sight, unbelievably repelling,"" said Monirul Islam, chief of the Counter-Terrorism Centre and a veteran of operations against militants. ""The militants had blown themselves up along with their wives and children."" The recent suicide blasts began when a woman blew herself up on 24 December to avoid capture during a raid in Dhaka, police said. Then came the three failed attempts in and around Dhaka. Alarmed by the suicide explosions, police mounted a series of ""proactive operations"" across the country. Troops rescued civilians in Sylhet before launching raids on militant hideouts In Sylhet, they were asked to man the outer perimeter and the army conducted the main assault. Dozens of civilians were freed safely. But two policemen and the chief of the Rapid Action Battalion's Intelligence wing died, along with four other civilians, when hit by grenades during the assault. Inside terror attack cafe Sylhet blasts kill six amid militant raid Is violent extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Within hours of the end of the operations in Sylhet, police encircled two hideouts in Moulvibazar and another in the eastern city of Comilla. Going by recent events, the militants are clearly adopting different tactics. In Sylhet, they attacked the outer cordon to cause a tactical diversion when the siege was under way. In Moulvibazar, they blew themselves up to avoid capture - but long before they could inflict casualties on police commandos. In Comilla, they escaped, taking advantage of city elections which had halted police operations. ""They might have given us the slip,"" Police Deputy Inspector General Shafikul Islam admitted later. Opinion is divided on whether the suicide explosions reflect a level of desperation among the Islamist militant groups - or a new level of  bravado. ""The militants are now desperate, they are on the run and our police and security forces will continue to hunt them down,"" said Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. ""The suicide bombings could be an act of sheer desperation,"" he said. The government has consistently rejected claims by so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda that they are behind the violence, usually blaming an offshoot of the banned home-grown Islamist group Jamiatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). But some remain alarmed. ""There is no room for complacency - terrorism has re-emerged with more vigour,"" warns Bangladesh-born analyst Taj Hashmi. And there are persistent worries over the authorities' tactics. The Bangladesh police and the Rapid Action Battalion have often been blamed, even by the UN, for enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and use of torture. Former diplomat Farooq Sobhan argues that Bangladesh's counter-terrorism efforts have been largely successful so far because the operations have been unrelenting and unwavering. ""But I would now pitch for a more inclusive approach, particularly focused on eliminating conditions conducive to radicalisation,"" Mr Sobhan said. The attack on a popular cafe in Dhaka's Gulshan area on 1 July last year led to the massacre of more than 20 hostages, most of them foreigners. Army commandos were called in after two police officers died trying to fight the militants, all of whom were later killed by the army. ""That was our 9/11, a real hard wake-up call,"" says Haroon Habib, secretary of the Sector Commanders' Forum, an organisation of veterans of the 1971 war of independence. Police encountered bloody scenes when they entered a militant hideout in Moulvibazar The cafe attack came after a series of killings of secular bloggers, writers, publishers, cultural activists and politicians since 2013 that led many to believe Bangladesh was losing its war against militants. But the Gulshan attack galvanised the country's security architecture into action. Bangladesh police and paramilitary forces, sometimes supported by the army, went after the Islamist militants with a vengeance. Between July and December, they say at least eight top militant leaders - such as the JMB's Tamim Choudhury, Tanvir Quaderi and retired Major Zahidul Islam - were killed. Many other alleged senior and middle-ranking activists were arrested or killed in a series of co-ordinated assaults. Islamist militancy looked like it might have been curbed. But that is when the suicide attacks began, bringing to Bangladesh the spectre so familiar to the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Foreign Office reveals most bizarre calls,"One caller said a stray cat had peed on his bed Questions about vampires in Poland and vegetarian sausages are among the most bizarre phone calls made to consular staff, the Foreign Office has said. It has compiled the strangest calls from Britons abroad in 2018 in a bid to remind people its helpline is meant to be used in an emergency. It received more than 330,000 calls from people asking for help. One person in the Netherlands had just watched the film Braveheart and called to ask questions about the plot. Someone in the Canary Islands requested the Foreign Office persuade his hotel to give him a different room after a stray cat had ""broken into"" his current one and peed on his bed. One person called to ask about Strictly Come Dancing results Another caller in the US phoned up to ask which contestant had been voted off Strictly Come Dancing the previous night. In 2018, consular staff have dealt with more than 3,400 people who were taken to hospital and 4,900 who were arrested overseas. The FCO also issued more than 29,600 emergency travel documents. But some of the other odder queries to the Foreign Office included: A man checking whether there were vampires in Poland because a woman he met online had asked what blood type he was before they met for their first date Another man requesting the Foreign Office speak to a massage parlour in Bangkok on his behalf, as he fell asleep during a massage and felt he shouldn't have to pay for it A caller in New Delhi asking what time the British High Commission opened, as he'd heard it sold vegetarian sausages and he wanted to buy some A person in Italy asking the embassy to help arrange their wedding, recommend a florist, and get them tickets to see the Pope A man in Kuwait asking if any Foreign Office staff wanted to adopt his puppies A caller asking for a list of women in Argentina whom he might be able to marry A man asking where he should send a 5ft piece of wood that he had found on a beach that he thought may be from a British warship from the 1700s. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""I can regretfully confirm that the Foreign Office isn't able to offer advice on vampires, rogue stray cats or Strictly contestants. ""And our capacity to deploy veggie sausages remains sadly lacking."" ""If you find yourself in an emergency in another country, contact the nearest British embassy, High Commission or consulate and our consular staff will do everything they can to help.""
