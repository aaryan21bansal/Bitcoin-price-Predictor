London Bridge shot might have passed through bus,"This previously unpublished picture shows London Bridge soon after the attacker was shot - with the bus on the right that was hit A ricochet from a police bullet could have passed through the entire top deck of a bus during the London Bridge terror attack, pictures reveal. The police have suggested a ricochet could have hit the bus, stopped near to where attacker Usman Khan was shot. A picture given to BBC News by an eye witness on the bus behind showsa round hole and a shattered back window. But a closer examination of other photos from the bridge reveals a hole in the front window of the bus as well. The front window of the bus also appears to have been hit - with a forensic examination taking place The eye witness, who does not want to be named, believes the bus he was on was also clipped. He was at the front of the upper deck when he saw, heard and felt the impact of the back window of the bus in front shattering, and immediately dived to the floor. ""We are talking about a split-second of noise,"" he said. The picture given to BBC News by a passenger on the bus directly behind shows a round hole and a shattered back window ""In no more than a half-a-second I was on the floor."" It suggests there was more of a fortunate near miss than had previously been recognised - and might explain how the ricocheting bullet had reached the back window. Armed officers shot Khan after he had been tackled by members of the public using improvised weapons including fire extinguishers and a narwhal tusk. Khan had been chased from nearby Fishmongers' Hall, after a knife attack in which he had killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who had been working at a prison rehabilitation event at the hall. The damage to the bus seems to have happened after the initial shots that had stopped Khan, raising questions about further shots that might have been fired. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which is investigating, said that establishing the cause of damage to the bus was ""a line of enquiry for us"". 300 seconds on London Bridge London Bridge attacker attended untested rehabilitation courses Praise for public who stepped in to stop London Bridge attacker Dr Rachel Bolton-King, associate professor of forensic science at Staffordshire University says the specifics of what happened will have to be established by the formal investigation. But she says it might be possible for a ricocheted bullet to ""pass through one window, through the length of the bus and out the window at the opposite end of the bus"". ""Ricochet bullets are often unstable once they have hit their first target surface,"" she said. A close-up shows the hole in the front window of the bus, along with the reflections of nearby buildings They could continue ""nose on"" in the normal direction of flight but could also be deflected sideways or into other angles. And investigators would be able to find the direction of travel by examining the front and back surfaces of the window. Forensic investigators examined the damaged bus Philip Boyce, of forensic services company Forensic Equity, said the bullet could have entered through the front window and glanced off the ceiling of the bus before going out through the back. Ricochets could carry for hundreds of yards, depending on the surfaces they hit but well within the distance between the bus and the site of Khan's shooting, he said. And their path could be altered by what they hit or passed through, such as laminated or toughened glass. Transport for London confirmed that a bus was damaged during the incident - with the Metropolitan police suggesting that it could have been a ricochet from a police bullet.

Johnson and Corbyn make last pitches of campaignThe party leaders talk to the BBC in the final hours before polls open on Thursday morning.,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are competing for the keys to No 10 Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are focusing on Brexit and public services in their final hours of campaigning. In their last interviews with the BBC ahead of Thursday's poll, Mr Johnson repeated his main pledges, saying: ""Only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward."" Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said there was a ""greater understanding"" from the public that the country ""cannot go on with underfunded public services"". The polls will open at 07:00 GMT. Both leaders held their final rallies in London on Wednesday night. Leaders in final push for votes ahead of election WATCH: What's the election been about? Other party leaders also travelled the country on the last day before the election to win support from undecided voters. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said votes for her party could stop Brexit, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for her party was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"". Nigel Farage warned against Mr Johnson's deal to leave the EU, calling for voters in Leave seats to back his Brexit Party. And Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Talking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said he thought the election result would be ""very close"", and that ""every vote counts"". Asked if he deserved to win, he said: ""I do think that we have the best programme for the country, we have an amazing agenda. We want to unite and level up across the country."" Mr Johnson said the Conservatives' plans - including a law to ensure extra funding for the NHS every year and 20,000 new police offices -  were ""fantastically ambitious"". He added: ""We can achieve all of these things. But we can't if our politics is paralysed by Brexit. We have to move it forward."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""The choice is absolutely stark"" Asked about his reaction to the photo of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a hospital due to a lack of beds, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously I think that anybody who experiences a bad time in the NHS has my full, full sympathies. ""We've all been there and anybody who has had a bad experience in A&E will know exactly how that family feels, and that is why I want to concentrate on getting cash into the NHS, taking the country forward."" But he reiterated that ""only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward"". Speaking at his final rally in London, Mr Johnson there was ""24 hours to break the deadlock"". He said the Conservative government would ""make sure we give our children and grandchildren the future they deserve in this country"". Mr Johnson ended by saying: ""Let's get Brexit done and take this incredible country forwards together."" Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Corbyn said he had a ""hunch"" that the polling experts -who have predicted a solid leader for the Conservatives over Labour- ""may just have got it wrong"". ""We have travelled all round the country and the enthusiasm of our party's supporters working together to get out there with our message is incredible - and I think that message is getting through,"" he said. ""I think the support is growing and there is a greater understanding that we cannot go on with underfunded public services and a government that has not been straightforward with us on Brexit or the trade talks with the USA."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We're going to win this thing"" Asked about candidates who have expressed concerns about negative feedback on the doorsteps - including a leaked recording of shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth casting doubts on Labour's chances in the poll - Mr Corbyn said: ""You show me a candidate at any election that isn't worried from any party. ""Being a candidate means you get worried. But I tell you what, we are going to win this thing."" If there is a Labour government on Friday morning, Mr Corbyn said the first thing he would do was ""deal with the worst levels of poverty in Britain"" - namely the homeless - saying: ""Something must be done very quickly, very urgently and that is what we are going to do."" Also holding his final rally in London, Mr Corbyn said the country was ""literally at a fork in the road"". He told supporters there had ""never been a clearer choice"" in British history than at this election, and that his party would redistribute wealth and power ""in a way that's never been seen before"". Mr Corbyn concluded with a poem, saying: ""My guitar is not for the rich. No, nothing like that. My song is of the ladder we are building to reach the stars.""

What does the BBC poll tracker say?,"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election. This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list. If there were a (UK) general election tomorrow to elect MPs to Westminster, would you vote Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Brexit Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru, or for another party? If there were a general election held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?

Leaders in final push for votes,"The UK's party leaders are touring the country on a frenetic final day of campaigning, focusing on key messages ahead of Thursday's general election. Boris Johnson has insisted only the Tories will ""get Brexit done"" and move the country forward while Jeremy Corbyn has vowed Labour will end austerity and give ""hope to the next generation"". Jo Swinson has said a strong Lib Dem showing can stop the UK leaving the EU. Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP in Scotland could stop a Tory victory. With voting set to begin at 07:00 GMT on Thursday, the parties are stressing the scale of the choice facing people and the impact it will have on the direction of the country. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said voters were being offered hugely divergent choices when it came to the UK's relationship with Europe, with the Conservatives promising to leave the European Union next month while Labour and others were backing a further referendum. Election 2019 manifesto guide Who is standing for election in my area? A really simple guide to the election And the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam said both the Tories and Labour were proposing fundamental changes to how the UK's economy and trade have worked over the past 30 years. In terms of the opinion polls, the Conservatives retain a solid lead over Labour,according to the BBC's opinion poll tracker. A poll produced by YouGov released on Tuesday evening suggests the Conservatives are on course for a small majority of around 28 - but the pollster points out that the margin of error means neither another hung Parliament nor a larger Tory majority can be ruled out. Labour is hoping for a late swing in its favour, as happened in the 2017 general election, while the Tories are warning about the possibility of a hung Parliament, amid concerns about voter complacency. Both Conservative and Labour party leaders will be hoping to put a rocky few days behind them, as they embark on the traditional election-eve tour of target seats. The prime minister visited a bakery in Derby on Wednesday Mr Johnson began Wednesday by doing a milk round in West Yorkshire, saying the election campaign ""could not be tighter"" and that there is a ""real risk again of a hung Parliament"". He said: ""The critical risk is very real. We cannot have more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country."" He is using events throughout the day, including a visit to a bakery in Derbyshire, to stress key Tory pledges on investing in the NHS, raising the number of police officers and bringing in a new immigration system. But his main message will be on Brexit, saying ""unless we get out of this quicksand... our future as a country remains uncertain"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today that only a clear Conservative victory would lift the UK out of the ""rut"" it had fallen into over Brexit and enable the country to ""move on"" to dealing with other challenges, like social care and the environment. Mr Corbyn started the day in Scotland, telling a rally in Glasgow that a Labour government would ""eliminate child poverty, give hope to the next generation and invest properly in education all across the UK"". At a rally in Middlesbrough, he repeated pledges on funding for the NHS, expanding free childcare and lowering transport fares, and also addressed Brexit, saying Labour would get it sorted by securing a ""good deal for working people"" and giving the public the ""final say"". Jeremy Corbyn held a rally in Middlesbrough He told activists: ""Remember it is our choice, our chance tomorrow, to elect a government that will be for the many, not the few. A government you can trust. ""And it will not be motivated solely by more billionaires... it will be motivated by improving the life chances of every single child all across this country, and bringing justice."" Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mr Corbyn had a ""real live chance"" of being prime minister by Friday, telling the BBC's Politics Live that while Brexit was a tough issue in many seats, what voters were really concerned about was the future of the NHS, schools and the cost of living. However, a group of 15 former Labour MPs, including several who quit the party over the past year, have urged voters to back other parties, saying Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister due to his record on anti-Semitism and national security. Responding, Mr Corbyn said: ""People who have left the Labour Party and decided to join up with the party that has imposed austerity, poverty and injustice on the poorest people in this country should look themselves in the mirror and decide what they are doing."" Meanwhile, Ms Swinson said the last few hours were ""absolutely critical"" with thousands of voters yet to make up their minds. On a visit to Esher in Surrey, where the Lib Dems hope to oust Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, she said tactical voting could determine the outcome of Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats and Labour voters in such areas could hold the result ""in their hands"". She also visited a volunteer hub in London to thank activists, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward."" Campaigning in Esher, Jo Swinson said her aim was to ""stop Boris and stop Brexit"" Back on the road again today for the leaders' last push. There feels like there's been a real mismatch between the nature and conduct of the campaign and the scale of the choice. It's a huge moment for the country, but we've heard so many times voters saying they don't like ""either of them"". People's thinking is really dominated by the two big characters in the campaign and no-one is making it to No 10 on a surge of anything like enthusiasm. People seem fed up of politicians telling them how divided they are - most people have been quite rightly getting on with their lives while Westminster has torn itself apart. This video can not be played BBC Political editor Laura Kuenssberg sums up the election campaign. The frustration Tories hoped to capitalise on is real, but there are doubts all over the place about whether Boris Johnson is the answer to that. However, beyond his strong core support there seems to be less appetite for Jeremy Corbyn to take it on. There is a massive generational split though. Smaller parties haven't punched through as some predicted, although they will still have a huge impact, and there are a vast number of local factors at play, of course, too. Anyway, enough musing for now. Suffice to say this is an incredibly tight contest in lots of places. In 48 hours we might be waiting in a freezing Downing Street for Mr Johnson to return with a majority, or about to enter a frenzy of hung Parliament talks which could propel Mr Corbyn into power. The SNP is taking a similar tack in its appeal to Labour voters in Scotland, calling on them to back the party to ""lock Boris Johnson out of No 10"". Describing the PM's Get Brexit Done slogan as the ""biggest con"" of the election, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"". Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Scotland's future should lie in its own hands, Nicola Sturgeon said on a visit to a greengrocer's in Edinburgh The Green Party's co-leaders urged people to make this a climate election at a photo call in London Nigel Farage is hoping to get a handful of Brexit Party candidates ""over the line"" Speaking in Doncaster, Nigel Farage said the Brexit Party was challenging Labour in many of its Yorkshire heartlands, and he appealed to Leave supporters to back his candidates in areas where the Conservatives could not win. Plaid Cymru's leader, Adam Price, told the BBC that Wales was the ""forgotten nation"" in the UK and had been ""neglected"" for decades by successive Conservative and Labour governments. He said his party would press whoever formed the next UK government for more resources to tackle child poverty, while also making the case to remain in the EU and ultimately for Wales to govern itself.

10 things you need to know about the campaign,"We've had key messages hammered home, the odd gaffe and rows over TV debates. But what else have we learnt since Boris Johnson called a snap election? We don't have a presidential voting system in the UK, but you wouldn't know it from the campaigns of the two main parties. The choice is between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the Conservatives and Labour have said throughout - with both leaders travelling up and down the country to appeal to voters. We have barely seen some of the front bench - Home Secretary Priti Patel or Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom at main campaign events, for example - and on Labour's side we haven't seen shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer or shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. But, during a sit-down interview with BBC Breakfast, Mr Corbyn said it was ""not a presidential election"". He was responding to a question on whether he has been a hindrance on the doorstep, amid reports that some candidates are finding voters do not want to support him personally. Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the voters she has met on the campaign trail are fixed on the two central characters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn - they are so well-known. She says both have bands of ""true believers"" but the men who are vying to be prime minister are also facing very serious doubts from some of the public. The battleground is no longer just on the doorstep and campaign trail - as we know, it's online too. On Facebook,the parties splurged the cash. At one point earlier this month, the Facebook Ad Library showed that about 2,500 adverts paid for by the Conservative Party were live, compared with 3,000 for the Liberal Democrats, but only 250 for Labour. And this time, there were also non-party groupssending Facebook users ads. But there has been some criticism of the way platforms have been used. The Conservatives were criticised for posting an edited video of Labour's Keir Starmer on their social media andfor rebranding their @CCHQPress account- the Tory press office - as ""factcheckUK"" during the ITV debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn. And Labour wasquestioned over a claim posted on Facebookthat a Conservative trade deal with the US after Brexit could cost the NHS up to Â£500m a week, by driving up the price of medicines. Now, a campaign group is calling for fact-checking of political advertising to be a legal requirementafter what it describes as a ""fake news and disinformation general election"". But controversy over social media election campaign posts has potentially helped to spread political messages,according to one media analyst. In recent days we've seen misinformation over the case of the four-year-old boy, Jack, who was pictured on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary after being admitted with suspected pneumonia. The hospital apologised and despite a statement from the hospital's chief medical officer,numerous posts spread on social media claiming the photo was staged. Our Reality Check team have been busy fact-checking claims throughout this campaign,see more from them here. Are these the 6 most controversial numbers so far? This video can not be played What Andrew Neil wants to ask Boris Johnson Boris Johnson faced accusations that he was ""running scared"" from scrutiny after failing to take part in a sit-down BBC interview with Andrew Neil - something that led the presenter to issue a direct challenge to the PM. Mr Johnson did not face Neil - like the other main party leaders - but the Tory party leader says he has taken part in two head-to-head debates and ""118 sit-down interviews with journalists"" during the campaign. And Channel 4 ""empty chaired"" the Tories and the Brexit Party with ice sculptures during its climate change debate. The Tories complained to Ofcom over impartiality, but the regulator decided not to investigate. It concluded that the Conservative viewpoint had been given due weight. Andrew Neil issues interview challenge to Johnson In Hartlepool, a Leave-voting area, could long-held allegiances to Labour cause a political earthquake? We know that the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are targeting Labour Leave voters - while the Labour Party has been campaigning hard to keep them on side. During the campaign, both of the main party leaders have travelled to these areas - in north-east Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, which are said to form Labour's ""red wall"" - to make their pitches. Polling expert Sir John Curtice says if Mr Johnson is to win an overall majority, he is likely to have to win a significant number of marginal seats from Labour. Of Labour's 50 most marginal seats, 39 voted in favour of Leave in the 2016 referendum and in 16, more than 60% voted for Brexit. Sir John Curtice: Five things to watch for in the election Where are the seats that could turn the election? Remember ""strong and stable"" from the 2017 campaign? Well, that's long gone and, for the Conservatives, has been replaced with ""get Brexit done"", with Mr Johnson promising to take the UK out of the EU by 31 January. The party's campaign has been all about what the election was called over in the first place - Brexit. Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim For Labour they have hammered their message on the NHS - that if the Conservatives get into power that puts the NHS at risk of being ""on the table"" in any post-Brexit trade negotiations with the US - something the Tories have denied will happen. The Liberal Democrats, on the other hand, want to ""Stop Brexit. Build a brighter future"", and the SNP says it is ""stronger for Scotland"". The party has ""stop Brexit"" on the side of its battle bus. The SNP has been pushing for a second Scottish referendum, saying it is confident Labour would support a further vote if the party was in a minority government situation. This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket In what has seen to be a generally stable campaign, the last few days have proved rocky for both the Conservatives and Labour. Boris Johnsonwas criticised after initially refusing to look at a pictureof a sick four-year-old boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. An ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but he refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. Mr Johnson eventually looked at the picture and apologised to the family. This video can not be played Jonathan Ashworth: ""Of course it makes me look like a right plonker"" Then Labour's Jonathan Ashworth apologised to his party after he criticised Jeremy Corbyn in a secret recording by his Tory activist friend. In a recording leaked toTory-supporting website Guido Fawkes,external, Mr Ashworth is heard saying he did not believe Labour would win the election. Mr Ashworth has insisted he was ""joshing around"" in the conversation, while Mr Corbyn claimed the story was ""irrelevant"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson confronted by Extinction Rebellion protesters During this election, we've heard a number of ""green"" pledges and polling at the beginning of the campaignrevealed a potentially significant shift, elevating the environment to being among voters' top priorities. Greens co-leader Sian Berry called it the ""climate election"" at the campaign launch for the Green Party of England and Wales, saying ""some things are even bigger than Brexit"". A Friends of the Earth survey suggested thatLabour had the strongest policies to protect natureand combat climate change. Its election pledges narrowly beat the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats - with the Conservatives far behind, according to the environmental campaign group. This video can not be played What to look out for on climate change and the environment in this election And climate change protesters in bee costumes from Extinction Rebellion glued themselves to the Liberal Democrats' electric bus, as well as the Conservatives' bus. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson defended her party's climate change policy to protesters in bee costumes, who said the plans were ""not ambitious enough"". Which parties want to tax frequent flyers? The election campaign has been marked by calls for tactical voting from both sides in the Brexit debate. Prof Stephen Fisher, an election analyst at the University of Oxford, says: ""Among Leave supporters, tactical voting is likely to come into play in constituencies where the Brexit Party and the Conservatives are competing to take a seat from a party that is sympathetic to another referendum. ""Tactical voting among Remain supporters is much more complicated because it involves more parties, with varying Brexit policies."" He says that relatively small changes in the number of votes a candidate receiveshave the potential to make a big difference. This video can not be played BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg sums up the election campaign In terms of the trends, our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says that actually, not much has changed during this campaign. The Tories have been broadly ahead for most of the time, with Labour struggling to close the gap, and the Lib Dems haven't made the kind of breakthrough people thought they might do a few months ago. And the SNP look likely to stay dominant in Scotland. Can the SNP retain its dominance in Scotland? Polling expert Sir John Curtice says there have been two trends in the polls during this campaign - but they have effectively negated each other. The Conservative vote is up - but so is the Labour vote, with the Brexit Party and Lib Dems being squeezed by both parties. ""The net effect on the Conservative lead has been effectively zero,"" Sir John says. What difference could tactical voting make? At the beginning of the campaign, BBC analysis of Press Association figures found 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates were women. That's an increase from 2015's record of 1,033 - but in 2017, just 973 female candidates took part in that year's snap election, according to research by the House of Commons library. There have been concerns that levels of abuse on social media might deter women from standing, with a number of high-profile former female ministers citing this as their main reason for quitting frontline politics. There are also 205 independent candidates standing - and several are recognisable faces, including former Tories David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, who were all expelled from the Conservative Party after rebelling over Brexit. Record number of women set to stand in election We've seen both sides channel the 2003 romantic comedy Love, Actually, using a famous scene in which a man uses a series of placards to tell a woman he loves her - but adding an election twist. Labour's Tooting candidate, Rosena Allin-Khan, posted her video first on social media, which showed her targeting a Tory supporter on the doorstep. This was followed by a version from the Conservatives, with Boris Johnson urging voters to back him. You can see a full list of Tooting candidateshere. We were also treated to Christmas-themed questions from interviewers, including at the first head-to-head live TV debate on ITV - when Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were asked what presents they would leave under each other's trees this year. Mr Corbyn went for a copy of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol so Mr Johnson ""could then understand how nasty Scrooge was"". The PM offered up his Brexit deal as a good read, but when reminded the answer was meant to be non-political, he changed his answer to some damson jam. Asked on BBC West Midlands Radio what he would get his partner Carrie Symonds for Christmas, Mr Johnson - staying on message - insisted he would ""get Brexit done"". Now it's down to voters to decide what election result they want for Christmas. Who are the UK's three million tactical voters?

Johnson and Corbyn make last pitches of campaignThe party leaders talk to the BBC in the final hours before polls open on Thursday morning.Election 2019,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are competing for the keys to No 10 Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are focusing on Brexit and public services in their final hours of campaigning. In their last interviews with the BBC ahead of Thursday's poll, Mr Johnson repeated his main pledges, saying: ""Only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward."" Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said there was a ""greater understanding"" from the public that the country ""cannot go on with underfunded public services"". The polls will open at 07:00 GMT. Both leaders held their final rallies in London on Wednesday night. Leaders in final push for votes ahead of election WATCH: What's the election been about? Other party leaders also travelled the country on the last day before the election to win support from undecided voters. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said votes for her party could stop Brexit, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for her party was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"". Nigel Farage warned against Mr Johnson's deal to leave the EU, calling for voters in Leave seats to back his Brexit Party. And Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Talking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said he thought the election result would be ""very close"", and that ""every vote counts"". Asked if he deserved to win, he said: ""I do think that we have the best programme for the country, we have an amazing agenda. We want to unite and level up across the country."" Mr Johnson said the Conservatives' plans - including a law to ensure extra funding for the NHS every year and 20,000 new police offices -  were ""fantastically ambitious"". He added: ""We can achieve all of these things. But we can't if our politics is paralysed by Brexit. We have to move it forward."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""The choice is absolutely stark"" Asked about his reaction to the photo of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a hospital due to a lack of beds, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously I think that anybody who experiences a bad time in the NHS has my full, full sympathies. ""We've all been there and anybody who has had a bad experience in A&E will know exactly how that family feels, and that is why I want to concentrate on getting cash into the NHS, taking the country forward."" But he reiterated that ""only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward"". Speaking at his final rally in London, Mr Johnson there was ""24 hours to break the deadlock"". He said the Conservative government would ""make sure we give our children and grandchildren the future they deserve in this country"". Mr Johnson ended by saying: ""Let's get Brexit done and take this incredible country forwards together."" Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Corbyn said he had a ""hunch"" that the polling experts -who have predicted a solid leader for the Conservatives over Labour- ""may just have got it wrong"". ""We have travelled all round the country and the enthusiasm of our party's supporters working together to get out there with our message is incredible - and I think that message is getting through,"" he said. ""I think the support is growing and there is a greater understanding that we cannot go on with underfunded public services and a government that has not been straightforward with us on Brexit or the trade talks with the USA."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We're going to win this thing"" Asked about candidates who have expressed concerns about negative feedback on the doorsteps - including a leaked recording of shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth casting doubts on Labour's chances in the poll - Mr Corbyn said: ""You show me a candidate at any election that isn't worried from any party. ""Being a candidate means you get worried. But I tell you what, we are going to win this thing."" If there is a Labour government on Friday morning, Mr Corbyn said the first thing he would do was ""deal with the worst levels of poverty in Britain"" - namely the homeless - saying: ""Something must be done very quickly, very urgently and that is what we are going to do."" Also holding his final rally in London, Mr Corbyn said the country was ""literally at a fork in the road"". He told supporters there had ""never been a clearer choice"" in British history than at this election, and that his party would redistribute wealth and power ""in a way that's never been seen before"". Mr Corbyn concluded with a poem, saying: ""My guitar is not for the rich. No, nothing like that. My song is of the ladder we are building to reach the stars.""

Who won the election battle online?,"Labour supporters swamped Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites during the 2017 general election. The online surge was widely seen - if mostly in hindsight - asan indicator that many polls were wrongand that Labour were running the Conservatives much closer than expected. And so it came to pass. What's different this time? The big online story during the 2017 general election was the influence of a host of pro-Labour websites. The Toriesspent more on paid adverts, but stories and posts hostile to the Conservatives and sympathetic to Jeremy Corbyn and Labour went more viral, more often. Many of these stories were produced by little known left-wing news sites. Because they're not fuelled by paid advertising, such posts are called ""organic"". But since 2017, changes to Facebook's algorithm - the code determining which posts get seen - have made it much harder for these sites to reach massive numbers of people. When it comes to dishing out organic content to users, Facebook is now more likely to recommend posts from family and friends, and less likely to show you things from organisations and media outlets. That's not the only development. While the ecosystem of left-wing Facebook pages and groups is still a big deal, two rival spheres of influence have grown in size. One is passionately in favour of Brexit. The other is vehemently opposed. At the heart of these three networks are volunteer activists working from living rooms and bathtubs up and down the UK, running Facebook pages and groups that, despite the algorithm changes, still attract millions of likes, comments and shares. The unknown influencers who are reaching millions The pro and anti-Brexit spheres don't uniformly identify with one party the way the pro-Corbyn networks do. At the start of the election they were the source of bitter internal feuds. On the Leave side, there were fights over whether to support the Brexit Party or the Conservatives. In the Remain universe, Labour and Lib Dem supporters were at each other's throats. That picture has changed substantially. Following Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage's decision to stand aside in Conservative seats, the pro-Brexit online universe now seems far more united behind Boris Johnson's Conservatives. On the Remain side, there's lots more talk of tactical voting, but as it's often hard to make a call as to whether Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP or another party are best placed to beat the Tories in a particular seat, arguments have continued. Could tactical voting kick Boris Johnson out of Downing Street? Or will uniting Leave voters keep him there? The pro- and anti-Brexit pages and groups are full of vocal activists, but not everyone shouts loudly online. There are of course plenty of voters who aren't on social media at all. They tend to be older people who skew Conservative. But added to that, administrators and users of local Facebook groups told us Conservative voters are, anecdotally, generally shyer when it comes to posting online. Has politics hijacked your local Facebook group? But there's another group that's gone pretty quiet on Facebook. Younger people have migrated to other social networks - chief among them Instagram - in large numbers since 2017. They are now less likely to engage on Facebook, and more likely to see, for instance, Instagram screenshots of Jeremy Corbyn tweets posted by singer Lily Allen (1.2 million followers) or fitness influencers like Grace Beverley (1 million followers). Those interactions are hard to track - but we do know it's happening in a big way, and is more likely to include pro-Labour messaging. Beyond the Facebook battle, there could be a new ""shy Tory"" wave brewing, or we could be missing a rare confirmed sighting of theoften-predicted ""youthquake""- or perhaps both. Smartphone use continues to rise, and continues to transform the nature of political campaigning. Recent research by media regulator Ofcom says our phones encourage ""passive news consumption"" with people prioritising ""quantity over depth in their news intake"". Parties and activists are trying to punch through with very simple posts - like screenshotted tweets - or dramatic and confrontational videos. Many viral hits were clips from old-school broadcast outlets in which a politician was perceived to have done badly in an interview. For example a video of Conservative minister Nicky Morgan struggling in an ITV interview about nurse numbers received around 14m views across various accounts on Facebook and Twitter.

Most of the top viral videos of the campaign were pro-Labour, a testament to the enduring strength of those pro-Corbyn social media networks. However, a couple of pro-Conservative posts managed to rack up significant numbers. The biggest was probably one of Boris Johnson informally chatting to a camera, ostensibly during a tea break.

If there's one image that's cut through in the final week of the campaign, it's that of four-year-old Jack sleeping on a hospital floor. The misinformation war over the boy in the hospital But will that push enough voters away from the Conservatives to make a difference? Or will the Tory attempt to deliver a clear message on Brexit cut through? If there was ever any suggestion that what happens online and offline elections aren't intimately connected, let it end here. In 2019 we've found internet campaigning just bleeds into everything, with online and offline events bouncing off each other and interacting in curious and unexpected ways. In the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye we unpicked the story of a misleading bar chart which started in a Facebook group and later landed on people's doormats on a paper leaflet, only to be criticised and mocked with memes online. Bar chart wars: The online battle over a disputed graph Hastings was one of the places that saw a battle over bar charts In South Yorkshire we found out how a local group shapes how one town experiences an election, with gentle chat about wheelie-bins and hedgehogs making way for spicy political arguments. Has politics hijacked your local Facebook group? Even people who don't use Facebook are often aware of these local groups and indirectly receive information from them. In many cases, these groups are more influential than the local media. Could the very local arguments and micronuggets of news which spread in some of these groups lead to some surprise results? We've been spending every day of the campaign trawling through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. It sometimes feel like everyone is constantly shouting at each other about the election, spreading dubious claims and counter-claims, and picking apart the latest slip-up by a politician in a TV interview. But most voters don't experience elections in this way. One screenshotted tweet, one Facebook rant or one piece of viral misinformation may punch through the news feed noise of dog photos and football videos and affect the way someone votes.

New Jersey killers 'targeted Jewish supermarket',"This video can not be played Witnesses described hearing rounds of gunfire during the incident A Jewish supermarket in New Jersey was the target of a gun attack which left six people dead including two suspected assailants, say officials. No motive has been confirmed, but the mayor of Jersey City tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city. The suspects are believed to have killed a detective across town, then driven a rental van to the store. Security video shows them firing on the market before going inside. Investigators believe that the three people found dead inside the kosher market were killed by the attackers, who were also found dead inside the building following a four-hour standoff with police on Tuesday. An additional victim was injured, but managed to escape, authorities said on Wednesday. The mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop. Public safety director James Shea said video showed they parked their van ""and immediately began firing on the location"". Asked how police were certain that the shop was targeted, he said the men had ""bypassed"" many other people walking on the street to attack the store. The attackers have been identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. Sources tell NBC that Anderson was a follower of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites. A neighbour told NBC that Graham was a former home carer in Manhattan and had met Anderson after she got hurt at work. The New York Times and New York Post reported on Wednesday that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack. Dozens of armed officers were deployed as the suspects took shelter at the supermarket The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The suspects killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, New Jersey Attorney-General Gurbir Grewal said. The pair fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire. On Wednesday, the Jersey City Mayor Fulop said ""had they not been there and not responded, more people would have died"". Mr Grewal said officials were ""not in the position at this time to say definitively why the suspects decided to stop in front of the supermarket and begin firing immediately"". The threat of rising anti-Semitism ""This is one of the biggest gunfights I've seen in a while,"" Willy McDonald, 67, told the New York Times. ""And I've been in Vietnam."" An active pipe bomb was found in the suspects' vehicle, police say. Reports indicate that a rambling note was also left inside for police to find. The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers. Three people in the shop were killed The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. Class start times were delayed on Wednesday. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured. They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49 and Moshe Deutch, 24. ""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five. ""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short."" Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out. Moshe Deutch, 24 Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"" and ordered police on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference. He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously."" New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said.

New Zealand volcano death toll rises to eight,"The White Island volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted on Monday Two people who were being treated in hospital after the eruption of New Zealand's White Island volcano have died, bringing the official number of victims to eight, police say. Nine people are still officially missing, presumed dead, and efforts to retrieve bodies from the island were put on hold on Wednesday amid signs of increased seismic activity. Another 20 people are in intensive care with severe burns. Five have been moved to Australia. Australian brothers Matthew Hollander, 13, and Berend Hollander, 16, have died in hospital, their school confirmed on Thursday. The volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted on Monday when dozens of tourists were on the island. Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption Can we predict volcanic eruptions? Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said several more Australians were missing and presumed dead, adding on Thursday: ""In the days ahead, there will be worse news."" Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said: ""I've spoken to many of those involved in the operation and they are very, very eager to get back there, they want to bring people's loved ones home"". Mother and daughter Julie and Jessica Richards, aged 47 and 20, are among the dead White Island is a popular tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. At least 47 visitors from around the world were on the volcano crater at the time of two explosions in quick succession. White Island volcano: Why skin is being imported Police Minister Stuart Nash explained the injuries to the survivors were so severe that some of them were unable to identify themselves. ""There are a number of people in hospital who cannot communicate, they have significant burns not only to skin but internal organs,"" he told Radio New Zealand. ""We wish them the best but we're not out of the woods yet, of that there's no doubt."" Dr Peter Watson, chief medical officer at New Zealand's National Burns Unit, said an estimated 1.2m sq cm of replacement skin would be needed for the patients. An order has been placed from the US. Several patients would be transferred to Australia by the Australian Defence Force using an intensive-care acceptable aircraft, Dr Watson said. Analysis by James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent Donated skin is vital for helping to save the life of a major burns patient. Skin is our largest organ and its main job is keeping dangerous viruses and bacteria out. The damage caused by severe burns leaves patients at very high risk of infection. Donor skin is a short-term fix. It comes from dead organ donors - in the same way as hearts, kidneys and corneas - and can be banked for several years. The donor skin aids healing, cuts the risk of infection and can reduce pain. The immune system is so weak after such an injury that rejection is not an issue. A single major burns patient needs a lot of donor skin. New Zealand is treating many at the same time and has needed to turn to other countries for help. New Zealand's chief coroner on Wednesday declared the eruption a ""mass fatality incident"". Officials said they were working with disaster specialists and forensic experts to identify the victims so their bodies could be returned to their families. There have been many tributes for the victims in the nearby port town New Zealand police have now listed nine people as officially missing,external- though they say this is a partial list as they have not been able to speak to all the next of kin. These are: Hayden Inman (New Zealand) Tipene Maangi (New Zealand) Julie Richards (Australia) Jessica Richards (Australia) Gavin Dallow (Australia) Zoe Hosking (Australia) Richard Elzer (Australia) Karla Matthews (Australia) Krystal Browitt (Australia) At least seven people on the list are believed to be dead or presumed dead, based on relatives talking to media. The parents of the Hollander brothers, Martin and Barbara Hollander, are not on the list but remain missing. Tour guide Hayden Inman was identified as among the dead by his brother on Facebook. Julie Richards and her daughter Jessica from Brisbane, Australia, were identified as victims by a family spokesperson. In pictures: White Island eruption Adelaide father Gavin Dallow has been named as dead, with his stepdaughter Zoe Hosking presumed dead, according to media reports. Australian tourist Jason Griffiths, who was travelling with Karla Matthews and Richard Elzer, died in hospital on Wednesday. According to a statement released by their friends, both Karla and Richard are presumed dead. There is also a definitive list of all victims who are in hospital but police say they cannot release this for privacy reasons. This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" On Wednesday morning,geological agency GeoNet said,external""the level of volcanic tremor has significantly increased at the island"". Scientists view tremors, which result from a release of energy under the Earth's surface, as one sign of a possible eruption. In a later update, the agency said volcanic tremor, known as seismic activity,was now at the highest level seen since 2016,external. ""The level of volcanic tremor continues to rise and there is medium likelihood of future eruptive activity in the next 24 hours,"" the agency said. A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At a news conference on Wednesday, volcanologist Graham Leonard said seismic activity on White Island was escalating. ""Yesterday there was a high risk of an eruption,"" Mr Leonard said. ""Today there is an even higher risk of an eruption. And the parameters are worsening at the moment."" Police said the latest seismology update meant recovery teams had no choice but to wait, but they were on constant standby to return to the island as soon as possible. Police Minister Nash said there were also poisonous gases coming from the volcanic vent and that the island was blanketed in a thick layer of acidic ash. With measuring equipment on the island still intact, GeoNet can give regular updates on the situation, allowing police to assess the risk of sending recovery teams. Reconnaissance flights have shown no signs of life on the island and officials believe there are no survivors among the missing. Police said a drone conducted four fly-overs of the island on Wednesday, and analysis of that footage was ongoing. Are you in the area?

"Supercuts strikes rescue deal saving 1,000 jobs","The owner of the Supercuts and Regis hairdressing chains, Regis UK, has been bought out of administration, saving 1,000 jobs. Entrepreneur Lee Bushell has agreed to buy 140 outlets trading under the two brands across the UK. But, as first reported by Sky News, the deal will also involve the closure of about 60 sites risking 200 jobs. Regis fell into administration in October blaming a ""perfect storm"" of pressures. It has been struggling with a fall in customer numbers in shopping centres where many of its salons are located. It also said higher wage costs had worsened its ""cash flow issues"". Clintons strikes deal to avoid Christmas collapse Peacocks set to rescue BonmarchÃ© from collapse Last year, it negotiated a cut in the rent it paid through a legal process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), but landlords challenged the proposals in court. Regis UK was sold by its US parent company to the private equity firm Regent in 2017. But it has faced a challenging retail environment since then, as people rein in their spending. Last week, card chain Clintons struck a deal to stop it going bust before Christmas, while baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration last month. A string of other firms has gone under including electronics retailer Maplin and discount chain Poundworld, while Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright have all been forced to restructure. Commenting on the Regis deal, Matt Cowlishaw, of administrators Deloitte, said: ""We are pleased to have concluded the sale and for being able to preserve a significant number of jobs at two well-known brands.""

Johnson and Corbyn make last pitches of campaign,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are competing for the keys to No 10 Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are focusing on Brexit and public services in their final hours of campaigning. In their last interviews with the BBC ahead of Thursday's poll, Mr Johnson repeated his main pledges, saying: ""Only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward."" Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said there was a ""greater understanding"" from the public that the country ""cannot go on with underfunded public services"". The polls will open at 07:00 GMT. Both leaders held their final rallies in London on Wednesday night. Leaders in final push for votes ahead of election WATCH: What's the election been about? Other party leaders also travelled the country on the last day before the election to win support from undecided voters. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said votes for her party could stop Brexit, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward."" The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for her party was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"". Nigel Farage warned against Mr Johnson's deal to leave the EU, calling for voters in Leave seats to back his Brexit Party. And Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Talking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said he thought the election result would be ""very close"", and that ""every vote counts"". Asked if he deserved to win, he said: ""I do think that we have the best programme for the country, we have an amazing agenda. We want to unite and level up across the country."" Mr Johnson said the Conservatives' plans - including a law to ensure extra funding for the NHS every year and 20,000 new police offices -  were ""fantastically ambitious"". He added: ""We can achieve all of these things. But we can't if our politics is paralysed by Brexit. We have to move it forward."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""The choice is absolutely stark"" Asked about his reaction to the photo of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a hospital due to a lack of beds, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously I think that anybody who experiences a bad time in the NHS has my full, full sympathies. ""We've all been there and anybody who has had a bad experience in A&E will know exactly how that family feels, and that is why I want to concentrate on getting cash into the NHS, taking the country forward."" But he reiterated that ""only if you get Brexit done [can you] move the country forward"". Speaking at his final rally in London, Mr Johnson there was ""24 hours to break the deadlock"". He said the Conservative government would ""make sure we give our children and grandchildren the future they deserve in this country"". Mr Johnson ended by saying: ""Let's get Brexit done and take this incredible country forwards together."" Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Corbyn said he had a ""hunch"" that the polling experts -who have predicted a solid leader for the Conservatives over Labour- ""may just have got it wrong"". ""We have travelled all round the country and the enthusiasm of our party's supporters working together to get out there with our message is incredible - and I think that message is getting through,"" he said. ""I think the support is growing and there is a greater understanding that we cannot go on with underfunded public services and a government that has not been straightforward with us on Brexit or the trade talks with the USA."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We're going to win this thing"" Asked about candidates who have expressed concerns about negative feedback on the doorsteps - including a leaked recording of shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth casting doubts on Labour's chances in the poll - Mr Corbyn said: ""You show me a candidate at any election that isn't worried from any party. ""Being a candidate means you get worried. But I tell you what, we are going to win this thing."" If there is a Labour government on Friday morning, Mr Corbyn said the first thing he would do was ""deal with the worst levels of poverty in Britain"" - namely the homeless - saying: ""Something must be done very quickly, very urgently and that is what we are going to do."" Also holding his final rally in London, Mr Corbyn said the country was ""literally at a fork in the road"". He told supporters there had ""never been a clearer choice"" in British history than at this election, and that his party would redistribute wealth and power ""in a way that's never been seen before"". Mr Corbyn concluded with a poem, saying: ""My guitar is not for the rich. No, nothing like that. My song is of the ladder we are building to reach the stars.""

"The teenager who was groomed, hunted and murdered","Jaden Moodie moved from Nottingham to London with his mum for a ""new start"" The mother of a 14-year-old boy hunted down and knifed to death in gang violence said she will never forget the image of her youngest child lying face down in a pool of his blood. Jaden Moodie was dealing drugs on 8 January in Leyton, north-east London, when he was mowed down by a car. As he lay in the road, he was repeatedly stabbed by a rival gang. One of his attackers - 19-year-old Ayoub Majdouline wasfound guilty of his murder on Wednesday.Jaden's mother explains how her son became embroiled in a drug turf war. The 14-year-old was stabbed to death in Bickley Road, Leyton Jada Bailey was cooking at home in Walthamstow when she got a knock on the door on the evening of 8 January. ""It was Jaden's friends. They told me that he was not responding. I didn't know what they were talking about at first,"" she said. Jaden had been riding down Bickley Road on a moped at about 18:30 when a Mercedes ploughed into him head on, launching him over the car's bonnet. He was then set upon and stabbed to death within seconds. ""I ran [there] with my two daughters,"" Jada said. ""Everything was taped off and there were lots of police and paramedics. I will never forget being pulled to one side and being told Jaden was no longer with us. ""At that moment I was just in disbelief - in a state of shock. I asked immediately to see him - and when I saw him, he was laid out in the crucifixion pose. ""That image has not left me."" CCTV of the moment Jaden was knocked off a moped and stabbed to death was shown to jurors Jada said her son was caring and loving - but the trial into his murder revealed he had become increasingly troubled as he entered his teenage years. In March 2018 - by the time he was 13 - he was handed a youth conditional caution after police seized an air-powered pistol, a Rambo-style knife and cannabis during an altercation in Nottingham. Four months later, Jada called police to say she had been threatened on her doorstep by a 16-year-old boy who told her Jaden owed him money - and if he did not pay, she and her son would be stabbed. Ten months after that she complained to social services that she had handed Â£300 to stop the boys from threatening her. She also said she had found a large knife in her home -  a clear sign, she thought, that her son was being groomed into a life of crime. Jaden pictured wearing his school uniform on his first day at the Redhill Academy in Nottingham Fearing for her family's life, Jada decided to move 140 miles from the market town of Arnold in Nottinghamshire to Waltham Forest in east London. But his mother said that despite being close to male role models like his uncles, the teenager was soon excluded from his new school in Chingford and lured back into criminality. Last year, he admitted appearing in a Snapchat video with an imitation firearm and was found with crack-cocaine at an address in Bournemouth. On the afternoon before being stabbed, Jaden had called a friend to tell him ""I'm in beef again"". It was only after his death that his mother learned of his involvement with one of the biggest and most organised gangs in Waltham Forest - the ""Beaumont Crew"". He had been dealing cannabis for the gang when he was set upon by his rivals, the ""Mali Boys"". Waltham Forest has been carved up into various, bitter, postcode rivalries There are currently 12 gangs who are active in the east London borough The Beaumont Crew is the biggest and longest established gang with about 100 members and is based in the E10 area The gang generally operates in the Beaumont Estate - where they take their name from The younger gang members - between the ages of 12 and 17 - are becoming increasingly active in street level crime both as victims and perpetrators The Mali Boys gang is based in the E10 and E17 postcode areas It has a gang leadership size of about 40 people and its gang elders are from the Somali community of the borough It is heavily involved in child criminal exploitation and there is active grooming of vulnerable young children Mali Boys has a number of rival gangs, including the Beaumont Crew, to which Jaden Moodie was linked Source: London South Bank University: From Postcodes to Profit Ayoub Majdouline and four other boys were part of the Mali Boys gang and on 8 January were cruising the streets around Bickley Road in a stolen Mercedes. They had covered their hands and faces, armed themselves with knives and were looking for trouble. Jaden was in the area at the same time, having visited a youth bus run by Christian charity, Worth Unlimited. He then set off down Bickley Road on a moped. It was here where Majdouline and his accomplices spotted the teenager and drove the Mercedes right at him. Majdouline, wearing yellow washing up gloves, got out of the car with three other boys and repeatedly stabbed the 14-year-old in the back while he lay on the ground. He suffered nine stab wounds in the 14-second attack and bled to death in the road. Blood-stained rubber gloves worn by Majdouline were found near the crime scene Forensic practitioner Ian Hounsell, who was nearby, told jurors he could hear the teenager ""grunting"" and that he noticed several slit marks at the back of his jacket. He administered CPR, but the 14-year-old was pronounced dead just after 19:00 GMT. ""The way in which he died was barbaric,"" Jada said. ""How could they [his attackers] do that - to a child?"" During the trial, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said these young men had ""no qualms about carrying and using deadly weapons to kill, no qualms about attacking their victim on a public street, and no qualms about playing out their petty rivalries using the blade of a knife."" Jurors heard social services were worried Majdouline was being groomed by sophisticated adult dealers and he was identified by the National Crime Agency in 2018 as a victim of ""modern slavery"", amid concerns of exploitation. Giving evidence, the defendant told the court how he sold drugs ""for and with"" the Mali Boys, including county lines deals in Basingstoke, Ipswich and Andover. He had been caught with drugs and carrying knives, but despite serving time went back to dealing. ""I was not getting really any money from social services - Â£50 a week. Everyone in Leyton that I knew was selling drugs to make money so I just thought... to survive. ""I was selling drugs for this older guy. He didn't want me to get robbed or lose his drugs so he gave me a knife for my own safety."" Majdouline said he carried a knife for his own safety The relative naivety of Jaden's attackers was highlighted in the way they tried to get rid of the evidence in the moments after the murder. The obviously damaged Mercedes, which had Jaden's blood on the bonnet, was abandoned in a cul-de-sac five minutes away from Bickley Road. Blood-stained yellow rubber gloves worn by Majdouline and the knife used in the attack, both covered in the defendant's DNA, were put down a drain near the abandoned car. Majdouline was seen on CCTV buying cigarettes at Bercey Food and Wine shop 10 minutes after Jaden was murdered, while the T-shirt, jeans and Nike Air Max trainers he wore during the attack were found in a burnt pile opposite the shop, in the grounds of St Mary's Church on Church Road. Majdouline's burnt clothing was found in the grounds of St Mary's Church in Leyton The evidence was enough to convince a jury of eight men and four women that Majdouline was guilty of Jaden's murder. Two other males arrested for their involvement in the attack remain under investigation. The Met said it was committed to bringing all five people in the Mercedes to justice. ""No child is safe while Jaden's [uncaught attackers] are on the streets of London,"" said Jada. ""Since 8 January, more people have died and something has to change. ""My son will not be dying in vain because I will save more children like that around here - the ones who have been excluded from school particularly."" Jaden's mother has set up a foundation for vulnerable children following the death of her son Research by City Hall showed more than 4,000 people in London wererecruited by gangs to supply drugs through networks across the UK in the last year. Almost half of these were aged between 15 and 19, while 29% were aged from 20 to 25. Jaden, who lied about his age to other gang members, was believed to be the youngest member of the Beaumont Crew. He was also the youngest murder victim in London since 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis was shot in 2017. Jada has set up the Jaden Moodie Movement - a foundation to provide safe spaces for vulnerable children and young adults. ""We loved our son and he did have structure. But certain individuals and structures failed him,"" she said. ""Now we want to help these kids get off the streets and show them that there is a better future to be had away from drugs and knives. ""If there are people on our streets capable of killing a 14-year-old child, then no one is safe. No more children need to die.""

Greta Thunberg is youngest Time Person of the Year,"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg criticised CEOs and politicians for their lack of action Greta Thunberg, the Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a global movement to fight climate change, has been named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. The 16-year-old is the youngest person to be chosen by the magazine in a tradition that started in 1927. Speaking at a UN climate change summit in Madrid before the announcement, she urged world leaders to stop using ""creative PR"" to avoid real action. The next decade would define the planet's future, she said. Last year, the teenager started an environmental strike by missing lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. It sparked a worldwide movement that became popular with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. Since then, she has become a strong voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. Earlier this year, she wasnominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is Greta Thunberg? Island nation's 'fight to death' What is climate change? Where we are in seven charts At the UN Climate Conference in New York in September, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. In a now-famous speech, she said: ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We'll be watching you."" Reacting to the nomination on Twitter,external, the activist said: ""Wow, this is unbelievable! I share this great honour with everyone in the #FridaysForFuture movement and climate activists everywhere."" Time magazine's cover for its Person of the Year edition The teenager's message, however, has not been well received by everyone, most notably prominent conservative voices. Before her appearance in Madrid, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro called her a ""brat"" after she expressed concern about the killing of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. ""Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,"" Mr Bolsonaro told reporters. ""It's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,"" he said, using the Portuguese word for brat, ""pirralha"". The activist responded by briefly changing her Twitter bio to ""Pirralha"". She has previously been at odds with US President Donald Trump, who has questioned climate science and rolled back many US climate laws, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who once called her a ""kind but poorly informed teenager"". This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Announcing Time's decision on NBC, editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said: ""She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement."" The magazine's tradition, which started as Man of the Year, recognises the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"". Last year, it named murdered and imprisoned journalists, calling them ""The Guardians"". At the COP25 Climate Conference in Madrid, Greta Thunberg accused world powers of making constant attempts ""to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition"". ""The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when, in fact, almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" she said, drawing applause. ""In just three weeks we'll enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future,"" she added. ""Right now, we're desperate for any sign of hope."" This was meant to be a big moment in the talks, the elixir of the ""Greta effect"" bringing new energy to a flagging process.  The teenager is almost certainly the most famous person here, attracting far more attention than other celebrities like Al Gore, and the UN badly needs a boost. Her talk came over as measured, grounded in the latest research, and avoided the flash of hurt and anger she displayed in New York in September. Looking around the hall, it was striking how many of the national delegations had not turned up for this morning session at the conference. A snub by the big fossil fuel economies? Or maybe they were too busy in the negotiations themselves? In any event, the passion among the millions of young people who have taken to the streets to demand action on climate change feels very remote from the diplomatic struggles in these halls. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission - the EU executive - announced ambitious environmental proposals to cut the bloc's dependency on fossil fuels, hoping to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on 1 December, called theEuropean Green Deal,externalEurope's ""man on the Moon moment"". It includes proposals that affect everything from transport and buildings to food production, and air and water pollution. The package will be debated by EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and includes: A â¬100bn (Â£84bn; $110bn) mechanism to help countries still heavily dependent on fossil fuels to transition to renewable energy sources Proposals to tighten the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for 2030 A law that will set the EU ""onto an irreversible path to climate neutrality"" by 2050 A plan to promote a more circular economy - a system designed to eliminate waste - that will address more sustainable products as well as a ""farm to fork"" strategy to improve the sustainability of food production and distribution Reacting to the proposals, Jagoda Munic, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe, said they were ""too small, too few and too far off"", adding: ""We're on a runaway train to ecological and climate collapse and the EU Commission is gently switching gears instead of slamming on the brakes.""

New Jersey killers 'targeted' Jewish supermarket,"This video can not be played Witnesses described hearing rounds of gunfire during the incident A Jewish supermarket in New Jersey was the target of a gun attack which left six people dead including two suspected assailants, say officials. No motive has been confirmed, but the mayor of Jersey City tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city. The suspects are believed to have killed a detective across town, then driven a rental van to the store. Security video shows them firing on the market before going inside. Investigators believe that the three people found dead inside the kosher market were killed by the attackers, who were also found dead inside the building following a four-hour standoff with police on Tuesday. An additional victim was injured, but managed to escape, authorities said on Wednesday. The mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop. Public safety director James Shea said video showed they parked their van ""and immediately began firing on the location"". Asked how police were certain that the shop was targeted, he said the men had ""bypassed"" many other people walking on the street to attack the store. The attackers have been identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. Sources tell NBC that Anderson was a follower of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites. A neighbour told NBC that Graham was a former home carer in Manhattan and had met Anderson after she got hurt at work. The New York Times and New York Post reported on Wednesday that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack. Dozens of armed officers were deployed as the suspects took shelter at the supermarket The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The suspects killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, New Jersey Attorney-General Gurbir Grewal said. The pair fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire. On Wednesday, the Jersey City Mayor Fulop said ""had they not been there and not responded, more people would have died"". Mr Grewal said officials were ""not in the position at this time to say definitively why the suspects decided to stop in front of the supermarket and begin firing immediately"". The threat of rising anti-Semitism ""This is one of the biggest gunfights I've seen in a while,"" Willy McDonald, 67, told the New York Times. ""And I've been in Vietnam."" An active pipe bomb was found in the suspects' vehicle, police say. Reports indicate that a rambling note was also left inside for police to find. The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers. Three people in the shop were killed The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. Class start times were delayed on Wednesday. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured. They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49 and Moshe Deutch, 24. ""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five. ""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short."" Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out. Moshe Deutch, 24 Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"" and ordered police on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference. He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously."" New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said.

London Bridge shot might have passed through busA ricochet bullet from the London Bridge terror attack could have gone straight through a bus.,"This previously unpublished picture shows London Bridge soon after the attacker was shot - with the bus on the right that was hit A ricochet from a police bullet could have passed through the entire top deck of a bus during the London Bridge terror attack, pictures reveal. The police have suggested a ricochet could have hit the bus, stopped near to where attacker Usman Khan was shot. A picture given to BBC News by an eye witness on the bus behind showsa round hole and a shattered back window. But a closer examination of other photos from the bridge reveals a hole in the front window of the bus as well. The front window of the bus also appears to have been hit - with a forensic examination taking place The eye witness, who does not want to be named, believes the bus he was on was also clipped. He was at the front of the upper deck when he saw, heard and felt the impact of the back window of the bus in front shattering, and immediately dived to the floor. ""We are talking about a split-second of noise,"" he said. The picture given to BBC News by a passenger on the bus directly behind shows a round hole and a shattered back window ""In no more than a half-a-second I was on the floor."" It suggests there was more of a fortunate near miss than had previously been recognised - and might explain how the ricocheting bullet had reached the back window. Armed officers shot Khan after he had been tackled by members of the public using improvised weapons including fire extinguishers and a narwhal tusk. Khan had been chased from nearby Fishmongers' Hall, after a knife attack in which he had killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who had been working at a prison rehabilitation event at the hall. The damage to the bus seems to have happened after the initial shots that had stopped Khan, raising questions about further shots that might have been fired. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which is investigating, said that establishing the cause of damage to the bus was ""a line of enquiry for us"". 300 seconds on London Bridge London Bridge attacker attended untested rehabilitation courses Praise for public who stepped in to stop London Bridge attacker Dr Rachel Bolton-King, associate professor of forensic science at Staffordshire University says the specifics of what happened will have to be established by the formal investigation. But she says it might be possible for a ricocheted bullet to ""pass through one window, through the length of the bus and out the window at the opposite end of the bus"". ""Ricochet bullets are often unstable once they have hit their first target surface,"" she said. A close-up shows the hole in the front window of the bus, along with the reflections of nearby buildings They could continue ""nose on"" in the normal direction of flight but could also be deflected sideways or into other angles. And investigators would be able to find the direction of travel by examining the front and back surfaces of the window. Forensic investigators examined the damaged bus Philip Boyce, of forensic services company Forensic Equity, said the bullet could have entered through the front window and glanced off the ceiling of the bus before going out through the back. Ricochets could carry for hundreds of yards, depending on the surfaces they hit but well within the distance between the bus and the site of Khan's shooting, he said. And their path could be altered by what they hit or passed through, such as laminated or toughened glass. Transport for London confirmed that a bus was damaged during the incident - with the Metropolitan police suggesting that it could have been a ricochet from a police bullet.

The picture given to BBC News by a passenger on the bus directly behind shows a round hole and a shattered back window ""In no more than a half-a-second I was on the floor."" It suggests there was more of a fortunate near miss than had previously been recognised - and might explain how the ricocheting bullet had reached the back window. Armed officers shot Khan after he had been tackled by members of the public using improvised weapons including fire extinguishers and a narwhal tusk. Khan had been chased from nearby Fishmongers' Hall, after a knife attack in which he had killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who had been working at a prison rehabilitation event at the hall. The damage to the bus seems to have happened after the initial shots that had stopped Khan, raising questions about further shots that might have been fired. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which is investigating, said that establishing the cause of damage to the bus was ""a line of enquiry for us"". 300 seconds on London Bridge London Bridge attacker attended untested rehabilitation courses Praise for public who stepped in to stop London Bridge attacker Dr Rachel Bolton-King, associate professor of forensic science at Staffordshire University says the specifics of what happened will have to be established by the formal investigation. But she says it might be possible for a ricocheted bullet to ""pass through one window, through the length of the bus and out the window at the opposite end of the bus"". ""Ricochet bullets are often unstable once they have hit their first target surface,"" she said. A close-up shows the hole in the front window of the bus, along with the reflections of nearby buildings They could continue ""nose on"" in the normal direction of flight but could also be deflected sideways or into other angles. And investigators would be able to find the direction of travel by examining the front and back surfaces of the window. Forensic investigators examined the damaged bus Philip Boyce, of forensic services company Forensic Equity, said the bullet could have entered through the front window and glanced off the ceiling of the bus before going out through the back. Ricochets could carry for hundreds of yards, depending on the surfaces they hit but well within the distance between the bus and the site of Khan's shooting, he said. And their path could be altered by what they hit or passed through, such as laminated or toughened glass. Transport for London confirmed that a bus was damaged during the incident - with the Metropolitan police suggesting that it could have been a ricochet from a police bullet.

Can you take a selfie at a polling station?,"This video can not be played BBC reporter Chi Chi Izundu explains what you can and can't do in the polling station on election day The general election takes place on Thursday, but what do you need to know about polling station etiquette? Here are the rules on everything from whether you can take a selfie to voting while drunk. Thedeadline for registering to votein this general election was on 26 November. If you are on the electoral register, you should have received a polling card with your polling number and polling station address. If you do not have a polling cardcontact your local authority's election office.,external You must vote at the polling station to which you have been assigned between 07:00 and 22:00 GMT on election day. If you are in a queue when the polls shut, you will be allowed to vote. This video can not be played How does a general election actually work? When you arrive, staff will take your details and in Northern Ireland, they will also request a form of photographic ID. You don't need your polling card, although it may speed things up. You will receive a ballot paper, featuring an official mark or number to combat fraud, and listing candidates and parties in your constituency. Take it to a screened booth, where you will find a pencil to vote with, although you can use your own pen if you prefer. Read the ballot paper carefully and then vote for your chosen candidate by putting an X in the box by their name. If you mark any more boxes, your paper will be invalid. However, if you make a mistake you can get another ballot paper, if you have not put it in the ballot box. Votes made with a tick or even a smiley facemay be counted if the voter's choice is clear,,externalbut will be disqualified otherwise. When you are ready, fold the ballot paper - for privacy - and put it in the box where the votes are collected. The Electoral Commission advises against it because it risks accidentally giving away how someone else voted, which is against the law. However, it adds that people are welcome to share photos taken outside a polling station ""to encourage your friends and family to vote"". Yes you can - but only about your vote and not anyone else's, so you are advised not to update your account inside the polling station. The punishment for revealing how another person voted - even accidentally - is up to Â£5,000, or six months in prison. You are not allowed to photograph the ballot paper you receive in a polling station - but you can snap your postal ballot paper, because electoral law treats them differently. Yes. Some people spoil their votes as a protest vote. These do not count towards any candidate, but are recorded. Only0.2% of votes were rejected,externalfor being invalid at the 2017 general election. Animals, apart from assistance dogs, are not usually allowed inside polling stations. The Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent you from wearing a slogan going into a polling station, with the intention of voting. You should, however, leave immediately afterwards as campaigning inside polling stations is not permitted, and this could be seen as doing just that. Yes. You can vote if you are drunk or under the influence of drugs, unless you are disruptive. POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external Yes - as long as you registered to vote by post, or appointed a proxy to vote on your behalf, in time. Before you go to vote - yes. Inside the polling station - definitely not, as political discussion is banned there. Staff will intervene if they hear any chat about candidates or parties. Yes they can, if they are registered to vote at your polling station, but they cannot enter the booth where you vote. If the friend is not registered there, they may be refused entry. This is up to polling station staff. Yes. Bringing children to the polling station is encouraged, because it is seen as educating them about democracy. But a child is not allowed to mark your vote on the ballot paper. Yes. The presiding officer can mark the paper for you, or a close family member aged 18 or over, or another eligible voter, like a support worker, can accompany you. If you have a visual impairment, you can ask for a device that lets you mark your own ballot paper. A large print version should also be available. This video can not be played Nikki Fox on the hurdles and options for disabled voters Polling stations are selected for accessibility. If a voter cannot enter the polling station because of a physical disability, the presiding officer may take the ballot paper to them. For help, call the Electoral Commission on 0333 103 1928. A dedicated helpline - 020 7696 6009 - for anyone with a learning disability, their families and carers, and polling station staff, has also been set up by Mencap. You can, but it may mean your vote won't be counted. If you wish to vote for a candidate you should avoid writing comments in the margin. It might confuse the counters and lead to your vote being deemed doubtful and subsequently rejected. People do occasionally sign their ballots, but if the name is identifiable then again your vote will not count. No. It is entirely up to you whether or not you vote. The average turnout in the UK for general elections since 1918 has been 72.9%. We can't tell you - we are the BBC and have strict impartiality rules - but if you want to read around, here's a link to ourparty guidesandour manifesto guide. Some people choose to vote tactically in an election -this is what that means. Staff are recruited by local councils. Jobs available include being the presiding officer, conducting the ballot, counting the votes and processing the postal votes. These roles are paid at different rates, with some councils offering more than Â£300 for certain positions. The votes will start to be counted as soon as the polls close. Constituencies will start to declare their results within the first few hours of the vote. A large number are expected between 03:00 and 05:00 GMT on Friday.

Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor. She first learned about climate change when she was eight.

The protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined herFridays For Future strikes. Mr Thunberg says his daughter became ""much happier"" after she started campaigning. She has described her autism diagnosis as a ""superpower"" which helped motivate her protests. ""Being different is a gift,""she told the BBC. ""If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike.""

London homicides highest for year since 2008The stabbing of a 47-year-old man took the number of killings in the capital to 142 since 1 January.London,"The number of homicides has hit the highest number since 2008 when there was 154 The number of killings in London has topped last year's total and is the highest annual number for more than a decade, police figures show. The fatal stabbing of 47-year-old James O'Keefe in Hornsey onMonday took the capital's 2019's homicide rate to 142. The figure, which includes murders and manslaughters, is the highest number since 2008, a year when the Met investigated 154 deaths. The force said a total of 133 homicides were recorded in 2018. This year's figure includes 137 homicide investigations by the Met, two by British Transport Police and thetwo fatal stabbings at London Bridge last month, investigated by City of London Police. More than half of 2019's victims were stabbed to death and23 were teenagers- the highest number of such victims for more than a decade - figures collated by the BBC shows. ""Each one of these cases is a tragedy, not just for the victims, their families and friends, but also for our wider communities who are left reeling by these acts of senseless violence,"" a police spokesman said. ""Tackling violence is the number one priority for the Metropolitan Police Service. One homicide, one stabbing, one violent incident, is simply one too many."" Jaden Moodie, 14, was the youngest person to be killed in the capital, in 2019 Jaden Moodie,14, was the youngest person to be killed in the capital, in 2019. Ayoub Majdouline, 19 and from Wembley,was found guilty of his murder on Wednesday. Jodie was stabbed in the back in an unprovoked attack as she sat in a park in East London on 1 March Jodie Chesney, who was stabbed to death in east London, was another teenager to die this year. The 17-year-old was knifed in the back as she sat with friends in Harold Hill, on 1 March. Fatal teen stabbings in London at 11-year high Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and Arron Isaacs, 17, of Barking, were both convicted last month of her murder, following an eight-week trial at the Old Bailey. Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent These are undoubtedly worrying figures for Londoners - and for the Met. In spite of a huge amount of effort and resource, which has contributed to a decline in stabbings and gun crime over the past 12 months, overall violence, including cases of murder and manslaughter, is still on the rise. However, the number of killings is not at levels seen in the 1990s and early 2000s when there were usually upwards of 160 such deaths each year. And, compared with other cities, London remains relatively safe. For example, in New York, which has a slightly lower population than London's nine million, there has been more than double the number of murders - 298 by the beginning of December. Over recent years, the homicide rate (killings as a proportion of the population) has been higher in other large cities in Europe, such as Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, even though numerically there has been more in London. The figures provide some perspective, but of course, they are of no comfort to the loved ones of those who have died in the capital this year. Lib Peck, Director of the Violence Reduction Unit at City Hall, says the number of those aged in their 20s, who are injured by knives, is beginning to drop.

London homicides highest for year since 2008,"The number of homicides has hit the highest number since 2008 when there was 154 The number of killings in London has topped last year's total and is the highest annual number for more than a decade, police figures show. The fatal stabbing of 47-year-old James O'Keefe in Hornsey onMonday took the capital's 2019's homicide rate to 142. The figure, which includes murders and manslaughters, is the highest number since 2008, a year when the Met investigated 154 deaths. The force said a total of 133 homicides were recorded in 2018. This year's figure includes 137 homicide investigations by the Met, two by British Transport Police and thetwo fatal stabbings at London Bridge last month, investigated by City of London Police. More than half of 2019's victims were stabbed to death and23 were teenagers- the highest number of such victims for more than a decade - figures collated by the BBC shows. ""Each one of these cases is a tragedy, not just for the victims, their families and friends, but also for our wider communities who are left reeling by these acts of senseless violence,"" a police spokesman said. ""Tackling violence is the number one priority for the Metropolitan Police Service. One homicide, one stabbing, one violent incident, is simply one too many."" Jaden Moodie, 14, was the youngest person to be killed in the capital, in 2019 Jaden Moodie,14, was the youngest person to be killed in the capital, in 2019. Ayoub Majdouline, 19 and from Wembley,was found guilty of his murder on Wednesday. Jodie was stabbed in the back in an unprovoked attack as she sat in a park in East London on 1 March Jodie Chesney, who was stabbed to death in east London, was another teenager to die this year. The 17-year-old was knifed in the back as she sat with friends in Harold Hill, on 1 March. Fatal teen stabbings in London at 11-year high Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and Arron Isaacs, 17, of Barking, were both convicted last month of her murder, following an eight-week trial at the Old Bailey. Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent These are undoubtedly worrying figures for Londoners - and for the Met. In spite of a huge amount of effort and resource, which has contributed to a decline in stabbings and gun crime over the past 12 months, overall violence, including cases of murder and manslaughter, is still on the rise. However, the number of killings is not at levels seen in the 1990s and early 2000s when there were usually upwards of 160 such deaths each year. And, compared with other cities, London remains relatively safe. For example, in New York, which has a slightly lower population than London's nine million, there has been more than double the number of murders - 298 by the beginning of December. Over recent years, the homicide rate (killings as a proportion of the population) has been higher in other large cities in Europe, such as Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, even though numerically there has been more in London. The figures provide some perspective, but of course, they are of no comfort to the loved ones of those who have died in the capital this year. Lib Peck, Director of the Violence Reduction Unit at City Hall, says the number of those aged in their 20s, who are injured by knives, is beginning to drop. ""We are really determined to route out the causes this terrible phenomenon and the importance is that we are really investing in preventative measures.""

New volcanic activity slows NZ recovery efforts,"Poisonous gases are believed to be coming from the volcanic vent New Zealand's White Island volcano is showing increased seismic activity, putting recovery efforts on hold. Authorities had hoped they would be able to retrieve the bodies of those left behind on the island, all of whom are presumed dead, on Wednesday. The exact death toll is unclear. Police say at least six people died, two of them since leaving the island, and nine are officially missing. Another 22 people are in intensive care with severe burns. One has been moved to Australia. Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption Can we predict volcanic eruptions? The volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted on Monday when dozens of tourists were on the island. ""I've spoken to many of those involved in the operation and they are very, very eager to get back there, they want to bring people's loved ones home,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters. Mother and daughter Julie and Jessica Richards, aged 47 and 20, are among the dead White Island is a popular tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. At least 47 visitors from around the world were on the volcano crater at the time of two explosions in quick succession. Police originally said  that of the 30 injured, 25 were in a critical condition while the other five were classed as stable but serious. White Island volcano: Why skin is being imported Mr Nash explained the injuries to the survivors were so severe that some of them were unable to identify themselves. ""There are a number of people in hospital who cannot communicate, they have significant burns not only to skin but internal organs,"" he told Radio New Zealand. ""We wish them the best but we're not out of the woods yet, of that there's no doubt."" Dr Peter Watson, chief medical officer at New Zealand's National Burns Unit, said an estimated 1.2m sq cm of replacement skin would be needed for the patients. An order has been placed from the US. Several patients would be transferred to Australia by the Australian Defence Force using an intensive-care acceptable aircraft in the next 24-48 hours, Dr Watson said. Analysis by James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent Donated skin is vital for helping to save the life of a major burns patient. Skin is our largest organ and its main job is keeping dangerous viruses and bacteria out. The damage caused by severe burns leaves patients at very high risk of infection. Donor skin is a short-term fix. It comes from dead organ donors - in the same way as hearts, kidneys and corneas - and can be banked for several years. The donor-skin aids healing, cuts the risk of infection and can reduce pain. The immune system is so weak after such an injury that rejection is not an issue. A single major burns patient needs a lot of donor skin. New Zealand is treating many at the same time and has needed to turn to other countries for help. New Zealand's chief coroner on Wednesday declared the eruption a ""mass fatality incident"". Officials said they are working with disaster specialists and forensic experts to identify the victims so their bodies can be returned to their families. There have been many tributes for the victims in the nearby port town New Zealand police have now listed nine people as officially missing,external- though they say this is a partial list as they have not been able to speak to all the next of kin. These are: Hayden Inman (New Zealand) Tipene Maangi (New Zealand) Julie Richards (Australia) Jessica Richards (Australia) Gavin Dallow (Australia) Zoe Hosking (Australia) Richard Elzer (Australia) Karla Matthews (Australia) Krystal Browitt (Australia) At least seven people on the list are believed to be dead or presumed dead, based on relatives talking to media. Tour guide Hayden Inman was identified as among the dead by his brother on Facebook. Julie Richards and her daughter Jessica from Brisbane, Australia, were identified as victims by a family spokesperson. In pictures: White Island eruption Adelaide father Gavin Dallow has been named as dead, with his stepdaughter Zoe Hosking presumed dead, according to media reports. Australian tourist Jason Griffiths, who was travelling with Karla Matthews and Richard Elzer, died in hospital on Wednesday. According to a statement released by their friends, both Karla and Richard are presumed dead. There is also a definitive list of all victims who are in hospital but police say they cannot release this for privacy reasons. This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" On Wednesday morning,geological agency GeoNet said,external""the level of volcanic tremor has significantly increased at the island"". Scientists view tremors, which result from a release of energy under the Earth's surface, as one sign of a possible eruption. In a later update, the agency said volcanic tremor, known as seismic activity,was now at the highest level seen since 2016,external. ""The level of volcanic tremor continues to rise and there is medium likelihood of future eruptive activity in the next 24 hours,"" the agency said. A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At a news conference on Wednesday, volcanologist Graham Leonard said seismic activity on White Island was escalating. ""Yesterday there was a high risk of an eruption,"" Mr Leonard said. ""Today there is an even higher risk of an eruption. And the parameters are worsening at the moment."" Police said the latest seismology update meant recovery teams had no choice but to wait, but they were on constant standby to return to the island as soon as possible. Police Minister Nash said there were also poisonous gases coming from the volcanic vent and that the island was blanketed in a thick layer of acidic ash. With measuring equipment on the island still intact, GeoNet can give regular updates on the situation, allowing police to assess the risk of sending recovery teams. Reconnaissance flights have shown no signs of life on the island and officials believe there are no survivors among the missing. Police said a drone conducted four fly-overs of the island on Wednesday, and analysis of that footage was ongoing. Are you in the area?

Men arrested and women rescued in 'brothel' raids,"Police said they had seen a recent ""dramatic rise"" in the off-street sex trade in the area Nine people have been arrested and 11 women rescued during raids at suspected brothels. Police raided 15 places on Tuesday night where they found Romanian and Hungarian women, in their 20s, believed to be victims of sexual exploitation. The searches, in Luton, were part of an investigation into human trafficking, exploitation and modern day slavery. The five men and four women are suspected of managing and controlling brothels, among other charges. They include six Romanians, one Hungarian and one Briton and are in custody at Luton police station. Five men and four women were arrested in the raids The raids were part of Operation Thame and the latest intelligence-led operation involved 150 police officers and specialist staff. Officers seized substantial amounts of cash and at one property three officers were attacked with pepper spray. The rescued women spoke little or no English and were taken to a place of safety. Police carried out simultaneous raids on 15 suspected brothels Insp Jim Goldsmith said some women are offered contracts to come to the UK to work in a proper job but ""unfortunately that's not the case"" and the raids were the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""We've seen quite a dramatic rise over the last eight to nine months in the off-street sex trade in Luton which has seen numerous brothels open and as such, has prompted the action we've taken. ""We try to keep these woman as safe as we can and that was the purpose of [these raids] to take the women out of that environment, give them the opportunity to exit that life and get them back to their families."" Man, aged in his 50s, held on suspicion of human trafficking One man and two women, aged in their 30s, arrested on suspicion of keeping a brothel One man and two women, aged in their 20s, held on suspicion of keeping a brothel One of the women aged in her 20s, is also held on suspicion of money laundering Man, aged in his 40s, arrested on suspicion of money laundering, possession of a firearm and assaulting an emergency worker Man, aged in his 40s, held on suspicion of possession of a firearm Bedfordshire Police Update provided as man, 49, is arrested along busy road in High Wycombe English GCSE exams may be 'first of many' to move onscreen in 2025 - what will it mean for students?

Who are the UK's three million tactical voters?,"The issue of tactical voting is looming large in discussions about how the 2019 general election will play out. Tactical voting happens when a voter abandons the party or candidate they prefer, and votes for one with a better chance of winning locally - often, but not always, in order to defeat a disliked candidate. Relatively small changes in the number of votes a candidate receives have the potential to make a big difference. At the 2017 election174 MPs were elected with less than half the vote,and in 2015it was 334 out of 650. In those constituencies, supporters of the parties that came third place or lower, could have defeated the MP by backing the second-placed party. Surveys after recent elections saw about one in 10 voters - around 3 million people - saying they voted tactically. The number of people voting tactically has not changed very much since the 1990s, despite the fact that peopleswitch votes between elections more frequently,external. It seems that tactical voting is not driven by political sophistication or general willingness to consider switching, so much as how much support there is for lower-placed candidates in constituencies, and how much supporters of those lower-placed candidates like their second-choice party and dislike one of the top contenders. Tactical voting is not particularly more likely to happen in closely fought constituencies, where a relatively small number of voters can make more of a difference. People often vote tactically in relatively safe seats too. Since it is not always clear what order the parties are going to come in, some voters make mistakes and vote tactically the wrong way - that is, for a party that ends up doing worse than the voter's preferred party. Typically though, people are more likely to vote tactically the clearer it is that their preferred party is out of contention. In the 1990s, after the Conservatives had been in power for over a decade, Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters were often willing to vote tactically for each other depending on who was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This reacheda high point in 1997,externalwhen tactical voting was estimated to have cost the Conservatives around 46 seats, with Labour taking 35 and the Liberal Democrats 11 of them. Tactical voting played a part in Tony Blair's 1997 election victory However, if tactical voting fails to happen in large enough numbers, it doesn't make a difference. At the 2015 election, shortly after the Scottish independence referendum, there was an attempt to co-ordinateanti-nationalist tactical voting,externalamong opponents of the Scottish National Party (SNP). It even involved Conservative supporters voting Labour. It almost certainly saved Labour from a total wipe-out in Scotland, securing their one remaining seat north of the border that year. But it was not enough to stop the SNP fromwinning nearly all the seats(56 out of 59) with just less than half the overall vote in Scotland. Tactical voting in the 2019 general election is likely to be shaped mainly by divisions over Brexit, even more so than it was in 2017. Among Leave supporters, tactical voting is likely to come into play in constituencies where the Brexit Party and the Conservatives are competing to take a seat from a party that is sympathetic to another referendum (the Brexit Party has alreadystood down its candidatesin seats that the Conservatives won last time). The Conservatives' message - ""get Brexit done"" - is aimed partly at encouraging Brexit Party supporters to use their vote tactically in seats where the Conservatives have a better chance of winning (that is, most, if not all, of them). Tactical voting among Remain supporters is much more complicated because it involves more parties, withvarying Brexit policies. The Lib Dems the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are all pro-Remain. The Labour Party is in favour of a referendum but has not committed to supporting Remain or Leave. Pro-Remain parties also disagree on other issues, and they do not always say nice things about each other's party leaders. For all of these reasons, many supporters of these parties are not keen on switching tactically in favour of one of the others. It is often difficult to identify Remain candidates best placed to win seats from Conservatives. This is because different pro-Remain parties did well in different places at the last general election. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? What's more, there have been big changes in the opinion polls since 2017. On average in the polls, the Labour vote has dropped by 10 percentage points since the last election, while the Lib Dem vote has increased by six points. This suggests the Lib Dems may have overtaken Labour in as many as 55 of the 273 seats where Conservatives are defending and Labour came second last time. At this and previous elections there have been constituency polls to guide people in some high profile places. Now there are also sophisticated statistical models of polling data attempting to show how support for the parties stands in every constituency. These models have been used by campaign groups to set up websites encouraging people to vote tactically for particular parties in particular constituencies. What is the secret behind tactical voting? Are ads and leaflets on tactical voting misleading people? Some go so far as to organise vote swapping - matching people from different constituencies so they can both vote tactically, knowing that someone somewhere else will be voting for their preferred party. Tactical voting websites largely agree on which pro-Remain parties are best placed to win in which constituencies, but they do not entirely agree. There have also been changes in public opinion since those websites were set up, and there might well be further changes before election day. And, of course, all polls and forecasts may be inaccurate. So tactical voting websites cannot be entirely relied on. Voters have to form their own judgements as to whom they want to vote for and why.

Will there be checks on goods entering NI?,"The claim:Boris Johnson said goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would only be checked if they are expected to be moved onwards into the Republic of Ireland. He told Sky News ""the only checks that there would be, would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland"". Reality Check verdict:Some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will have to be checked even if they are staying in Northern Ireland. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed in October means that Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. A Treasury documentleaked a few days agosuggested this would mean new checks on goods being traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For example, the EU has particularly strict rules on importing ""products of animal origin"" - that is to say meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks whether they are destined to remain there or be moved to the Republic of Ireland. The island of Ireland is already a single regulatory zone for animal health. This means that all livestock entering Northern Ireland from GB is currently checked at the point of entry. What is in Boris Johnson's new deal with the EU? Johnson insists no NI-GB goods checks post-Brexit A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments of meat and dairy product are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to get rid of checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market. The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely . What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a generation,"Greta Thunberg is one of the world's best-known climate change campaigners. She has been credited with raising public awareness, especially amongst young people Ms Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor. She first learned about climate change when she was eight. When she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante. ""She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,"" he said. Around the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. Greta at a 'school strike' in 2018. She was 15 when she began the protests In summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first ""School Strike for Climate"" outside the Swedish parliament. The protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined herFridays For Future strikes. Mr Thunberg says his daughter became ""much happier"" after she started campaigning. She has described her autism diagnosis as a ""superpower"" which helped motivate her protests. ""Being different is a gift,""she told the BBC. ""If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike."" Between 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders. She left school in summer 2023, andended her school climate strikes. Ms Thunberg has been arrested several times for her participation in environmental protests around the world and fined by the Swedish courts. Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' A really simple guide to climate change In April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunbergtold members of the European Parliament: ""Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not."" Five months later,she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York. ""I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,"" she told delegates. ""Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.""

What Greta Thunberg did with her year off school Ms Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023. In 2019, she became the youngest-everTime Person of the Year. Also in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women. In 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis. At the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter,by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their ""enormous emissions"",external. She respondedwith a sarcastic tweet,externalwhich was liked by several million people and shared widely. Donald Trump said it was ""ridiculous"" that Time magazine nominated Greta Thunberg as its person of the year She was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said:""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!"",external. Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a ""kind, but poorly informed, teenager"". Greta defends herself against trolls Hundreds of thousands of young people around the world joined the Fridays for Future strikes Although Ms Thunberg has not devised any specific environmental strategies, she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people.

'They try so desperately to silence us',"This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Swedish activist Greta Thunberg says young people are ""bringing change"" to the Madrid climate talks and will not be silenced. At a news conference Miss Thunberg said that she hoped the negotiations would yield ""something concrete"" The 16-year-old was mobbed by press and spectators when she visited the conference centre earlier on Friday. She had to be escorted away for her own safety amid shouts of ""leave her alone"" from concerned observers. Having arrived via overnight train from Lisbon to large crowds waiting for her in Madrid, Miss Thunberg was set to join a large demonstration in favour of rapid climate action this evening. Speaking before the gathering she said that the voices of the young would not be drowned out. ""People want everything to continue like now and they are afraid of change,"" she told reporters. ""And change is what we young people are bringing and that is why they want to silence us and that is just a proof that we are having an impact that our voices are being heard that they try so desperately to silence us."" This video can not be played Greta Thunberg was protected by police as she arrived in Madrid Miss Thunberg is due to address the climate negotiations that have been going on in Madrid for the past week. She remains hopeful that they will lead to a positive outcome. ""I sincerely hope that COP25 will lead to something concrete and it will lead to also to an increase in awareness in people in general and that the world leaders and people in power grab the urgency of the climate crisis because right now it  doesn't seem like they are,"" she said. ""We will do everything we can to show that this is something that cannot be ignored, that they cannot just hide away any longer."" Miss Thunberg has arrived in Europe after a voyage across the Atlantic by yacht. Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' Greta Thunberg: People underestimate 'angry kids' Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid The hope among many here is that the scale of the march and her speech to the COP next week will give a big boost to the talks process that seem badly in need of a lift. This COP started with great hope last Monday, with strong words from the UN secretary-general and others,warning that time is running outand that negotiators should be guided by the science. Since then, the urgency has given way to frustration. Little obvious progress is being made on the central question of raising countries' ambitions to cut carbon. Indeed, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the issue of increased pledges wasn't even on the agenda for the final outcome of this conference. ""We don't have in the agenda one item that's called 'ambition' and, therefore, it's not like we are expecting to have a specific decision on that."" In the face of several recent scientific reports stating that countries were falling further behind when it came to meeting the Paris agreement targets, this was a little disturbing, to say the least. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa According to some experts at these talks, extra ambition would be great but equally important would be a firm timetable to deliver their pledges over the next 12 months, ahead of the Glasgow COP this time next year. Right now, that's not certain. ""It would be extremely concerning if the countries here in Madrid did not agree that there is a timeline for next year in coming forward with their commitments,"" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. ""That is a key outcome that we have to see here. It is not something that you can keep punting further and further away, this is something that requires immediate action."" Even the Pope is concerned. ""We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change,"" Pope Francis said in a message to participants here. Much of what happens in Madrid could be governed by what happens in Brussels next week where aEuropean Green Deal,externalis set to be outlined by the incoming EU Commission. ""What the European Union does next week is a critical signal to the rest of the world that will shape the outcome in Madrid,"" said David Waskow. ""What happens in Brussels will resonate in Madrid."" Protestors at the COP showed the continuing influence of coal on the climate Another ongoing issue that is making people upset here is the question of climate justice. Much attention has been focussed on the attempts by poorer countries to finally get some traction around the question of loss and damage, the impacts of climate change from events that just can't be adapted to, such as sea-level rise or storms made more likely by rising temperatures. The hope from many is that here in Madrid, the developing nations would be heard and a mechanism with funding would be set up to deal with loss and damage. Again, there's been very little progress. Of course the question of climate justice is not just between countries but often within countries as well. ""The ones who contributed the most are the ones who feel the impacts the least,"" said Isadora Cardoso from campaign groupGenderCC - women for climate justice,external. ""Even within developed countries the poorest are the most affected whenever there are climate disasters or impacts, but they are not the ones who consume more and contribute the most to the causes of climate change."" There is still time to ensure a strong outcome in Madrid and the arrival of ministers next week will increase the sense of urgency - but right now there's a big disconnect between the size of the task and the willingness of countries to step forward with the pledges and the money needed to deal with the biggest challenge facing Planet Earth.

Thunberg accuses world leaders of 'creative PR',"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg criticised CEOs and politicians for their lack of action Greta Thunberg, the Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a global movement to fight climate change, has been named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. The 16-year-old is the youngest person to be chosen by the magazine in a tradition that started in 1927. Speaking at a UN climate change summit in Madrid before the announcement, she urged world leaders to stop using ""creative PR"" to avoid real action. The next decade would define the planet's future, she said. Last year, the teenager started an environmental strike by missing lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. It sparked a worldwide movement that became popular with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. Since then, she has become a strong voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. Earlier this year, she wasnominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is Greta Thunberg? Island nation's 'fight to death' What is climate change? Where we are in seven charts At the UN Climate Conference in New York in September, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. In a now-famous speech, she said: ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We'll be watching you."" Reacting to the nomination on Twitter,external, the activist said: ""Wow, this is unbelievable! I share this great honour with everyone in the #FridaysForFuture movement and climate activists everywhere."" Time magazine's cover for its Person of the Year edition The teenager's message, however, has not been well received by everyone, most notably prominent conservative voices. Before her appearance in Madrid, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro called her a ""brat"" after she expressed concern about the killing of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. ""Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,"" Mr Bolsonaro told reporters. ""It's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,"" he said, using the Portuguese word for brat, ""pirralha"". The activist responded by briefly changing her Twitter bio to ""Pirralha"". She has previously been at odds with US President Donald Trump, who has questioned climate science and rolled back many US climate laws, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who once called her a ""kind but poorly informed teenager"". This video can not be played Greta at UN climate change talks - one year apart Announcing Time's decision on NBC, editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said: ""She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement."" The magazine's tradition, which started as Man of the Year, recognises the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"". Last year, it named murdered and imprisoned journalists, calling them ""The Guardians"". At the COP25 Climate Conference in Madrid, Greta Thunberg accused world powers of making constant attempts ""to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition"". ""The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when, in fact, almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" she said, drawing applause. ""In just three weeks we'll enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future,"" she added. ""Right now, we're desperate for any sign of hope."" This was meant to be a big moment in the talks, the elixir of the ""Greta effect"" bringing new energy to a flagging process.  The teenager is almost certainly the most famous person here, attracting far more attention than other celebrities like Al Gore, and the UN badly needs a boost. Her talk came over as measured, grounded in the latest research, and avoided the flash of hurt and anger she displayed in New York in September. Looking around the hall, it was striking how many of the national delegations had not turned up for this morning session at the conference. A snub by the big fossil fuel economies? Or maybe they were too busy in the negotiations themselves? In any event, the passion among the millions of young people who have taken to the streets to demand action on climate change feels very remote from the diplomatic struggles in these halls. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission - the EU executive - announced ambitious environmental proposals to cut the bloc's dependency on fossil fuels, hoping to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on 1 December, called theEuropean Green Deal,externalEurope's ""man on the Moon moment"". It includes proposals that affect everything from transport and buildings to food production, and air and water pollution. The package will be debated by EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and includes: A â¬100bn (Â£84bn; $110bn) mechanism to help countries still heavily dependent on fossil fuels to transition to renewable energy sources Proposals to tighten the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for 2030 A law that will set the EU ""onto an irreversible path to climate neutrality"" by 2050 A plan to promote a more circular economy - a system designed to eliminate waste - that will address more sustainable products as well as a ""farm to fork"" strategy to improve the sustainability of food production and distribution Reacting to the proposals, Jagoda Munic, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe, said they were ""too small, too few and too far off"", adding: ""We're on a runaway train to ecological and climate collapse and the EU Commission is gently switching gears instead of slamming on the brakes.""

Investigating a 'genocide',"About 725,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar over the past 12 months, many for Bangladesh Indiscriminate killing; villages burned to the ground; children assaulted; women gang-raped - these are the findings of United Nations investigators who allege that ""the gravest crimes under international law"" were committed in Myanmar last August. Such was their severity, the report said, the army must be investigated for genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine state. The investigators' conclusions came despite them not being granted access to Myanmar by the government there,which has since rejected the report. This is how the investigators came to their conclusions. On 24 March 2017, the UN Human Rights Council agreed to form an independent fact-finding mission on Myanmar to look into ""alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces"". Five months after the mission was formed, Myanmar's army launched a major assault on Rakhine state, following deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts. The military's campaign became the main focus of the investigation, which also looked into rights abuses in Kachin and Shan states. The mission wrote to Myanmar's government three times asking for access to the country. It received no response. ""The first rule was 'do no harm',"" says Christopher Sidoti, one of the three people who headed the investigation. ""Those people we spoke to had been heavily traumatised, and if our staff considered that an interview would be re-traumatising, it wouldn't have been conducted. ""No evidence is so important that it warrants re-traumatising someone who has gone through all these experiences."" What next for Myanmar after damning report? At least 725,000 people have fled Rakhine state over the past 12 months, many to neighbouring Bangladesh. As a result, despite not getting access to Myanmar, investigators were able to gather a vast amount of testimony from people who had experienced violence at first-hand before fleeing. Many made the treacherous journey from Rakhine to Bangladesh by sea They spoke to 875 people in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the UK, and made a decision early on that the most valuable testimony would come from people who had not shared their stories before. Seeing through the official story in Myanmar ""We didn't want to interview people who had been interviewed by other organisations,"" Mr Sidoti, an Australian human rights law expert, says. ""We didn't want a situation where people's evidence could have been tainted. ""We tried to get people from a wide variety of areas and when we became more and more focused later on, we would deliberately, through a community network, seek out others from that area to get a better picture of what went on."" ""We would never use just one account as proof,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""We always sought corroboration from primary and secondary sources."" Those sources included videos, photographs, documents and satellite images, which showed the destruction of Rohingya villages over several months in 2017. In one case, investigators had received several reports from refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, that a village had been destroyed in particular circumstances at a particular time. Investigators were then able to source satellite images that corroborated what witnesses had said. Satellites images showed that: About 392 villages were partially or totally destroyed in northern Rakhine state Close to 40% of all homes in the area - 37,700 buildings - were affected About 80% were burned in the first three weeks of the military campaign This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women Getting hold of photographic evidence from the ground proved to be more of a challenge. ""When people were leaving Rakhine state, they were being stopped, searched and deprived of their money, gold and mobile phones,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""It seemed pretty clear this was an attempt to get video or photographic evidence they had recorded. ""There wasn't much left but we made use of it."" UN says military leaders must face genocide charges Myanmar rejects UN accusation of 'genocide' The report names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and his deputy. How were investigators able to point the finger directly at these men? The case here is not based on a paper trail, or a recording, but instead on research. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Investigators relied heavily on others' detailed understanding of how Myanmar's government works. Among them was a military adviser who had co-operated with war crimes tribunals in the past. ""We have been able to access extraordinary international advice on various aspects of Myanmar's military,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""The conclusion we have come up with is that the army is so tightly controlled that nothing happens involving the army in Myanmar without the commander-in-chief and his deputies knowing."" While the people believed to have given the orders have been named, work is ongoing to identify the members of the military who may have committed atrocities. ""We do have a list of alleged perpetrators on the ground and they will remain confidential for now,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""Their names have come up frequently enough for them to be put on lists to face more investigation."" Identifying what appears to be genocide and proving that what happened fits the legal definition of genocide are two different things. ""Evidence of crimes against humanity was very quickly obtained and was quite overwhelming,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""Genocide is a much more legally complex issue."" Christopher Sidoti: ""None of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was"" As the report states, genocide is when ""a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". The key word is ""intent"". Investigators believe the evidence of that intent by the Myanmar army is clear. Could Suu Kyi face genocide charges? Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefully They cite statements by commanders and suspected perpetrators, and the degree of planning required to carry out such an operation. But still, identifying a genocide from a legal perspective took a significant amount of legal work. ""We arrived at a position we had not expected to be in when we were beginning,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""None of the three of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was. That came as a surprise."" The report says that the six military officials should face trial. It also condemns Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to intervene to stop attacks, and the UN's outgoing rights chief this week said she should have resigned as a result. The report also makes a series of recommendations, including the referral of the investigation to the International Criminal Court or to a new tribunal, and the imposition of an arms embargo. However, China has so far resisted strong action against its neighbour and ally Myanmar on the UN Security Council, where it holds a veto. Mr Sidoti acknowledges that officials in Myanmar are unlikely to investigate the allegations themselves. Last year, an internal investigation by the army exonerated itself of blame in the Rohingya crisis, and Myanmar's Permanent Representative to the UN last week told BBC Burmese the report was full of ""one-sided accusations against us"". ""We have made recommendations and it is up to others to act on them,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""I have a high expectation that the Security Council will act on its responsibilities. But I'm not naive.""

What are the key election issues for voters?BBC Wales' correspondents share their views on the policies that could make a difference.Election 2019,"The clock is ticking towards decision time - Wednesday is the last full day of campaigning before voters go to the polls in the general election. But what remain the key battlegrounds in December 2019 - especially for those still undecided? BBC Wales' correspondents take one last look at some of the policies that could make all the difference come Thursday. All parties would increase police officer numbers - putting them back to roughly where we were in 2010 - give or take. Lots of talk too of investing in youth services, from the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Plaid, to prevent them being drawn into a life of crime. While the Conservatives focus on tougher sentencing policies, particularly for the more serious crimes, Labour, Lib Dems and Plaid look at the other end of the scale and want to reduce the numbers going to prison for less serious offences, by doing away with short sentences. Conservatives would ramp up stop and search, Labour and Lib Dems would curb it. A fair bit of consensus here - Labour and Plaid talk of harm reduction rather than criminalising drug use, likewise the Lib Dems wouldn't jail those caught with drugs for personal use. The Conservatives aren't that specific here, but say they'd reduce drug deaths and break the links between addiction and crime. A necessary part of the belt-tightening caused by the financial crash or proof the poorest have borne the burden of ideologically-motivated austerity? Welfare reform has split British politics. The UK government spends Â£10bn a year on benefits in Wales, about half of which goes towards the state pension. Conservative-led governments have tried to simultaneously cut the bill and modernise a fiendishly complex system. Universal Credit was their answer. It replaces six benefits with a single monthly payment. If the Tories win, it will roll on. But their manifesto implicitly acknowledges criticism of the policy, promising to ""do more to make sure that UC works for the most vulnerable"". It also promises to reduce reassessments for disabled people and end a freeze on benefits - both of which have been attacked from the left for being cruel. What's Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Struggling to cope - Universal Credit in Wales Labour says the problems are so bad that tweaking things isn't enough. Universal Credit would be scrapped by Labour, but their manifesto isn't entirely clear on what will replace it or what would happen to the more than 130,000 people in Wales already receiving it. It's possible Labour would eventually introduce a similar system - albeit a more generous and, Labour would say, more compassionate one. Plaid Cymru's answer is to devolve a whole set of benefits. They accuse the Tories of dragging more people into poverty and Labour's Welsh Government of failing to protect the vulnerable. But as a recent inquiry by assembly members pointed out, devolving powers doesn't necessarily mean people will be better off. In their coalition with the Tories, the Liberal Democrats helped launch the era of austerity, but they blame the Conservatives for the design of Universal Credit. There's very little mention of Universal Credit in their manifesto, beyond promises to reform the way it works. The Brexit Party, meanwhile, says Universal Credit should be reviewed - an offer pitched at Labour's Leave-voting heartlands. Countless opinion polls show health and the NHS to be towards the top of the list people's priorities in any election so even though health is devolved - meaning the Welsh Government is in charge of it here - and nobody standing in this election will end up in charge of the Welsh NHS - it is inescapable as an issue. Whoever forms the next UK government will have to decide on how much money to give the NHS in England. The more money Westminster allocates to the NHS, and other public services such as schools and councils, in England - the more money will come to the Welsh Government's coffers. Analysis by BBC Wales suggests there's a substantial difference in the degree Wales would benefit as a result of the UK manifesto commitments of the main parties. But ultimately it'll be up to the Welsh Government how exactly to spend the extra cash. Health on the election trail in Wales 11 charts on why health matters in this vote The NHS has also featured prominently in the campaign as politicians want to try to convince people it would be safer in their hands. They want voters to trust them and distrust their opponents. That's why pictures of children lying on hospital floors or debates about any impact of future trade deals on NHS resonate. But the truth is the NHS is under a huge amount of pressure in all four nations of the UK and performance on targets to varying degrees have deteriorated in each over the course of the past 10 years or so. Though education is devolved, in many ways this UK election will have a significant impact on universities in Wales. Brexit is the big issue for higher education, and especially what replaces European funding and schemes such as Erasmus+. How Wales works: Devolution and universities Election education questions answered,external Decisions on tuition fees and student finance are taken by the Welsh Government but in this area any dramatic reforms in England are likely to prompt changes in Wales too. If tuition fees are scrapped, as some parties are promising, it would have a direct impact on thousands of Welsh students who study in English universities. And practically and politically it would be difficult for Welsh institutions to keep charging Â£9,000 if higher education cost less or was even free over the border. Brexit is the main issue facing business in Wales. 61% of Welsh exports go to the European Union, with 14% being sold to the USA and almost 17% to the rest of the world. The major parties are offering clearly different approaches to Brexit. There's the current deal, a renegotiation, another referendum, leaving without a deal or revoking Article 50 and not leaving the EU at all. Organising how we leave the EU is only one part of the Brexit process. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The future trading relationship, which still has to be negotiated, is crucial for Welsh business. It's not just about tariffs, there are other barriers to trade such as regulations - which companies will want to be kept to a minimum in order to keep sales and movement of goods flowing as smoothly as possible. Brexit supporters campaigned on the opportunities for trading with the rest of the world after leaving the EU. But there have been concerns over what a US trade deal may mean, including for food standards and NHS drug prices. What's agreed in one trade deal will likely have an impact on what can be agreed in others. The parties are also offering different approaches to immigration if freedom of movement from the EU comes to an end. Companies have been concerned that any changes shouldn't hamper the flexibility they want to allow people to come to Wales to tackle skill shortages. Increased public spending has been a theme that's run through the parties' promises. Where they differ is on the levels of spending and on what - capital spending on infrastructure - or day-to-day spending on services. They also would adopt varying levels of borrowing. What to look out for on the economy Challenges for the UK's economy What the parties are not doing is arguing that austerity should continue. Investing in green industries is proposed by parties as a way of reducing our carbon use, combating climate change and trying to kick-start sluggish economic growth at the same time. What they mean in detail ranges from insulating homes, encouraging electric vehicles, innovative ways of using technology to reduce carbon use and planting millions of trees. The new fee will come into effect on 1 April Funding for the arts and culture are devolved issues, but responsibility for broadcasting is retained by Westminster. There is a consensus among the party manifestos that free TV licences should continue to be provided for the over-75s, reversing a decision announced by the BBC in June 2019. The Brexit Party takes this further, stating it would phase out the licence fee altogether. Some of the most notable interventions in media policy have come on the campaign trail, rather than in party manifestos. Boris Johnson questioned how much longer the TV licence fee could be ""justified"", while Conservative sources briefed some journalists that ""if we are re-elected, we will have to review Channel 4's Public Service Broadcasting obligations"". What happens with Brexit will impact the Welsh environment in all sorts of ways. But let's focus on one of the key issues - funding for farmers, who manage more than 80% of our landscape. EU subsidies make up a large part of their incomes at the moment. There have already been a series of Welsh Government consultations on proposed new payment schemes. But the big unknown is how much money will be handed over from Westminster to Wales to make them work if we leave. During the election campaign the Conservatives have pledged to guarantee funding at the same level as now until 2024, Labour and the Brexit Party say they'll also maintain subsidies and grants for farmers. The Lib Dems and Green Party want to cancel Brexit, but say they favour reducing payments to larger farms to give more money for supporting the environment. Plaid Cymru also want to stay in the EU, but say direct subsidy payments must be maintained if we leave. The parties are talking much more about green issues in general at this election. Perhaps the area that will have the biggest impact on Wales is how quickly they want to end the UK's contribution to global warming by reaching effectively a 100% cut in greenhouse gas emissions.

LiveLiveFinal day on the campaign trail,"It's the final day of campaigning, ahead of Thursday's general election Jeremy Corbyn works his way through six constituencies offering a ""vote for hope"" and attacking Tory ""negativity"" Boris Johnson travels from West Yorkshire, through Wales and to London, insisting the Tories are the only party who can ""get Brexit done"" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also tours Remain-supporting seats, urging voters to back her candidates to stop Brexit The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon makes her final pitch in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dunbartonshire Nigel Farage reaches out to Labour Leave voters and warns of the holes in Mr Johnson's Brexit deal Plaid Cymru and the Greens also drive home their key messages Polls will open at 07:00 GMT on Thursday and close at 22:00 Chris Lansdown, Dulcie Lee, Jennifer Scott and Paul Seddon This video can not be played Well, that was the last day of the 2019 election campaign. So what happened?  If you're still not sure who to vote for, check out our manifesto comparison tool here. Things will look a little different tomorrow, as we're subject to strict restrictions on what we can publish while polls are open. Thanks for joining us here on the live page throughout this election campaign. We'll be back with you all through tomorrow, into the night and throughout Friday. See you then. There's only one place to be tomorrow night - and that's here on the BBC. Here's how to follow our coverage: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The main messages of the leaders are clear. But beyond two separate ardent cores, they can struggle to convince even everyone on their own side. The wider public's mantra is not ""get Brexit done"" or ""it's time for real change"", but perhaps instead ""we're not convinced by any of you"". But this election has not been an exercise in enthusiasm - there is a sense that the politicians available may not be the ones to answer convincingly the questions they have set. Making his final pitch to voters, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says: ""Nine years ago, the Tories and Lib Dems got together and decided that they would go down the road of austerity - a political choice. ""A political choice to cut spending to local government, a political choice to freeze welfare spending, a political choice to freeze public sector wages, a political choice to underfund the National Health Service, a political choice to treble university fees, a political choice to impose poverty on the already poorest people in the country. ""They did all that knowing what the consequences would be. ""So when the election comes tomorrow, it is a very clear choice. You go down the road of Boris Johnson: a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump, you break off any serious relationship with Europe,"" he continues. ""Or you go down the Labour way, the adult, responsible way of negotiating a settlement that we will all live by and I will make sure is carried out in a future relationship with Europe. ""But we also go down the road of investing in our country, investing to end austerity, and re-distributing wealth and power in our society in a way that's never been seen before by any government in Britain."" Jeremy Corbyn, speaking in east London at his last campaign event of the day, says: ""Tomorrow we're our knocking on doors like our life depends on it, as the lives of many do."" He recounts enthusiastic Labour events around the country ""in the big city, the small places"", adding: ""You wouldn't know it from much of the media reporting of the election. It's commentators speculating on other commentators."" He interrupts shouting from the audience by saying: ""No, no, no, we believe in a free press, I just wish they'd free themselves from the shackles of the billionaires."" It's your favourite politics podcast, back with its final episode before the country heads to the polls. Tune in for gossip on:  Listen to it here on BBC Sounds. Exit poll, hung parliament, swing, turnout. In the next day or two, you could be hearing these words a lot. Do you know what they all mean? Head over to our election translator, where we explain all the terms you need to know. Listing his Conservative Party's manifesto pledges, Boris Johnson continues with a promise of ""50,000 new nurses... 50,000 more nurses I should sayâ¦ while the BBC are checking it."" Indeed we are Mr Johnson. He is of course referencing his party's pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. As our health editor Hugh Pympreviously explained: ""It is not right to say that the Conservatives plan to recruit 50,000 more nurses or find 50,000 new nurses."" That's because of that number, 31,500 would be new nurses (19,000 newly-trained recruits and 12,500 overseas recruits). But the remaining 18,500 would be existing nurses persuaded not to quit, or to come back. Speaking at the Tories' final campaign rally in London, Boris Johnson tells party supporters they have a ""national duty to find every vote to save our country from disaster"". The Conservative leader says the race is ""tight and getting tighter,"" adding that a vote for any other party could lead to a hung Parliament and ""economic disaster"". He adds that Jeremy Corbyn would hold another referendum on the EU, while the Tories would - as we've heard him say many, many times in recent weeks - ""get Brexit done"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove has just taken to the stage at a rally in east London, where Boris Johnson is expected to speak soon. ""Well friends. This is it. The moment of truth,"" Mr Gove begins. He goes on to attack the other party leaders. ""On anti-Semitism, on national security, on the economy, on Brexit, on every issue of importance to this country, Jeremy Corbyn gets it wrong,"" he says, describing him as an ""apology of a leader"". Moving on to talk about SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""She doesn't love this country, she wants to tear it in two. So again, let the message go out from this hall, we say 'Nicola, hands off our precious United Kingdom'."" ""As for Jo Swinson, the leader of the party that calls itself the Liberal Democrats,"" he continues. ""She wants to take the biggest democratic vote in this country, the proposition that we should leave the European Union and cancel it outright. She's neither liberal, nor democratic."" Mr Corbyn haspreviously saidanti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. What is this election for? How does voting work?

The Conservatives have told the Andrew Neil Show they do not want to put anyone up for interview the night before the election. So instead, Neil is interviewing former deputy prime minister Lord Michael Heseltine - who has made his Remain beliefs very clear during the campaign. Asked if Boris Johnson is fit to be prime minister, he says he has ""avoided discussion about personality issues"" in the run-up to the election as ""great issues become slanging matches"". But Lord Heseltine says the ""overarching"" issue of the campaign has been Brexit. He says there needs to be a coalition ""for one reason only"" and that is to get another referendum on Brexit ""now that the issues are clearer than they were three years ago"". However, he doesn't want Jeremy Corbyn to lead it. Lord Heseltine says Labour is ""itching to get rid"" of Mr Corbyn, and there were many moderates who could take his place. ""We are facing a period of prolonged uncertainty,"" he adds. ""There is no way of getting Brexit done in a matter of weeks or months. ""The alternative is we have a no overall control Parliament, out of which comes a short-term coalition for the one purpose of another referendum. ""There would be delay, yes, but much shorter delay than the anxiety and uncertainty of going through with Brexit."" Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib is next up in the chair on The Andrew Neil Show. He criticises Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, saying the PM had ""piveted"" back to closer alignment with the EU, and away from what had won over his party. As a result, Nigel Farage's decision to stand down in Tory-held seats may have been a mistake. ""With the benefit of hindsight, we would not have pulled out of so many seats,"" he says. ""With the benefit of hindsight, and given where the prime minister is going, we probably shouldn't have pulled out of all those seats."" However, Mr Habib denies the campaign has been a ""shambles"", and says the Brexit Party has a ""really, really good chance in a number of seats in the Midlands, the north and Wales"" - even if he admits the campaign ""could have gone better"". Now Andrew Neil talks to Prof Sir John Curtice - our polling expert - ahead of tomorrow's vote. Prof Sir John says the ""principle story"" of the election has been that it remains a two-party fight in England and Wales. He explains that the Tories gained five points in the polls over the campaign, but Labour did the same. ""The result of which is, the Conservatives have maintained their lead of 10 points."" Prof Sir John says the Tories squeezed the votes of the Brexit Party, while Labour squeezed those of the Lib Dems. And what does that show? ""This country is still divided more or less down the middle on whether it wants to leave the EU or stay,"" he adds. Andrew Neil lists some of the other policies, including banning gas heating and cutting flights. He then asks the Green's co-leader what the point was of causing ""pain"" to people if China continues to pump carbon into the air? Sian Berry says: ""There is a climate emergency, the children are on the streets around the entire globe. ""You cannot argue the UK shouldn't [act]."" She adds: ""China needs to come on board with the same reductions. ""What's your argument, that we should not bother? That we should not be the climate leaders? ""It is not pain - we are talking about building a better Britain."" The next interviewee on The Andrew Neil Show is the Green Party's co-leader Sian Berry. She says her party has been ""leading the agenda"" and pushing other parties to tackle climate change. Neil questions whether the plans the Greens have - spending Â£100bn a year to cut emissions by 2030 - line up with comments by experts. But Ms Berry says her party wants to ensure the planet doesn't ""tip into runaway climate change"" that cannot be reversed. ""[Our plans] are about changing the whole system really dramatically and investing in decarbonisation,"" she adds. Finally, Neil questions the shadow transport secretary on accusations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Asked whether he has read the report by the Jewish Labour movement, Mr McDonald says he hasn't seen it all, but feels ""incredibly saddened"" by the incidents. ""But equally I feel absolutely determined as a member of shadow cabinet... to root this out and Jeremy Corbyn is committed to this cause"". Mr McDonald also says Mr Corbyn has ""made strides ever since he became leader"", and wants to see anti-Semitism ""tackled in wider society"". Andrew Neil says the percentage difference between the Tories' and Labour's plans on spending for the NHS were tiny, and to say the NHS was at risk was ""scaremongering"". But Andy McDonald says the presenter should ""look at the record"". ""Look at cancelling nursing bursaries,"" he says. ""What a ridiculous thing to do when we need nurses in the NHS."" Mr McDonald says ""every step is counter intuitive"" by the Conservatives, adding: ""That's why we need the change."" The Andrew Neil Show is on BBC Two for an hour-long special right now. The presenter says the last week of campaigning has been full of ""fervour, fury and even the odd climbdown"". Neil also doesn't let it pass without mention thatBoris Johnson never did sit down with him for a prime time interview... But moving on, he asks shadow transport secretary Andy McDonaldabout the embarrassment caused by his colleague, Jon Ashworth, this week, when a leaked conversation saw the shadow health secretary casting doubt on Labour's chance's tomorrow. Mr McDonald says it was a ""friendly conversation"" and ""banter"" with someone he thought was a friend, not Mr Ashworth's views. ""It leads us to conclude you shouldn't trust a Tory,"" he says. But Mr McDonald does admit he would have been a ""little more cautious"" and ""wouldn't have the confidence to have that banter"" without expecting someone to misinterpret it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Can you take a selfie at a polling station?Who are the UK's three million tactical voters?Where do the parties stand on Brexit?Suu Kyi rejects genocide claims at top UN court,"This video can not be played BBC reporter Chi Chi Izundu explains what you can and can't do in the polling station on election day The general election takes place on Thursday, but what do you need to know about polling station etiquette? Here are the rules on everything from whether you can take a selfie to voting while drunk. Thedeadline for registering to votein this general election was on 26 November. If you are on the electoral register, you should have received a polling card with your polling number and polling station address. If you do not have a polling cardcontact your local authority's election office.,external You must vote at the polling station to which you have been assigned between 07:00 and 22:00 GMT on election day. If you are in a queue when the polls shut, you will be allowed to vote. This video can not be played How does a general election actually work? When you arrive, staff will take your details and in Northern Ireland, they will also request a form of photographic ID. You don't need your polling card, although it may speed things up. You will receive a ballot paper, featuring an official mark or number to combat fraud, and listing candidates and parties in your constituency. Take it to a screened booth, where you will find a pencil to vote with, although you can use your own pen if you prefer. Read the ballot paper carefully and then vote for your chosen candidate by putting an X in the box by their name. If you mark any more boxes, your paper will be invalid. However, if you make a mistake you can get another ballot paper, if you have not put it in the ballot box. Votes made with a tick or even a smiley facemay be counted if the voter's choice is clear,,externalbut will be disqualified otherwise. When you are ready, fold the ballot paper - for privacy - and put it in the box where the votes are collected. The Electoral Commission advises against it because it risks accidentally giving away how someone else voted, which is against the law. However, it adds that people are welcome to share photos taken outside a polling station ""to encourage your friends and family to vote"". Yes you can - but only about your vote and not anyone else's, so you are advised not to update your account inside the polling station. The punishment for revealing how another person voted - even accidentally - is up to Â£5,000, or six months in prison. You are not allowed to photograph the ballot paper you receive in a polling station - but you can snap your postal ballot paper, because electoral law treats them differently. Yes. Some people spoil their votes as a protest vote. These do not count towards any candidate, but are recorded. Only0.2% of votes were rejected,externalfor being invalid at the 2017 general election. Animals, apart from assistance dogs, are not usually allowed inside polling stations. The Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent you from wearing a slogan going into a polling station, with the intention of voting. You should, however, leave immediately afterwards as campaigning inside polling stations is not permitted, and this could be seen as doing just that. Yes. You can vote if you are drunk or under the influence of drugs, unless you are disruptive. POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external Yes - as long as you registered to vote by post, or appointed a proxy to vote on your behalf, in time. Before you go to vote - yes. Inside the polling station - definitely not, as political discussion is banned there. Staff will intervene if they hear any chat about candidates or parties. Yes they can, if they are registered to vote at your polling station, but they cannot enter the booth where you vote. If the friend is not registered there, they may be refused entry. This is up to polling station staff. Yes. Bringing children to the polling station is encouraged, because it is seen as educating them about democracy. But a child is not allowed to mark your vote on the ballot paper. Yes. The presiding officer can mark the paper for you, or a close family member aged 18 or over, or another eligible voter, like a support worker, can accompany you. If you have a visual impairment, you can ask for a device that lets you mark your own ballot paper. A large print version should also be available. This video can not be played Nikki Fox on the hurdles and options for disabled voters Polling stations are selected for accessibility. If a voter cannot enter the polling station because of a physical disability, the presiding officer may take the ballot paper to them. For help, call the Electoral Commission on 0333 103 1928. A dedicated helpline - 020 7696 6009 - for anyone with a learning disability, their families and carers, and polling station staff, has also been set up by Mencap. You can, but it may mean your vote won't be counted. If you wish to vote for a candidate you should avoid writing comments in the margin. It might confuse the counters and lead to your vote being deemed doubtful and subsequently rejected. People do occasionally sign their ballots, but if the name is identifiable then again your vote will not count. No. It is entirely up to you whether or not you vote. The average turnout in the UK for general elections since 1918 has been 72.9%. We can't tell you - we are the BBC and have strict impartiality rules - but if you want to read around, here's a link to ourparty guidesandour manifesto guide. Some people choose to vote tactically in an election -this is what that means. Staff are recruited by local councils. Jobs available include being the presiding officer, conducting the ballot, counting the votes and processing the postal votes. These roles are paid at different rates, with some councils offering more than Â£300 for certain positions. The votes will start to be counted as soon as the polls close. Constituencies will start to declare their results within the first few hours of the vote. A large number are expected between 03:00 and 05:00 GMT on Friday. It is difficult to predict when a new government will be formed, and it depends on how close the election is.

Who are the UK's three million tactical voters?Where do the parties stand on Brexit?Suu Kyi rejects genocide claims at top UN court,"The issue of tactical voting is looming large in discussions about how the 2019 general election will play out. Tactical voting happens when a voter abandons the party or candidate they prefer, and votes for one with a better chance of winning locally - often, but not always, in order to defeat a disliked candidate. Relatively small changes in the number of votes a candidate receives have the potential to make a big difference. At the 2017 election174 MPs were elected with less than half the vote,and in 2015it was 334 out of 650. In those constituencies, supporters of the parties that came third place or lower, could have defeated the MP by backing the second-placed party. Surveys after recent elections saw about one in 10 voters - around 3 million people - saying they voted tactically. The number of people voting tactically has not changed very much since the 1990s, despite the fact that peopleswitch votes between elections more frequently,external. It seems that tactical voting is not driven by political sophistication or general willingness to consider switching, so much as how much support there is for lower-placed candidates in constituencies, and how much supporters of those lower-placed candidates like their second-choice party and dislike one of the top contenders. Tactical voting is not particularly more likely to happen in closely fought constituencies, where a relatively small number of voters can make more of a difference. People often vote tactically in relatively safe seats too. Since it is not always clear what order the parties are going to come in, some voters make mistakes and vote tactically the wrong way - that is, for a party that ends up doing worse than the voter's preferred party. Typically though, people are more likely to vote tactically the clearer it is that their preferred party is out of contention. In the 1990s, after the Conservatives had been in power for over a decade, Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters were often willing to vote tactically for each other depending on who was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This reacheda high point in 1997,externalwhen tactical voting was estimated to have cost the Conservatives around 46 seats, with Labour taking 35 and the Liberal Democrats 11 of them. Tactical voting played a part in Tony Blair's 1997 election victory However, if tactical voting fails to happen in large enough numbers, it doesn't make a difference. At the 2015 election, shortly after the Scottish independence referendum, there was an attempt to co-ordinateanti-nationalist tactical voting,externalamong opponents of the Scottish National Party (SNP). It even involved Conservative supporters voting Labour. It almost certainly saved Labour from a total wipe-out in Scotland, securing their one remaining seat north of the border that year. But it was not enough to stop the SNP fromwinning nearly all the seats(56 out of 59) with just less than half the overall vote in Scotland. Tactical voting in the 2019 general election is likely to be shaped mainly by divisions over Brexit, even more so than it was in 2017. Among Leave supporters, tactical voting is likely to come into play in constituencies where the Brexit Party and the Conservatives are competing to take a seat from a party that is sympathetic to another referendum (the Brexit Party has alreadystood down its candidatesin seats that the Conservatives won last time). The Conservatives' message - ""get Brexit done"" - is aimed partly at encouraging Brexit Party supporters to use their vote tactically in seats where the Conservatives have a better chance of winning (that is, most, if not all, of them). Tactical voting among Remain supporters is much more complicated because it involves more parties, withvarying Brexit policies. The Lib Dems the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are all pro-Remain. The Labour Party is in favour of a referendum but has not committed to supporting Remain or Leave. Pro-Remain parties also disagree on other issues, and they do not always say nice things about each other's party leaders. For all of these reasons, many supporters of these parties are not keen on switching tactically in favour of one of the others. It is often difficult to identify Remain candidates best placed to win seats from Conservatives. This is because different pro-Remain parties did well in different places at the last general election. General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? What's more, there have been big changes in the opinion polls since 2017. On average in the polls, the Labour vote has dropped by 10 percentage points since the last election, while the Lib Dem vote has increased by six points. This suggests the Lib Dems may have overtaken Labour in as many as 55 of the 273 seats where Conservatives are defending and Labour came second last time. At this and previous elections there have been constituency polls to guide people in some high profile places. Now there are also sophisticated statistical models of polling data attempting to show how support for the parties stands in every constituency. These models have been used by campaign groups to set up websites encouraging people to vote tactically for particular parties in particular constituencies. What is the secret behind tactical voting? Are ads and leaflets on tactical voting misleading people? Some go so far as to organise vote swapping - matching people from different constituencies so they can both vote tactically, knowing that someone somewhere else will be voting for their preferred party. Tactical voting websites largely agree on which pro-Remain parties are best placed to win in which constituencies, but they do not entirely agree. There have also been changes in public opinion since those websites were set up, and there might well be further changes before election day. And, of course, all polls and forecasts may be inaccurate. So tactical voting websites cannot be entirely relied on. Voters have to form their own judgements as to whom they want to vote for and why.

Where do the parties stand on Brexit?Suu Kyi rejects genocide claims at top UN court,"The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK gears up for the general election on 12 December. But where do the parties stand on Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to leave the European Union (EU) with the revised deal he agreed. He says that with a majority Conservative government,he would start the process to ""get Brexit done"" on day one,externalof the new Parliament. He previously said the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". However, Mr Johnson was forced to write a Brexit extension letter to the EU, after MPs failed to approve his revised deal. Mr Johnson secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May. It includes scrappingthe controversial Irish backstopand replacing it witha new customs arrangement. Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal has not yet been approved by the UK Parliament Brexit left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line. Ten were later welcomed back. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Key Conservative Party manifesto promises explained If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. It says it will achieve this within six months. Labour says its referendumwould be a choice between a ""sensible"" Leave option versus Remain.,external Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship. This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. If a referendum was held,Mr Corbyn has said he would remain neutralif he was prime minister ""so I can credibly carry out the results"". Just like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"". While Labour's election strategy early on was to emphasise that the vote was about more than Brexit, it is changing its focus. The message now is thatLabour's leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Mr Johnson's deal- it wants to find what it believes is a better one. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Key Labour Party manifesto promises explained The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum,externalon Brexit. Alternatively,it wants Article 50 revokedif it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""catastrophic"" The SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU. SNP launch: Scotland's Remain party? The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the general election. Party leader Jo Swinson says a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference. If the Lib Dems do not win a majority, they would support another referendum. Leader Jo Swinson says thatstopping Brexit would free up Â£50bn, over five years, to spend on public services. She says that so-called ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra money for schools and to help support low-paid workers. Lib Dems promise Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Key Lib Dems manifesto promises explained The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons during the last Parliament. However,while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU,,externalit opposes elements of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal which relate to Northern Ireland,. The DUP is unhappy with the revised Brexit deal At its manifesto launch,the party said it will seek further changes to the dealif he is still prime minister after the election. The deal includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland. One gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a majority vote on how customs arrangements would work after Brexit. The DUP wants such a vote to be taken on a cross-community basis, rather than a straight majority. Johnson 'should seek Brexit deal changes' This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour, in part because of their positions on Brexit. It backs another referendum, or ""People's Vote"",,externaland wants the UK to remain in the EU. The party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting Leave in the referendum.It wants a further referendum,externaland to Remain. In a bid to get as many pro-Remain MPs as possible into Parliament,Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Greens have agreed an electoral pactin 11 of the 40 seats in Wales.

How a 'genocide' was investigated,"About 725,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar over the past 12 months, many for Bangladesh Indiscriminate killing; villages burned to the ground; children assaulted; women gang-raped - these are the findings of United Nations investigators who allege that ""the gravest crimes under international law"" were committed in Myanmar last August. Such was their severity, the report said, the army must be investigated for genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine state. The investigators' conclusions came despite them not being granted access to Myanmar by the government there,which has since rejected the report. This is how the investigators came to their conclusions. On 24 March 2017, the UN Human Rights Council agreed to form an independent fact-finding mission on Myanmar to look into ""alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces"". Five months after the mission was formed, Myanmar's army launched a major assault on Rakhine state, following deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts. The military's campaign became the main focus of the investigation, which also looked into rights abuses in Kachin and Shan states. The mission wrote to Myanmar's government three times asking for access to the country. It received no response. ""The first rule was 'do no harm',"" says Christopher Sidoti, one of the three people who headed the investigation. ""Those people we spoke to had been heavily traumatised, and if our staff considered that an interview would be re-traumatising, it wouldn't have been conducted. ""No evidence is so important that it warrants re-traumatising someone who has gone through all these experiences."" What next for Myanmar after damning report? At least 725,000 people have fled Rakhine state over the past 12 months, many to neighbouring Bangladesh. As a result, despite not getting access to Myanmar, investigators were able to gather a vast amount of testimony from people who had experienced violence at first-hand before fleeing. Many made the treacherous journey from Rakhine to Bangladesh by sea They spoke to 875 people in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the UK, and made a decision early on that the most valuable testimony would come from people who had not shared their stories before. Seeing through the official story in Myanmar ""We didn't want to interview people who had been interviewed by other organisations,"" Mr Sidoti, an Australian human rights law expert, says. ""We didn't want a situation where people's evidence could have been tainted. ""We tried to get people from a wide variety of areas and when we became more and more focused later on, we would deliberately, through a community network, seek out others from that area to get a better picture of what went on."" ""We would never use just one account as proof,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""We always sought corroboration from primary and secondary sources."" Those sources included videos, photographs, documents and satellite images, which showed the destruction of Rohingya villages over several months in 2017. In one case, investigators had received several reports from refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, that a village had been destroyed in particular circumstances at a particular time. Investigators were then able to source satellite images that corroborated what witnesses had said. Satellites images showed that: About 392 villages were partially or totally destroyed in northern Rakhine state Close to 40% of all homes in the area - 37,700 buildings - were affected About 80% were burned in the first three weeks of the military campaign This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women Getting hold of photographic evidence from the ground proved to be more of a challenge. ""When people were leaving Rakhine state, they were being stopped, searched and deprived of their money, gold and mobile phones,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""It seemed pretty clear this was an attempt to get video or photographic evidence they had recorded. ""There wasn't much left but we made use of it."" UN says military leaders must face genocide charges Myanmar rejects UN accusation of 'genocide' The report names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and his deputy. How were investigators able to point the finger directly at these men? The case here is not based on a paper trail, or a recording, but instead on research. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Investigators relied heavily on others' detailed understanding of how Myanmar's government works. Among them was a military adviser who had co-operated with war crimes tribunals in the past. ""We have been able to access extraordinary international advice on various aspects of Myanmar's military,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""The conclusion we have come up with is that the army is so tightly controlled that nothing happens involving the army in Myanmar without the commander-in-chief and his deputies knowing."" While the people believed to have given the orders have been named, work is ongoing to identify the members of the military who may have committed atrocities. ""We do have a list of alleged perpetrators on the ground and they will remain confidential for now,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""Their names have come up frequently enough for them to be put on lists to face more investigation."" Identifying what appears to be genocide and proving that what happened fits the legal definition of genocide are two different things. ""Evidence of crimes against humanity was very quickly obtained and was quite overwhelming,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""Genocide is a much more legally complex issue."" Christopher Sidoti: ""None of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was"" As the report states, genocide is when ""a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". The key word is ""intent"". Investigators believe the evidence of that intent by the Myanmar army is clear. Could Suu Kyi face genocide charges? Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefully They cite statements by commanders and suspected perpetrators, and the degree of planning required to carry out such an operation. But still, identifying a genocide from a legal perspective took a significant amount of legal work. ""We arrived at a position we had not expected to be in when we were beginning,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""None of the three of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was. That came as a surprise."" The report says that the six military officials should face trial. It also condemns Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to intervene to stop attacks, and the UN's outgoing rights chief this week said she should have resigned as a result. The report also makes a series of recommendations, including the referral of the investigation to the International Criminal Court or to a new tribunal, and the imposition of an arms embargo. However, China has so far resisted strong action against its neighbour and ally Myanmar on the UN Security Council, where it holds a veto. Mr Sidoti acknowledges that officials in Myanmar are unlikely to investigate the allegations themselves. Last year, an internal investigation by the army exonerated itself of blame in the Rohingya crisis, and Myanmar's Permanent Representative to the UN last week told BBC Burmese the report was full of ""one-sided accusations against us"". ""We have made recommendations and it is up to others to act on them,"" Mr Sidoti says. ""I have a high expectation that the Security Council will act on its responsibilities. But I'm not naive.""

Most-viewed mansions of 2019 revealed,"The 16-bedroom Glenborrodale Castle is on the list of five More than a quarter of those clicking on property websites have no intention to buy. No wonder they end up looking at the most striking homes available. A castle, a multi-million pound penthouse, and an audacious mirrored bedroom ceiling are among the most-viewed, according to Rightmove. The properties include a boathouse, private cinemas, and a replica Angel of the North - in Essex. In contrast, the UK housing market has been relatively undramatic this year. Relatively few homes have been put up for sale owing to political uncertainty and worries about the economy. One bedroom feature - part of another property in the most-viewed - is clearly a talking point It might not be to everyone's taste but the master bedroom in one mansion in Chigwell, Essex, features a huge mirror above the bed. It also has a replica, but smaller, Angel of the North sculpture outside. ""Suffice to say the properties with the biggest personalities or quirkiest features are usually the most popular,"" said Miles Shipside, of Rightmove. Housing costs: Five surprises explained Is rent cheaper in the next street? Use our map to find out Join our Affordable Living Facebook group here,external A survey of 6,000 people by rival property portal, Zoopla, earlier this year suggested that 27% of people had no intention to buy or sell. Fewer were actively looking for a specific property to buy than those browsing in general with an ambition to move or buy a first home. It also suggested that 31% of those asked knew the exact house or street they wanted to live in next. This increases to 48% in London. So, many of them may end up viewing and sharing top-end listings. They often feature cinema rooms, swimming pools, and those with a rich history.

Its tips for viewings include fixing the nagging DIY jobs, taking it easy on strong-smelling scents, ensuring it is warm, doing what you can to keep rooms well-lit, keeping the garden tidy, and putting pets out of the way during potential buyers' visits. ""Winter can be a really difficult time to make a sale, with the gloomy weather, people's reluctance to move house during the colder, shorter days, and even buyers and estate agents taking time off for Christmas,"" said Ross Counsel, director at Good Move.

Parent school donations 'exacerbating inequality',"Some schools say they need donations for ""necessities"", such as books Pupils in some of the poorest regions of England are losing out because parents cannot afford to fill a funding shortfall with donations, BBC News has found. In 2017-18, the average school in London raised Â£43,000 from donations. In Yorkshire, it was just Â£13,300. The Fair Education Alliance said this gap ""exacerbates unfairness between rich and poor"". The main political parties have all pledged to improve school funding. Money is often brought in through fundraising events, such as this mud run The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme's analysis of Department for Education data shows the average school in England generated Â£59 per pupil from donations in 2017-18 - 1.07% of its overall budget. The money is often raised through events, such as fun runs and school fairs. But there is a clear divide across the UK. While schools in London, the east of England (Â£24,585 per year) and the North West (Â£20,844) are the most likely to profit; those in Yorkshire (Â£13,288), the North East (Â£13,394) and East Midlands (Â£17,044) struggle. Individual schools also fare very differently. One school in Sunderland gained just Â£679 from donations, the equivalent of 43p per pupil, in 2017-18. At Westmoor Primary School - just outside Newcastle - fewer than 6% of pupils are eligible for free school meals. There, a recent muddy fun run raised Â£4,500 for pupils. While such events last year brought in Â£16,000 - or Â£45 per child. The money, head teacher Sharon Trundley says, will go towards ""necessities"", such as books. The school also has a set of iPads, ""which we wouldn't have been able to buy outright [otherwise]"", she adds. Its donations are below the national average but above par for the North East. In the north east, school donations are below the national average Some schools, like Hawthorn Primary, fare much worse. Based in Newcastle's city centre, nearly 50% of its pupils have free school meals. Last year its donations brought in just Â£1,200 - less than Â£5.50 per pupil. Head teacher Jane Dube says it is struggling with failing equipment such as outdated laptops. ""The parents we work with, the little they do have they need for their families and their homes,"" she said. ""They are incredibly generous with the school but we can't always expect that to happen."" It has just formed a parent teacher association to try to look for ways to bring in funding. Sam Butters, head of the Fair Education Alliance - a coalition of 150 organisations aimed at tackling perceived inequalities in the school system - said: ""The fact that parents in wealthier areas can afford to fill some of this funding gap exacerbates unfairness between rich and poor. ""We know that schools in all areas are cash-strapped as funding has decreased in real terms during the period of austerity, so it is not surprising that they are making efforts to seek funds from alternative sources. ""Teachers and school leaders are increasingly reporting a lack of funding for necessities - including, for example, teaching assistants to support in classrooms. ""If insufficient school funding requires donations from parents to meet shortfalls, schools in deprived areas are going to lose out."" Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in Junefound since 2009, spending had fallen by 8% per pupil once rising costs such as pay and pension contributions were taken into account. One head teacher in in south Londontold BBC News in Marchshe had had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of funding shortages. All five main parties in England have made pledges on education. Here are some of their key policies: The Conservatives have promised Â£7.1bn a year more for schools in England by 2022-23 Labour have pledged to provide free school meals to all primary school children and reduce class sizes to under 30 across all schools in England The Liberal Democrats have said they will recruit 20,000 more teachers and increase schools funding by Â£10.6bn a year by 2024-25 The Greens have outlined plans to increase school funding by at least Â£4bn a year The Brexit Party has said it will ensure all young people have the choice between a high-quality apprenticeship, setting up their own business or pursuing further or higher education Compare the party manifestoshere.

Chickens to be culled after bird flu outbreak,"Some of the chickens were found to have a strain of avian flu All 27,000 chickens at a farm in Suffolk will be slaughtered after cases of bird flu were confirmed. A number of the birds were found to have the H5 strain of avian flu, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. It set up a 1km (0.6 mile) exclusion zone around the farm, near Eye, to limit risk of the disease spreading. Dr Gavin Dabrera, from Public Health England, said the risk to public health was very low. The Food Standards Agency said there was no food safety risk as long as poultry products, including eggs, are thoroughly cooked. The strain at the commercial farm at Athelington has been identified as ""low pathogenic avian flu"" (LPAI). Dr Dabrera, a public health consultant at Public Health England, said: ""Avian flu (often called bird flu) is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public's health is very low. ""As a precaution, we are offering public health advice and anti-virals to those who had contact with the affected birds, as is standard practice."" A detailed investigation is under way to determine the most likely source of the outbreak. The outbreak was discovered at a farm in Athelington, near Eye in Suffolk The British Poultry Council said there was no link to the Christmas turkey market, which was ""unaffected"" by the case. Suffolk poultry farmer Alaistaire Brice, who farms near to the exclusion zone, said the outbreak was a concern for bird farmers but not the wider public. He said: ""It is a difficult one to take, especially at this time of year. We know it is always in the background but last year was quite an easy year for us with regards to the risks of managing birds."" Chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: ""Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good bio-security on their premises. ""We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this strain to control and eliminate it."" National Farmers Union chief poultry adviser Gary Ford said: ""This confirmation of avian influenza is devastating news for the farm affected. However, Defra's prompt action has helped limit the risk of the disease spreading, and provided that it's contained to one site will have very little impact on the wider poultry industry. ""It is imperative that all poultry keepers, including small backyard flocks, remain vigilant at this time and report any sign of disease immediately, as well as maintaining good biosecurity measures."" In 2017, some23,000 chickens were destroyedat Bridge Farm in Redgrave on the Suffolk/Norfolk border after the H5N8 avian influenza virus was found, and in Junethe same strain was identifiedin about 35 chickens and geese at a farm near Diss in Norfolk.

Major emitters accused of blocking progress,"Climate protesters on the streets of Madrid during COP25 Delegates from developing countries have reacted angrily to what they see as attempts to block progress at the COP25 meeting in Madrid. One negotiator told the BBC that the talks had failed to find agreement on a range of issues because of the blocking actions of some large emitters. Carlos Fuller from Belize said that Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India and China were ""part of the problem"". Other observers said there was a serious risk of failure at the talks. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Exxon wins New York climate change fight Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Amazon oil boom under fire at UN climate talks Ministers from all over the world have arrived in Madrid for the high-end negotiations that will determine the final outcome of this conference. Despite a huge climate demonstration on the streets of the Spanish capital last Friday, hopes of an ambitious declaration at COP25 have smacked straight into the realities of politics and entrenched positions. Delegates listen to ministerial speeches at COP25 The central aim of the meeting is to ""raise ambition"" and set out a plan by which countries will put new climate pledges on the table before the end of next year. But already there are signs that some major emitters are trying to limit the scale of what can be achieved in Madrid. ""There's an effort right now to block the words 'climate urgency' in text from Brazil and Saudi Arabia, saying we haven't used these words before in the UN, so we can't use them now,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. ""This gap between what's happening on the outside and what's happening in the science, and this 'UN speak' that won't react and drive something is very frustrating."" Negotiators have told the BBC that the obstinacy of some countries was limiting agreement on non-contentious questions. ""I am very disturbed and angry,"" said Carlos Fuller, the chief negotiator for the small island developing states group of countries. Carbon market negotiators have been accused of trampling on human rights in pursuit of profit ""At 2.30 this morning we couldn't agree to continue working on a transparency framework, that tells the world what each country is doing, we couldn't agree to keep working on it. That is ridiculous"" One issue that has caused a good deal of anger are the attempts by Brazil, China, India and Saudi Arabia to have the actions that were due to be completed before 2020 by richer nations, re-examined as part of the overall deal here in Madrid. Carlos Fuller says that this sort of backward focus by these major emitting countries doesn't help anyone to make progress. ""They are part of the problem, they are looking too much backward to say that the developed countries have not done what they should have done and hence we are not going to do the same thing,"" ""I disagree with that totally. We are all on this one planet together. We need to recognise the mistakes of the past and not replicate them."" Mr Fuller said this ""game of chicken"" approach to the negotiations was a threat to the overall success of the talks. The mood among many campaigners is low as there seems to be little hope of progress on the two major outstanding issues that need to resolved here. These are the question of carbon markets and the issue of loss and damage. One of the key questions on carbon markets is the question of carrying over old credits. Some believe that if efforts by Brazil and others to carry forward billions of credits created under older, discredited schemes are successful, they could ""bankrupt"" the entire Paris pact. There were some positive signs in the conference with US presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg telling the meeting that his first action if he gets elected would be to re-join the Paris agreement. While there are still several days to go, there is hope that the presence of political figures such as Mr Bloomberg and new announcements by the European Union and others will help foster an ambitious agreement. But there is also deep concern that this might not happen. ""I hope that they support a coalition of countries that beat back the darker forces here in Madrid that want to hold the world back,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. ""If not, it will be a moral failure,"" she said.

Leaders in final push for votes ahead of electionThe party leaders will tour the country in the critical final hours before polls open on Thursday.,"The UK's party leaders are touring the country on a frenetic final day of campaigning, focusing on key messages ahead of Thursday's general election. Boris Johnson has insisted only the Tories will ""get Brexit done"" and move the country forward while Jeremy Corbyn has vowed Labour will end austerity and give ""hope to the next generation"". Jo Swinson has said a strong Lib Dem showing can stop the UK leaving the EU. Nicola Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP in Scotland could stop a Tory victory. With voting set to begin at 07:00 GMT on Thursday, the parties are stressing the scale of the choice facing people and the impact it will have on the direction of the country. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said voters were being offered hugely divergent choices when it came to the UK's relationship with Europe, with the Conservatives promising to leave the European Union next month while Labour and others were backing a further referendum. Election 2019 manifesto guide Who is standing for election in my area? A really simple guide to the election And the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam said both the Tories and Labour were proposing fundamental changes to how the UK's economy and trade have worked over the past 30 years. In terms of the opinion polls, the Conservatives retain a solid lead over Labour,according to the BBC's opinion poll tracker. A poll produced by YouGov released on Tuesday evening suggests the Conservatives are on course for a small majority of around 28 - but the pollster points out that the margin of error means neither another hung Parliament nor a larger Tory majority can be ruled out. Labour is hoping for a late swing in its favour, as happened in the 2017 general election, while the Tories are warning about the possibility of a hung Parliament, amid concerns about voter complacency. Both Conservative and Labour party leaders will be hoping to put a rocky few days behind them, as they embark on the traditional election-eve tour of target seats. The prime minister visited a bakery in Derby on Wednesday Mr Johnson began Wednesday by doing a milk round in West Yorkshire, saying the election campaign ""could not be tighter"" and that there is a ""real risk again of a hung Parliament"". He said: ""The critical risk is very real. We cannot have more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country."" He is using events throughout the day, including a visit to a bakery in Derbyshire, to stress key Tory pledges on investing in the NHS, raising the number of police officers and bringing in a new immigration system. But his main message will be on Brexit, saying ""unless we get out of this quicksand... our future as a country remains uncertain"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today that only a clear Conservative victory would lift the UK out of the ""rut"" it had fallen into over Brexit and enable the country to ""move on"" to dealing with other challenges, like social care and the environment. Mr Corbyn started the day in Scotland, telling a rally in Glasgow that a Labour government would ""eliminate child poverty, give hope to the next generation and invest properly in education all across the UK"". At a rally in Middlesbrough, he repeated pledges on funding for the NHS, expanding free childcare and lowering transport fares, and also addressed Brexit, saying Labour would get it sorted by securing a ""good deal for working people"" and giving the public the ""final say"". Jeremy Corbyn held a rally in Middlesbrough He told activists: ""Remember it is our choice, our chance tomorrow, to elect a government that will be for the many, not the few. A government you can trust. ""And it will not be motivated solely by more billionaires... it will be motivated by improving the life chances of every single child all across this country, and bringing justice."" Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mr Corbyn had a ""real live chance"" of being prime minister by Friday, telling the BBC's Politics Live that while Brexit was a tough issue in many seats, what voters were really concerned about was the future of the NHS, schools and the cost of living. However, a group of 15 former Labour MPs, including several who quit the party over the past year, have urged voters to back other parties, saying Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister due to his record on anti-Semitism and national security. Responding, Mr Corbyn said: ""People who have left the Labour Party and decided to join up with the party that has imposed austerity, poverty and injustice on the poorest people in this country should look themselves in the mirror and decide what they are doing."" Meanwhile, Ms Swinson said the last few hours were ""absolutely critical"" with thousands of voters yet to make up their minds. On a visit to Esher in Surrey, where the Lib Dems hope to oust Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, she said tactical voting could determine the outcome of Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats and Labour voters in such areas could hold the result ""in their hands"". She also visited a volunteer hub in London to thank activists, adding: ""Our country can be better than what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to say is the only way forward."" Campaigning in Esher, Jo Swinson said her aim was to ""stop Boris and stop Brexit"" Back on the road again today for the leaders' last push. There feels like there's been a real mismatch between the nature and conduct of the campaign and the scale of the choice. It's a huge moment for the country, but we've heard so many times voters saying they don't like ""either of them"". People's thinking is really dominated by the two big characters in the campaign and no-one is making it to No 10 on a surge of anything like enthusiasm. People seem fed up of politicians telling them how divided they are - most people have been quite rightly getting on with their lives while Westminster has torn itself apart. This video can not be played BBC Political editor Laura Kuenssberg sums up the election campaign. The frustration Tories hoped to capitalise on is real, but there are doubts all over the place about whether Boris Johnson is the answer to that. However, beyond his strong core support there seems to be less appetite for Jeremy Corbyn to take it on. There is a massive generational split though. Smaller parties haven't punched through as some predicted, although they will still have a huge impact, and there are a vast number of local factors at play, of course, too. Anyway, enough musing for now. Suffice to say this is an incredibly tight contest in lots of places. In 48 hours we might be waiting in a freezing Downing Street for Mr Johnson to return with a majority, or about to enter a frenzy of hung Parliament talks which could propel Mr Corbyn into power. The SNP is taking a similar tack in its appeal to Labour voters in Scotland, calling on them to back the party to ""lock Boris Johnson out of No 10"". Describing the PM's Get Brexit Done slogan as the ""biggest con"" of the election, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was a vote to stop further cuts to public services and to ""stop Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will"". Green Party co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley urged voters to make it a moment of political reckoning on the climate, saying their party would make sure proper action was taken to meet carbon emission targets. Scotland's future should lie in its own hands, Nicola Sturgeon said on a visit to a greengrocer's in Edinburgh The Green Party's co-leaders urged people to make this a climate election at a photo call in London Nigel Farage is hoping to get a handful of Brexit Party candidates ""over the line"" Speaking in Doncaster, Nigel Farage said the Brexit Party was challenging Labour in many of its Yorkshire heartlands, and he appealed to Leave supporters to back his candidates in areas where the Conservatives could not win. Plaid Cymru's leader, Adam Price, told the BBC that Wales was the ""forgotten nation"" in the UK and had been ""neglected"" for decades by successive Conservative and Labour governments. He said his party would press whoever formed the next UK government for more resources to tackle child poverty, while also making the case to remain in the EU and ultimately for Wales to govern itself.

So what happened?  If you're still not sure who to vote for, check out our manifesto comparison tool here. Things will look a little different tomorrow, as we're subject to strict restrictions on what we can publish while polls are open. Thanks for joining us here on the live page throughout this election campaign. We'll be back with you all through tomorrow, into the night and throughout Friday. See you then. There's only one place to be tomorrow night - and that's here on the BBC. Here's how to follow our coverage: Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The main messages of the leaders are clear. But beyond two separate ardent cores, they can struggle to convince even everyone on their own side. The wider public's mantra is not ""get Brexit done"" or ""it's time for real change"", but perhaps instead ""we're not convinced by any of you"". But this election has not been an exercise in enthusiasm - there is a sense that the politicians available may not be the ones to answer convincingly the questions they have set. Making his final pitch to voters, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says: ""Nine years ago, the Tories and Lib Dems got together and decided that they would go down the road of austerity - a political choice. ""A political choice to cut spending to local government, a political choice to freeze welfare spending, a political choice to freeze public sector wages, a political choice to underfund the National Health Service, a political choice to treble university fees, a political choice to impose poverty on the already poorest people in the country. ""They did all that knowing what the consequences would be. ""So when the election comes tomorrow, it is a very clear choice. You go down the road of Boris Johnson: a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump, you break off any serious relationship with Europe,"" he continues. ""Or you go down the Labour way, the adult, responsible way of negotiating a settlement that we will all live by and I will make sure is carried out in a future relationship with Europe. ""But we also go down the road of investing in our country, investing to end austerity, and re-distributing wealth and power in our society in a way that's never been seen before by any government in Britain."" Jeremy Corbyn, speaking in east London at his last campaign event of the day, says: ""Tomorrow we're our knocking on doors like our life depends on it, as the lives of many do."" He recounts enthusiastic Labour events around the country ""in the big city, the small places"", adding: ""You wouldn't know it from much of the media reporting of the election. It's commentators speculating on other commentators."" He interrupts shouting from the audience by saying: ""No, no, no, we believe in a free press, I just wish they'd free themselves from the shackles of the billionaires.""

Head over to our election translator, where we explain all the terms you need to know. Listing his Conservative Party's manifesto pledges, Boris Johnson continues with a promise of ""50,000 new nurses... 50,000 more nurses I should sayâ¦ while the BBC are checking it."" Indeed we are Mr Johnson. He is of course referencing his party's pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. As our health editor Hugh Pympreviously explained: ""It is not right to say that the Conservatives plan to recruit 50,000 more nurses or find 50,000 new nurses."" That's because of that number, 31,500 would be new nurses (19,000 newly-trained recruits and 12,500 overseas recruits). But the remaining 18,500 would be existing nurses persuaded not to quit, or to come back. Speaking at the Tories' final campaign rally in London, Boris Johnson tells party supporters they have a ""national duty to find every vote to save our country from disaster"". The Conservative leader says the race is ""tight and getting tighter,"" adding that a vote for any other party could lead to a hung Parliament and ""economic disaster"". He adds that Jeremy Corbyn would hold another referendum on the EU, while the Tories would - as we've heard him say many, many times in recent weeks - ""get Brexit done"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove has just taken to the stage at a rally in east London, where Boris Johnson is expected to speak soon. ""Well friends. This is it. The moment of truth,"" Mr Gove begins. He goes on to attack the other party leaders. ""On anti-Semitism, on national security, on the economy, on Brexit, on every issue of importance to this country, Jeremy Corbyn gets it wrong,"" he says, describing him as an ""apology of a leader"". Moving on to talk about SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, he says: ""She doesn't love this country, she wants to tear it in two. So again, let the message go out from this hall, we say 'Nicola, hands off our precious United Kingdom'."" ""As for Jo Swinson, the leader of the party that calls itself the Liberal Democrats,"" he continues. ""She wants to take the biggest democratic vote in this country, the proposition that we should leave the European Union and cancel it outright. She's neither liberal, nor democratic."" Mr Corbyn haspreviously saidanti-Jewish racism was ""vile and wrong"" and would not be tolerated in any form under a future Labour government. What is this election for? How does voting work?

The Conservatives have told the Andrew Neil Show they do not want to put anyone up for interview the night before the election. So instead, Neil is interviewing former deputy prime minister Lord Michael Heseltine - who has made his Remain beliefs very clear during the campaign. Asked if Boris Johnson is fit to be prime minister, he says he has ""avoided discussion about personality issues"" in the run-up to the election as ""great issues become slanging matches"". But Lord Heseltine says the ""overarching"" issue of the campaign has been Brexit. He says there needs to be a coalition ""for one reason only"" and that is to get another referendum on Brexit ""now that the issues are clearer than they were three years ago"". However, he doesn't want Jeremy Corbyn to lead it. Lord Heseltine says Labour is ""itching to get rid"" of Mr Corbyn, and there were many moderates who could take his place. ""We are facing a period of prolonged uncertainty,"" he adds. ""There is no way of getting Brexit done in a matter of weeks or months. ""The alternative is we have a no overall control Parliament, out of which comes a short-term coalition for the one purpose of another referendum. ""There would be delay, yes, but much shorter delay than the anxiety and uncertainty of going through with Brexit."" Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib is next up in the chair on The Andrew Neil Show. He criticises Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, saying the PM had ""piveted"" back to closer alignment with the EU, and away from what had won over his party. As a result, Nigel Farage's decision to stand down in Tory-held seats may have been a mistake. ""With the benefit of hindsight, we would not have pulled out of so many seats,"" he says. ""With the benefit of hindsight, and given where the prime minister is going, we probably shouldn't have pulled out of all those seats."" However, Mr Habib denies the campaign has been a ""shambles"", and says the Brexit Party has a ""really, really good chance in a number of seats in the Midlands, the north and Wales"" - even if he admits the campaign ""could have gone better"". Now Andrew Neil talks to Prof Sir John Curtice - our polling expert - ahead of tomorrow's vote. Prof Sir John says the ""principle story"" of the election has been that it remains a two-party fight in England and Wales. He explains that the Tories gained five points in the polls over the campaign, but Labour did the same. ""The result of which is, the Conservatives have maintained their lead of 10 points."" Prof Sir John says the Tories squeezed the votes of the Brexit Party, while Labour squeezed those of the Lib Dems. And what does that show? ""This country is still divided more or less down the middle on whether it wants to leave the EU or stay,"" he adds. Andrew Neil lists some of the other policies, including banning gas heating and cutting flights. He then asks the Green's co-leader what the point was of causing ""pain"" to people if China continues to pump carbon into the air? Sian Berry says: ""There is a climate emergency, the children are on the streets around the entire globe. ""You cannot argue the UK shouldn't [act]."" She adds: ""China needs to come on board with the same reductions. ""What's your argument, that we should not bother? That we should not be the climate leaders? ""It is not pain - we are talking about building a better Britain."" The next interviewee on The Andrew Neil Show is the Green Party's co-leader Sian Berry. She says her party has been ""leading the agenda"" and pushing other parties to tackle climate change. Neil questions whether the plans the Greens have - spending Â£100bn a year to cut emissions by 2030 - line up with comments by experts. But Ms Berry says her party wants to ensure the planet doesn't ""tip into runaway climate change"" that cannot be reversed. ""[Our plans] are about changing the whole system really dramatically and investing in decarbonisation,"" she adds. Finally, Neil questions the shadow transport secretary on accusations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Asked whether he has read the report by the Jewish Labour movement, Mr McDonald says he hasn't seen it all, but feels ""incredibly saddened"" by the incidents. ""But equally I feel absolutely determined as a member of shadow cabinet... to root this out and Jeremy Corbyn is committed to this cause"". Mr McDonald also says Mr Corbyn has ""made strides ever since he became leader"", and wants to see anti-Semitism ""tackled in wider society"". Andrew Neil says the percentage difference between the Tories' and Labour's plans on spending for the NHS were tiny, and to say the NHS was at risk was ""scaremongering"". But Andy McDonald says the presenter should ""look at the record"". ""Look at cancelling nursing bursaries,"" he says. ""What a ridiculous thing to do when we need nurses in the NHS."" Mr McDonald says ""every step is counter intuitive"" by the Conservatives, adding: ""That's why we need the change."" The Andrew Neil Show is on BBC Two for an hour-long special right now. The presenter says the last week of campaigning has been full of ""fervour, fury and even the odd climbdown"". Neil also doesn't let it pass without mention thatBoris Johnson never did sit down with him for a prime time interview... But moving on, he asks shadow transport secretary Andy McDonaldabout the embarrassment caused by his colleague, Jon Ashworth, this week, when a leaked conversation saw the shadow health secretary casting doubt on Labour's chance's tomorrow. Mr McDonald says it was a ""friendly conversation"" and ""banter"" with someone he thought was a friend, not Mr Ashworth's views. ""It leads us to conclude you shouldn't trust a Tory,"" he says. But Mr McDonald does admit he would have been a ""little more cautious"" and ""wouldn't have the confidence to have that banter"" without expecting someone to misinterpret it. Â© 2025 BBC.

WTO chief: 'Months' needed to fix disputes body,"Director General of the World Trade Organisation Roberto Azevedo says it will take ""a few months"" to fix its main body for settling trade disputes. It has ground to a halt because the US has blocked the appointment of new judges. A minimum of three are needed and today there is just one in place. The Appellate Body has the final say on disputes that cover billions of dollars of international trade and its decisions are supposed to be binding. However, now that it has ceased to function and can't take on new cases Mr Azevedo conceded that ""significant changes in the dispute settlement mechanism"" will be needed and that ""intensive consultations"" will start immediately. These are likely to include ""looking at issues like how fast can the disputes settlement work"", he said in a BBC interview The WTO's Appellate Body's been called ""probably the busiest international dispute settlement system in the world"" Those changes are being demanded by President Trump's administration in Washington. Their argument is that the WTO has treated the United States unfairly. Some of their criticisms are shared by other countries but others are not. Despite this Mr Azevedo says that Donald Trump's tenure as US president is not a barrier to reaching a solution. ""It's whether we can find fixes that everybody can live with"". He adds that, ""these are extremely complex conversations and negotiations and very political in nature, so we have to understand this is not something that is going to be solved overnight, just like that"". Trade disputes settlement system facing crisis Mr Trump's role is disputed by Professor James Bacchus, a former chairman, or chief judge, of the WTO Appellate Body as well as a former US trade negotiator. He told the BBC there is ""little chance of resolving this while Donald Trump is still president in a way that will continue to preserve the independence and impartiality of the Appellate Body and the rest of the WTO dispute settlement system"". He says that whilst the US has won the vast majority of cases it has bought at the WTO it has repeatedly violated the trade remedies imposed on it by the organisation. President Trump has denied that he would pull the US out of the WTO Professor Bacchus says that many of the US claims against the WTO are ""trumped up"". The US, however, thinks that the WTO dispute system interprets the WTO rules in a way that creates new obligations for WTO members,according to US ambassador to the WTO, Dennis Shea,external. One area that particularly grates in Washington is dumping, when a foreign supplier sells goods abroad more cheaply than at home. The US and others have used a disputed method for assessing whether goods have been dumped and how much the the price is below what it should be. It's not explicitly prohibited by the WTO rules, but the Appellate Body took the view that it was in effect against their spirit. Professor Bacchus says that immobilizing the WTO Appellate Body is an attempt by the US to replace the rule of law in trade ""with the rule of power"". Instead of turning to the WTO President Trump has repeatedly used tariffs to address his trade concerns, seeing them as a way to gain leverage over his adversaries. This has meant tit for tat tariffs against China in what is becoming a protracted trade war. They have also been used in disputes with countries including Brazil, Argentina, Turkey and the European Union. With the WTO paralysed, these other countries may now be tempted to lend their support to the EU plans for a new an alternative interim system for settling international trade disputes. China, the world's second biggest economy, is also now reported to be looking to support the move.

Most-viewed mansions of 2019 revealedCastles and mirrored ceilings attracted clicks among window shoppers on a property website.Business,"The 16-bedroom Glenborrodale Castle is on the list of five More than a quarter of those clicking on property websites have no intention to buy. No wonder they end up looking at the most striking homes available. A castle, a multi-million pound penthouse, and an audacious mirrored bedroom ceiling are among the most-viewed, according to Rightmove. The properties include a boathouse, private cinemas, and a replica Angel of the North - in Essex. In contrast, the UK housing market has been relatively undramatic this year. Relatively few homes have been put up for sale owing to political uncertainty and worries about the economy. One bedroom feature - part of another property in the most-viewed - is clearly a talking point It might not be to everyone's taste but the master bedroom in one mansion in Chigwell, Essex, features a huge mirror above the bed. It also has a replica, but smaller, Angel of the North sculpture outside. ""Suffice to say the properties with the biggest personalities or quirkiest features are usually the most popular,"" said Miles Shipside, of Rightmove.

Use our map to find out Join our Affordable Living Facebook group here,external A survey of 6,000 people by rival property portal, Zoopla, earlier this year suggested that 27% of people had no intention to buy or sell. Fewer were actively looking for a specific property to buy than those browsing in general with an ambition to move or buy a first home. It also suggested that 31% of those asked knew the exact house or street they wanted to live in next. This increases to 48% in London. So, many of them may end up viewing and sharing top-end listings. They often feature cinema rooms, swimming pools, and those with a rich history.

New volcanic activity slows NZ recovery effortsThere'd been hopes to bring back the bodies from the island but police says it's too dangerous.Asia,"Poisonous gases are believed to be coming from the volcanic vent New Zealand's White Island volcano is showing increased seismic activity, putting recovery efforts on hold. Authorities had hoped they would be able to retrieve the bodies of those left behind on the island, all of whom are presumed dead, on Wednesday. The exact death toll is unclear. Police say at least six people died, two of them since leaving the island, and nine are officially missing. Another 22 people are in intensive care with severe burns. One has been moved to Australia. Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption Can we predict volcanic eruptions? The volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted on Monday when dozens of tourists were on the island. ""I've spoken to many of those involved in the operation and they are very, very eager to get back there, they want to bring people's loved ones home,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters. Mother and daughter Julie and Jessica Richards, aged 47 and 20, are among the dead White Island is a popular tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. At least 47 visitors from around the world were on the volcano crater at the time of two explosions in quick succession. Police originally said  that of the 30 injured, 25 were in a critical condition while the other five were classed as stable but serious. White Island volcano: Why skin is being imported Mr Nash explained the injuries to the survivors were so severe that some of them were unable to identify themselves. ""There are a number of people in hospital who cannot communicate, they have significant burns not only to skin but internal organs,"" he told Radio New Zealand. ""We wish them the best but we're not out of the woods yet, of that there's no doubt."" Dr Peter Watson, chief medical officer at New Zealand's National Burns Unit, said an estimated 1.2m sq cm of replacement skin would be needed for the patients. An order has been placed from the US. Several patients would be transferred to Australia by the Australian Defence Force using an intensive-care acceptable aircraft in the next 24-48 hours, Dr Watson said. Analysis by James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent Donated skin is vital for helping to save the life of a major burns patient. Skin is our largest organ and its main job is keeping dangerous viruses and bacteria out. The damage caused by severe burns leaves patients at very high risk of infection. Donor skin is a short-term fix. It comes from dead organ donors - in the same way as hearts, kidneys and corneas - and can be banked for several years. The donor-skin aids healing, cuts the risk of infection and can reduce pain. The immune system is so weak after such an injury that rejection is not an issue. A single major burns patient needs a lot of donor skin. New Zealand is treating many at the same time and has needed to turn to other countries for help. New Zealand's chief coroner on Wednesday declared the eruption a ""mass fatality incident"". Officials said they are working with disaster specialists and forensic experts to identify the victims so their bodies can be returned to their families. There have been many tributes for the victims in the nearby port town New Zealand police have now listed nine people as officially missing,external- though they say this is a partial list as they have not been able to speak to all the next of kin. These are: Hayden Inman (New Zealand) Tipene Maangi (New Zealand) Julie Richards (Australia) Jessica Richards (Australia) Gavin Dallow (Australia) Zoe Hosking (Australia) Richard Elzer (Australia) Karla Matthews (Australia) Krystal Browitt (Australia) At least seven people on the list are believed to be dead or presumed dead, based on relatives talking to media. Tour guide Hayden Inman was identified as among the dead by his brother on Facebook. Julie Richards and her daughter Jessica from Brisbane, Australia, were identified as victims by a family spokesperson. In pictures: White Island eruption Adelaide father Gavin Dallow has been named as dead, with his stepdaughter Zoe Hosking presumed dead, according to media reports. Australian tourist Jason Griffiths, who was travelling with Karla Matthews and Richard Elzer, died in hospital on Wednesday. According to a statement released by their friends, both Karla and Richard are presumed dead. There is also a definitive list of all victims who are in hospital but police say they cannot release this for privacy reasons. This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" On Wednesday morning,geological agency GeoNet said,external""the level of volcanic tremor has significantly increased at the island"". Scientists view tremors, which result from a release of energy under the Earth's surface, as one sign of a possible eruption. In a later update, the agency said volcanic tremor, known as seismic activity,was now at the highest level seen since 2016,external. ""The level of volcanic tremor continues to rise and there is medium likelihood of future eruptive activity in the next 24 hours,"" the agency said. A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At a news conference on Wednesday, volcanologist Graham Leonard said seismic activity on White Island was escalating. ""Yesterday there was a high risk of an eruption,"" Mr Leonard said. ""Today there is an even higher risk of an eruption. And the parameters are worsening at the moment."" Police said the latest seismology update meant recovery teams had no choice but to wait, but they were on constant standby to return to the island as soon as possible. Police Minister Nash said there were also poisonous gases coming from the volcanic vent and that the island was blanketed in a thick layer of acidic ash. With measuring equipment on the island still intact, GeoNet can give regular updates on the situation, allowing police to assess the risk of sending recovery teams. Reconnaissance flights have shown no signs of life on the island and officials believe there are no survivors among the missing. Police said a drone conducted four fly-overs of the island on Wednesday, and analysis of that footage was ongoing. Are you in the area?

"Parent school donations 'exacerbating inequality'In 2017-18, the average school in London raised Â£43,000 from donations. In Yorkshire, it was about Â£13,300.Family & Education","Some schools say they need donations for ""necessities"", such as books Pupils in some of the poorest regions of England are losing out because parents cannot afford to fill a funding shortfall with donations, BBC News has found. In 2017-18, the average school in London raised Â£43,000 from donations. In Yorkshire, it was just Â£13,300. The Fair Education Alliance said this gap ""exacerbates unfairness between rich and poor"". The main political parties have all pledged to improve school funding. Money is often brought in through fundraising events, such as this mud run The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme's analysis of Department for Education data shows the average school in England generated Â£59 per pupil from donations in 2017-18 - 1.07% of its overall budget. The money is often raised through events, such as fun runs and school fairs. But there is a clear divide across the UK. While schools in London, the east of England (Â£24,585 per year) and the North West (Â£20,844) are the most likely to profit; those in Yorkshire (Â£13,288), the North East (Â£13,394) and East Midlands (Â£17,044) struggle. Individual schools also fare very differently. One school in Sunderland gained just Â£679 from donations, the equivalent of 43p per pupil, in 2017-18. At Westmoor Primary School - just outside Newcastle - fewer than 6% of pupils are eligible for free school meals. There, a recent muddy fun run raised Â£4,500 for pupils. While such events last year brought in Â£16,000 - or Â£45 per child. The money, head teacher Sharon Trundley says, will go towards ""necessities"", such as books. The school also has a set of iPads, ""which we wouldn't have been able to buy outright [otherwise]"", she adds. Its donations are below the national average but above par for the North East. In the north east, school donations are below the national average Some schools, like Hawthorn Primary, fare much worse. Based in Newcastle's city centre, nearly 50% of its pupils have free school meals. Last year its donations brought in just Â£1,200 - less than Â£5.50 per pupil. Head teacher Jane Dube says it is struggling with failing equipment such as outdated laptops. ""The parents we work with, the little they do have they need for their families and their homes,"" she said. ""They are incredibly generous with the school but we can't always expect that to happen."" It has just formed a parent teacher association to try to look for ways to bring in funding. Sam Butters, head of the Fair Education Alliance - a coalition of 150 organisations aimed at tackling perceived inequalities in the school system - said: ""The fact that parents in wealthier areas can afford to fill some of this funding gap exacerbates unfairness between rich and poor. ""We know that schools in all areas are cash-strapped as funding has decreased in real terms during the period of austerity, so it is not surprising that they are making efforts to seek funds from alternative sources. ""Teachers and school leaders are increasingly reporting a lack of funding for necessities - including, for example, teaching assistants to support in classrooms. ""If insufficient school funding requires donations from parents to meet shortfalls, schools in deprived areas are going to lose out."" Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in Junefound since 2009, spending had fallen by 8% per pupil once rising costs such as pay and pension contributions were taken into account. One head teacher in in south Londontold BBC News in Marchshe had had to scrub the toilets, clean the school and work in the canteen because of funding shortages. All five main parties in England have made pledges on education. Here are some of their key policies: The Conservatives have promised Â£7.1bn a year more for schools in England by 2022-23 Labour have pledged to provide free school meals to all primary school children and reduce class sizes to under 30 across all schools in England The Liberal Democrats have said they will recruit 20,000 more teachers and increase schools funding by Â£10.6bn a year by 2024-25 The Greens have outlined plans to increase school funding by at least Â£4bn a year The Brexit Party has said it will ensure all young people have the choice between a high-quality apprenticeship, setting up their own business or pursuing further or higher education Compare the party manifestoshere.

"UK ports 'preparing to host EU customs checks'Customs staff at UK ports could include EU representatives, the BBC has learned.","The shipping industry is drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland. The BBC has learned that freight could be diverted through ports with space for inspections such as Liverpool and Stranraer, despite the government denying checks will be necessary. Customs staff at the relevant ports could include EU representatives, under the details of the new withdrawal deal. The government said it has secured a ""great new deal."" There is also a proposal for smaller ""pop up labs"" at ports - mobile testing labs for health checks on food exports. There has been at least one meeting this month between officials and shippers to discuss suitable ports. One key issue is the diversion of freight to ports with enough capacity to process the freight traffic and carry out the necessary checks required by the Brexit deal. The Port of Liverpool has an existing Border Inspection Point for exports outside of the EU. Stranraer could be used to process checks for ships using the nearby Cairnryan port, which has limited space. Industry figures spoke to the BBC after leaks from within Whitehall clearly listed ""facilities for high levels of checks and controls"" as one of ""a number of challenges"" with delivering the PM's Brexit deal by December 2020. Despite claims by Boris Johnson that there will not be any checks on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, the industry is planning for them on the basis of the detail of the deal secured with the EU in October. One senior industry figure said that there was an ""implicit understanding"" that such checks for food products would be in Great Britain, partly because of sensitivities about new infrastructure representing a form of trade barrier within the UK. Reality check: Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge' Brexit: Where the parties stand on it The BBC also understands that EU officials suggested that the checks should be in Great Britain, to avoid having to send back foodstuffs not compliant with EU single market rules. The precise nature of the border checks depends on how aligned the UK remains with the EU, the decisions of the Joint Committee of the EU and the UK to be set up after Brexit, and whether UK authorities are willing to accept security and revenue risks in order to keep trade flowing. Technology could also help alleviate some of the checks. On Sunday the prime minister said there was ""no question"" NI/GB checks Paperwork and some checks will be required for agrifood imports into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, on the regulatory compliance of goods with the single market, and for trade tariffs for goods deemed to be at risk of being taken to the Republic of Ireland. Goods remaining in Northern Ireland should have their tariffs repaid by the UK government, but a system for this is yet to be implemented. The prime minister has also argued that only goods destined for the EU would face checks, but the industry says even verifying that would mean checking some intra-UK trade. Both the leaked memo from DExEU - the Department for Exiting the European Union - and a similar Treasury note last week confirm scepticism that the necessary changes to infrastructure are possible within the PM's self-imposed deadline of December 2020. The leaked DExEU memo suggests that work would have to start before negotiations on a future deal finish. ""The Prime Minister has been clear that the great new deal he has struck will not introduce new checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" the Conservative Party said in an email. ""We have struck a great new deal which will take the whole UK - including Northern Ireland - out of the EU and the EU's Customs Union.

WTO chief: 'Months' needed to fix disputes bodyThe system for resolving world trade disputes grinds to a halt after the US blocks any new WTO judges.Business,"Director General of the World Trade Organisation Roberto Azevedo says it will take ""a few months"" to fix its main body for settling trade disputes. It has ground to a halt because the US has blocked the appointment of new judges. A minimum of three are needed and today there is just one in place. The Appellate Body has the final say on disputes that cover billions of dollars of international trade and its decisions are supposed to be binding. However, now that it has ceased to function and can't take on new cases Mr Azevedo conceded that ""significant changes in the dispute settlement mechanism"" will be needed and that ""intensive consultations"" will start immediately. These are likely to include ""looking at issues like how fast can the disputes settlement work"", he said in a BBC interview The WTO's Appellate Body's been called ""probably the busiest international dispute settlement system in the world"" Those changes are being demanded by President Trump's administration in Washington. Their argument is that the WTO has treated the United States unfairly. Some of their criticisms are shared by other countries but others are not. Despite this Mr Azevedo says that Donald Trump's tenure as US president is not a barrier to reaching a solution. ""It's whether we can find fixes that everybody can live with"". He adds that, ""these are extremely complex conversations and negotiations and very political in nature, so we have to understand this is not something that is going to be solved overnight, just like that"". Trade disputes settlement system facing crisis Mr Trump's role is disputed by Professor James Bacchus, a former chairman, or chief judge, of the WTO Appellate Body as well as a former US trade negotiator. He told the BBC there is ""little chance of resolving this while Donald Trump is still president in a way that will continue to preserve the independence and impartiality of the Appellate Body and the rest of the WTO dispute settlement system"". He says that whilst the US has won the vast majority of cases it has bought at the WTO it has repeatedly violated the trade remedies imposed on it by the organisation. President Trump has denied that he would pull the US out of the WTO Professor Bacchus says that many of the US claims against the WTO are ""trumped up"". The US, however, thinks that the WTO dispute system interprets the WTO rules in a way that creates new obligations for WTO members,according to US ambassador to the WTO, Dennis Shea,external. One area that particularly grates in Washington is dumping, when a foreign supplier sells goods abroad more cheaply than at home. The US and others have used a disputed method for assessing whether goods have been dumped and how much the the price is below what it should be. It's not explicitly prohibited by the WTO rules, but the Appellate Body took the view that it was in effect against their spirit. Professor Bacchus says that immobilizing the WTO Appellate Body is an attempt by the US to replace the rule of law in trade ""with the rule of power"". Instead of turning to the WTO President Trump has repeatedly used tariffs to address his trade concerns, seeing them as a way to gain leverage over his adversaries. This has meant tit for tat tariffs against China in what is becoming a protracted trade war. They have also been used in disputes with countries including Brazil, Argentina, Turkey and the European Union. With the WTO paralysed, these other countries may now be tempted to lend their support to the EU plans for a new an alternative interim system for settling international trade disputes. China, the world's second biggest economy, is also now reported to be looking to support the move. In a statement the EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said the WTO's problems are a ""regrettable and very serious blow to the international rules-based trade system"".  And despite believing that a ""comprehensive package of reform"" is needed for the WTO he thinks it remains indispensable for ensuring open and fair trade. The WTO's Director General isn't concerned that any interim arrangement for settling disputes, however widely supported, will replaced his organization just 24 years after it was founded. Mr Azevedo says ""I think what we need to do is not lose focus on finding the permanent solution while at the same time we're working on some temporary fixes"".

Hundreds of fake McDonald's coffee stickers seizedSheets of counterfeit stickers were discovered in a man's car when he was pulled over in Bradford.,"Police searched the man's vehicle and found multiple sheets of fake coffee stickers A motorist stopped by police was found with hundreds of fake McDonald's coffee stickers in his car. The driver in Bradford was found with multiple sheets of stickers, similar to ones McDonald's customers are given when they buy hot drinks. Police said he was trying to defraud the loyalty scheme, in which six stickers can be exchanged for a free coffee. McDonald's said anyone with counterfeit stickers would be refused a free drink. The man was stopped on Westgate Hill Street on Sunday by the Steerside Enforcement Team, which deals with anti-social and criminal use of the roads in Bradford. West Yorkshire Police confirmed the driver was given a ""community resolution"" for fraud in relation to the stickers and also arrested on suspicion of drug-driving. He will be summonsed to court for the drug-driving offence. Writing on Twitter, the enforcement team said: ""It may seem inconsequential, but it is illegal to cheat a company like this. ""Just pay for your coffee!"" More stories across Yorkshire West Yorkshire Police shared a picture of the fake stickers on Twitter McDonald's customers get a sticker with a coffee bean on it every time they purchase a coffee.
