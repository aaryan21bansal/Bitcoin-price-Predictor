PM has not received any further fines - No 10,"Boris Johnson has not received any further fines for breaking lockdown rules, Downing Street has said. The confirmation comes after sources toldITV News,externalfines had been issued for a drinks party in the Downing Street garden attended by the PM in May 2020. Mr Johnson has previously apologised for attending the ""bring your own booze"" event, saying he ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event. Strict Covid rules were in place when the event was held on 20 May 2020. People could not leave their homes - or be outside the place they lived - without a reasonable excuse, which included work where you couldn't work from home. On the same day, the government Twitter account reminded people of the existing guidance that gatherings must be limited to two people outside. The BBC has not been able to confirm whether fixed penalty notices have been issued over the event. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson arrived back in the UK after a two-day trip to India, during which he played down the partygate row, saying voters wanted the government to ""focus on the issues on which we were elected"". Turbulent week puts PM's leadership back in frame A timeline of the lockdown parties What did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties? In January, Mr Johnson confirmed he had attended the garden party for 25 minutes to thank staff for their work, but said in hindsight he should have sent everyone back inside. The event came to light via a leaked email from Mr Johnson's then principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting people to ""make the most of the lovely weather"". The email was sent to a distribution list of around 100 people, and the BBC has been told about 30 people attended. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for breaching lockdown rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday in June 2020. All three apologised but Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak rejected calls to resign. The prime minister is known to have attended at least two more of the 12 events being investigated by Met Police - including the 20 May gathering - meaning he could be fined again. Asked during his trip to India whether he would still be in post by October - his target date for a trade deal with the country - he replied: ""Yes."" Boris Johnson might have hoped his trip to India would help shift the focus away from the partygate saga but if anything, things appear to have got worse for the prime minister while he's been away. He'll now face a parliamentary inquiry into whether he deliberately misled MPs in addition to the police investigation and Sue Gray report. There are signs too that support among his own backbenchers is slipping away rather than hardening. Steve Baker, a former Johnson-backer who's now had enough, predicts in an interview with the Telegraph that the Conservatives will ""reap the whirlwind"" of partygate at the forthcoming local elections. Repeated calls to resign from opposition parties won't change the prime minister's fate, but the actions of his own MPs could do. And many of them are waiting for those local election results and to see whether further fines come the prime minister's way before making up their minds about his position. Mr Johnson now faces an investigation by the Commons privileges committee, after MPs gave it the go-ahead on Thursday. No 10 initially tried to delay a vote on approving the inquiry, but later backed down in the face of unease among Tory backbenchers. The committee will determine whether Mr Johnson misled MPs by telling them Covid rules were followed in No 10 - a charge regarded as a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook.

"Rees-Mogg empty desk note insulting, says union","Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has been criticised for leaving a note for civil servants, saying ""sorry you were out when I visited"". The note, printed on government paper with Mr Rees-Mogg's title, was left at empty desks and read ""I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon."" Mr Rees-Mogg has said all civil servants must stop working from home. FDA union boss Dave Penman said the note was crass and insulting, and undermined civil service leadership. A source close to Mr Rees-Mogg confirmed the note, which has been widely shared on social media, was genuine. The note, which was signed off by the Cabinet Office minister ""with every good wish"", was left in a ""completely empty"" office, the source said. The source added that it was ""very important for the taxpayer and British public that government is working properly and the estate is well used"". Allow Twitter content?

FDA General Secretary Dave Penman said civil servants were planning to leave because of a renewed effort to have them working from Whitehall. ""Day after day we have good people telling us they will go because they know this is not about effective working practices,"" he said. ""They know it's a culture war that some ministers think plays well with their base. ""These notes from JRM are not only condescending, crass and insulting, they completely undermine the leadership of the service."" Liberal Democrat MP Helen Morgan also condemned Mr Rees-Mogg's actions in a tweet, saying: ""What a pointless nasty gesture."" Former Conservative MP David Gauke said the Cabinet Secretary ""really needs to have a word"" with Mr Rees-Mogg over the note. ""Not convinced this will get the best out of civil servants,"" Mr Gauke said in a tweet. The BBC has asked the Cabinet Secretary for a comment. Civil servants have been told to return to the office Earlier this week,civil servants were told they must stop working from home and return to the officeto ensure government buildings are at full capacity. Mr Rees-Mogg wrote to cabinet colleagues urging them to send a ""clear message"" to the civil service about returning. He also sent a league table of how many officials were at their desks on a daily basis this month, which shows in some departments daily average of staff in the workplace was lower than a third. Average daily attendance in the week of 4 April was 44%, figures show.

"UK to send Ukraine more military equipment, PM says","The UK has supplied next generation light anti-tank weapons to Ukraine The UK is to provide Ukraine with more military equipment, the prime minister has confirmed in a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Boris Johnson told Mr Zelensky more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent to Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Zelensky thanked the PM for the training of more than 20 Ukrainian troops who arrived in the UK last week. Ukraine was invaded by Russia two months ago this weekend. Mr Johnson also confirmed the UK would be reopening its embassy in Kyiv next week, a movefirst announced yesterday. The No 10 spokesman said this was a demonstration of ""our support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people"". The Ukrainian soldiers receiving training in the UK are being instructed on how to use 120 armoured vehicles that will be supplied to the resistance effort against Moscow, the government has said. Latest updates on the war in Ukraine Video appears to show children in Azovstal bunker President Zelensky updated Mr Johnson on the situation in the Donbas, where Russia has been concentrating its military efforts in recent days. Both leaders condemned ongoing attacks by Russian forces against civilian targets, including in Mariupol, Odessa and Lviv. Why Russia wants to seize the Donbas The prime minister told Mr Zelensky Russia would be held to account for its actions and that the UK government was helping to collect evidence of war crimes. He also updated the president on new UK sanctions against members of the Russian military, Downing Street said. The two leaders discussed how the UK would work with partners to develop a long-term security solution for Ukraine and spoke about discussions taking place with other nations and groups to provide further financial support, including at a G7 finance ministers' meeting last Wednesday. The two leaders met in Kyiv two weeks ago They also agreed on the importance of establishing a ceasefire and humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to leave the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The talks came as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had started attacking a steel plant in the battered port city, in an apparent bid to eliminate the last stand by Ukrainian defenders. An estimated 1,000 civilians remain sheltered in the Azovstal plant alongside the remaining 2,000 fighters. President Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin are both due to meet United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in the coming week, with the long-awaited prospect of a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave Mariupol expected to be on the agenda. In a news conference in a Kyiv metro station later on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said he was ""satisfied"" with the level of military support coming from the UK. ""We want more than we're being given, but we're satisfied,"" he told reporters. ""We cannot refuse or reject anything during the war from the biggest military aid, which is coming from the United States and the United Kingdom. ""There are many other friends in Europe, but I'm talking about volumes of help and I'm grateful for it.""

French vote as Macron aims to beat far-right Le Pen,"Marine Le Pen voted in her party's stronghold in the northern town of HÃ©nin-Beaumont French voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to give centrist Emmanuel Macron five more years as president or replace him with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. After a divisive election campaign, Ms Le Pen faces an uphill battle with her 44-year-old opponent polling ahead. In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round. But these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some 48.7 million people are eligible to take part and by midday (10:00 GMT) turnout was down on five years ago at 26.4%, but not as low as in the first round two weeks ago. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00. Marine Le Pen was first of the two candidates to vote, which she did in her stronghold in HÃ©nin-Beaumont. As she arrived, she sheltered a baby boy from the sun and told him: ""I will protect you."" Coraline was waiting in the sun with her baby LÃ©andre, when Marine Le Pen promised to protect him Mr Macron voted later in the northern resort of Le Touquet alongside his wife, Brigitte. He rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last. Emmanuel Macron voted with his wife Brigitte in Le Touquet, where she has a home The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout in parts of Paris appeared to be lower than usual. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration. On the eve of the election Mr Macron and his wife Brigitte took a stroll on the beach Whatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. The rising cost of living - described in France aspouvoir d'achator spending power - has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins. She has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era. She came top two weeks ago in La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, CÃ©cile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: ""Before Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm."" Fred is one of many voters in La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre who believe it is time for a change She will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: ""People can't afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I'm in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat."" African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds. There are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that. She has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a ""Europe of nations"" would tear the EU apart. Jean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and take drugs. This video can not be played WATCH: Voters react to the Macron and Le Pen TV debate MACRON V LE PEN:Two visions for France MACRON:From political outsider to president LE PEN:Long quest for power in France SIMPLE GUIDE:How the election works Across France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La FertÃ© too. First-time voter SÃ©rÃ©na sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a vital issue for France Apprentice accountant SÃ©rÃ©na, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: ""We don't really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now."" Nicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. ""I'm not so worried about her, more about the people behind her - her lieutenants."" Ms Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. He was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes. The town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a MÃ©lenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply. Outside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right's policies as racist. ""I'm going to vote blank,"" she says. It's a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all. Many MÃ©lenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. ""Macron is more for the rich than the poor,"" he says, before adding that he could still vote for him. Unemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and  abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires. When Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all. If the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.

Fury stops Whyte to retain WBC title,"Fury remains unbeaten in 33 bouts after flooring Whyte WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte and then insisted he will retire from boxing. Fury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut. Whyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted. ""This might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,"" Fury said post-fight. He added later: ""I've spent a lot of time on the road. I've been away for a long time. I fulfilled everything I've ever wanted to fulfil. ""I will retire as only the second heavyweight in history, after Rocky Marciano, to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game."" Fury - who also retained his Ring Magazine belt - is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte - suffering his third loss in 31 fights - fell short on his first attempt at a world title. If Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown - a fight which could potentially be staged later this year - and a chance to cement his status as Britain's greatest ever heavyweight. ""I promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,"" he added. ""But I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out."" Fury's wife Paris told BT Sport: ""I would like him to come out now. He has nothing more to prove. If he had anything left to do, I would say 'Yeah Tyson, you do it'. But he has nothing to prove. ""For Tyson to keep boxing, it just seems for one reason and I know in my heart, I think the only reason that Tyson will come back is for the unification fight."" The Gypsy King - end of an extraordinary era? Fight Talk - Social media reaction to big fight Recap - All the action as it happened Whyte had no answer to Fury's punching power With 94,000 fans in attendance - a post-war British record - there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history. Boos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring. Fury's ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean's 'American Pie', soon turned into 'Juicy' by Notorious B.I.G and ended on 'Sex on Fire' by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring. He towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte's dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round. It was then Fury's turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds. He landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at his opponent. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed. The contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury. The fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone. Whyte's telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease. Then came arguably Fury's greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut. Whyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue. Fury celebrates with wife Paris and his team This video can not be played 'There is nothing more I can do' - Tyson Fury on potential retirement Fury, as expected, took the microphone and treated fans to his own rendition of 'American Pie' in the ring following his victory. It was a singsong to end the perfect homecoming party for the Morecambe-based fighter, who was boxing in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2018. He said before the fight that this would be his last. That by boxing at Wembley he had reached his pinnacle. Many in the sport took those comments with a touch of scepticism - it is something he said several times before - but it seems Fury is sticking to his word. His compatriot Anthony Joshua is likely to rematch Ukraine's WBA, IBF and WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk this summer. The lure of fighting the winner for all the belts - and the lucrative nature it brings, particularly if Joshua is victorious - could just tempt Fury to halt his retirement plans. Tyson Fury made a dramatic entrance on a throne before facing Dillian Whyte If this is the end, however, it is a remarkable career from a man who at 6ft 9in and 19 stone has an ability to glide across the ring resembling an elegant ballroom dancer. His style, for his size, is unmatched. He is a boxer who went from narrowly beating John McDermott on points for the English title in Brentwood to becoming a unified world champion, shocking long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2015. A boxer who came back from over two and half years out of the sport and reclaimed a heavyweight title, cracking America and sharing arguably one of the greatest trilogies in the sport with Deontay Wilder. He has entertained reporters by dressing up as batman or taping his mouth shut at media conferences. Fury even had time to join the scripted world of professional wrestling. In the second coming of his career, Fury has spoken openly about - and become an advocate for - mental health struggles. But his career has not been short of controversy. Not long after his first world title, Fury made homophobic and sexist remarks during an interview. He previously tested positive for a banned steroid - something he blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar - and later admitted to use of drink and drugs to help deal with depression. More recently, his fight with Whyte had been somewhat overshadowed by Fury's links to Daniel Kinahan, who earlier this month was among seven people hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the United States. Fury had previously been advised by Kinahan but this week insisted he has ""absolutely zero"" involvement with the Irishman. It has been a career full of highs and lows. But despite the retirement, seeing the Gypsy King in a ring again - with potentially an opportunity to cement his status as the greatest British heavyweight in history - is wholly possible. Apart from the few months following his defeat to Alexander Povetkin in 2020, which he then avenged, 34-year-old Whyte had been mandatory challenger for the WBC belt since 2017. ""Dillian is a warrior and I believe he will be a world champion,"" Fury said as he and Whyte embraced post-fight. ""One of the greatest and, unfortunately, he had to fight me tonight. You are not messing with a mediocre heavyweight, you are messing with the best man on the planet."" Since his first career defeat to rival Joshua in 2015, Whyte has proven his world-level credentials with wins over the likes of Joseph Parker and Povetkin. He is still a big draw in the sport. ""There wasn't a lot in it - it was a close fight and I didn't feel like I was outclassed in there,"" Whyte told Radio 5 Live. ""My game plan was to press him and start moving forward. I was trying to attack but one slip and I got caught with the shot. ""He's a big awkward guy - I was expecting that. ""It was always going to be an awkward fight, but I was trying to set up and be patient and land what I could early and from round three onwards start to press. ""It was a good learning experience."" A rematch with rival Joshua, should he lose against Usyk, is easy to sell and one which could capture the imagination of boxing fans. Time will tell what the future has in store for Whyte, but the night belonged to Fury - one of, if not the greatest, British heavyweights of all time and a future hall-of-famer.

"UK to send Ukraine more military equipment, PM saysBoris Johnson tells Volodymyr Zelensky the UK will provide more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons.UK","The UK has supplied next generation light anti-tank weapons to Ukraine The UK is to provide Ukraine with more military equipment, the prime minister has confirmed in a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Boris Johnson told Mr Zelensky more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent to Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesman said. Mr Zelensky thanked the PM for the training of more than 20 Ukrainian troops who arrived in the UK last week. Ukraine was invaded by Russia two months ago this weekend. Mr Johnson also confirmed the UK would be reopening its embassy in Kyiv next week, a movefirst announced yesterday. The No 10 spokesman said this was a demonstration of ""our support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people"". The Ukrainian soldiers receiving training in the UK are being instructed on how to use 120 armoured vehicles that will be supplied to the resistance effort against Moscow, the government has said. Latest updates on the war in Ukraine Video appears to show children in Azovstal bunker President Zelensky updated Mr Johnson on the situation in the Donbas, where Russia has been concentrating its military efforts in recent days. Both leaders condemned ongoing attacks by Russian forces against civilian targets, including in Mariupol, Odessa and Lviv. Why Russia wants to seize the Donbas The prime minister told Mr Zelensky Russia would be held to account for its actions and that the UK government was helping to collect evidence of war crimes. He also updated the president on new UK sanctions against members of the Russian military, Downing Street said. The two leaders discussed how the UK would work with partners to develop a long-term security solution for Ukraine and spoke about discussions taking place with other nations and groups to provide further financial support, including at a G7 finance ministers' meeting last Wednesday. The two leaders met in Kyiv two weeks ago They also agreed on the importance of establishing a ceasefire and humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to leave the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The talks came as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had started attacking a steel plant in the battered port city, in an apparent bid to eliminate the last stand by Ukrainian defenders. An estimated 1,000 civilians remain sheltered in the Azovstal plant alongside the remaining 2,000 fighters. President Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin are both due to meet United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in the coming week, with the long-awaited prospect of a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave Mariupol expected to be on the agenda. In a news conference in a Kyiv metro station later on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said he was ""satisfied"" with the level of military support coming from the UK. ""We want more than we're being given, but we're satisfied,"" he told reporters. ""We cannot refuse or reject anything during the war from the biggest military aid, which is coming from the United States and the United Kingdom. ""There are many other friends in Europe, but I'm talking about volumes of help and I'm grateful for it.""

Farmers' anger over council's eat less meat email,"Farmers in Pembrokeshire have got beef with the council's eat less meat message Farmers have been left furious after a rural council called on staff to eat less meat. They want Pembrokeshire council to apologise after an internal newsletter urged staff to cut back on meat and dairy, saying a plant-based diet was healthier. The council said it was part of a series of tips on saving the planet. One of the county's many farmers, Charles George, of Wolf's Castle, called it a ""kick in the teeth"". ""They have got it completely wrong,"" he added. ""They should be out there encouraging people to eat local, to support local businesses, instead of having some vegan food that might have come from anywhere in the world."" Daffodils to treat Alzheimer's could be Welsh hill farming's future Deaths on farms more than double in a year Cold callers shock farmers with tree-plant plea NFU Cymru has called for a meeting with the council's chief executive. Farmer Charles George said the message was a ""bit of a kick in the teeth"" Pembrokeshire NFU vice-chairman Simon Davies said he reacted with disbelief to the memo and was disappointed by it. ""As farmers and as a union we work very hard as an industry to produce food of the highest quality and of the highest order,"" he said. ""My wish would be that Pembrokeshire council would endorse our products and instruct their families... to buy more locally-produced, locally-sourced products."" The note that sparked the row appeared in a staff newsletter Former Pembrokeshire council leader and independent councillor, John Davies, called the message ""a wrong one"". He said the council had shown a lack of respect and understanding and undermined the farming industry and should have only been urging people to cut down on meat and dairy bought ""from distant land"". He accused the council of undermining an industry that ""produces food that produces for the economy of Pembrokeshire"". ""It has done so not just in the last 100 years but for centuries and continues to do so at a time when other industries have arrived in Pembrokeshire and have disappeared from Pembrokeshire"". Pembrokeshire NFU vice-chairman Simon Davies said he was in ""disbelief"" at the memo Sioned Haf Thomas, who lives in Cardiff and is from Pembrokeshire, posts on Instagram about veganism. She said: ""I recognise that cutting out meat entirely is difficult, it's not easy. ""But every little change makes a difference, like cutting out meat. Even if it's a couple of meals a week without meat, then it reduces the environmental impact it has."" The Liberal Democrats said councils should not be ""trying to dictate what staff can and cannot eat"". Plaid Cymru said communities ""must redouble"" efforts to support local businesses and food producers in the face of the rising cost of living. Former Pembrokeshire council leader John Davies called the message ""a wrong one"" Samuel Kurtz, who is standing down as a Pembrokeshire county councillor this May and is the Welsh Conservative's rural affairs spokesman in the Senedd, said: ""What looks to have been a simple error has caused concern in the local farming community. ""Pembrokeshire is renowned for its fantastic agricultural produce, of high quality and sustainability, so the industry would expect support from the local authority."" The son of a Pembrokeshire beef farmer added all local authorities should be pushing a ""buy local"" message. Labour has also been approached for comment. The council said the newsletter was part of a series of tips for saving the planet, with details gathered from an external source. The statement was reproduced out of context and according to the authority, the newsletter is no longer shared. It said it was supportive of the rural community and agriculture.

Dover to Calais P&O ferry cleared to sail,"P&O Ferries services were suspended after the company sacked 800 workers The first P&O ferry that operates from Dover to Calais has been cleared to sail again. The Spirit of Britain had been detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). It has been conducting trial sails up and down the English coast between Dover and New Romney, a marine traffic website has shown. Safety fears were raised afterP&O replaced nearly 800 seafarers with cheaper agency staff last month. The marine traffic website, which shows the live positions of ships, reports the ferry's destinations as ""TRIALS"". P&O tweeted on Saturday morning that its services remain suspended. The MCA previously said the Spirit of Britain ""has been released from detention and can commence operations when P&O Ferries are ready"". The firm suspended most of its sailings but reportedly only expected the disruption to last up to 10 days. However inspections prevented a number of ferries from operating, which contributed to major travel disruption near Dover in the run-up to, and during the, Easter holidays. Dover queues 'worst seen since Christmas 2020' P&O Ferries preparing to restart Dover-Calais route Lorries carrying fresh meat in 24-hour Dover queues When the Spirit of Britain was detained earlier this month, P&O Ferries were told to fix a number of safety issues before a second inspection by the MCA. P&O operates four ferries across the English Channel between Dover and Calais. The Pride of Kent remains under the detention of the MCA and two other P&O ferries on this route have yet to be inspected. The removal of these four P&O ferries from service had a substantial impact on passenger and freight traffic, affecting both holidays and trade. The Easter holidays created a major bottleneck, as thousands of lorries queued to cross the channel alongside families going on holiday in Europe. There were also problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit. The last week has seen problems ease as holidays ended, which meant capacity has improved. Trade volumes are often lower in the week after a major bank holiday. The European Highlander, a P&O ferry that operates between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland, has been found to have a ""small number of deficiencies"" that need to be addressed before it can resume service, the MCA said. P&O currently has one ferry, the European Causeway, operating on this route between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Other ferries that have been inspected and cleared to sail by the MCA include the Pride of Hull, Norbay and the European Causeway. The Pride of Hull, which operates between Hull and Rotterdam; Norbay, which runs from Liverpool to Dublin; European Causeway (Larne - Cairnryan) and Spirit of Britain (Dover - Calais) have been inspected and cleared to sail by the MCA.

Post Office scandal victims wait for compensation,"Jo Hamilton says subpostmasters have lost everything and need full compensation A year since wrongful convictions of subpostmasters were first overturned, most say they are no closer to agreeing a financial compensation settlement. They were wrongly accused of theft and false accounting by the Post Office due to faulty software. One victim, Jo Hamilton, told the BBC: ""Subpostmasters have lost everything and they need it to be given back."" The Post Office said it wanted to provide ""full, fair and final settlements"". The case has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in legal history. The faulty software installed in the post offices made it look like money had been going missing from branches. Thirty nine individuals had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021, paving the way for more than 30 others to have their convictions overturned since then. Ms Hamilton, who had a criminal conviction hanging over her for 12 years, has told the BBC's Panorama programme that ""justice would be for everyone to be put back to where they would have been had none of this happened"". The Post Office has agreed to make interim payments of up to Â£100,000 to most of those who have had their convictions quashed. However, the solicitor representing many of the victims says his clients are still a long way from reaching any final settlements. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hears Neil Hudgell said the Post Office's proposed figures for damages are not adequate for his clients. As a result he is asking for more interim payments, and pressing the government and the Post Office to ensure cases are completed by end of this year as he believes subpostmasters are ""running out of time and money"". The government has already agreed to pay the entire bill for compensation as the Post Office's sole shareholder. The Post Office said: ""We want to provide full, fair and final settlements and are urging the government, who are the funders of the compensation, to help us reach agreement with the legal representatives of the postmasters and therefore be able to make payments as soon as possible."" But those individuals are not the only ones still waiting. There are more than 600 others who were prosecuted by the Post Office on the basis of Horizon software, with 33 individual cases currently being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in England and Wales, and nine in the same process in the Scottish legal system. Of more than 2,000 others who lost out financially because of the faulty Horizon software just over half have now received an offer of compensation. Of those 892 payments have been made totalling Â£7.1m, and 44 applications are now in a dispute resolution process because the offer was rejected. Hundreds of others are still waiting to hear if they qualify. Many of these individuals were dismissed from their jobs, and lost their businesses without ever being criminally prosecuted. Some 555 individuals who brought a civil case against the Post Office have also been locked out of compensation. That case forced the Post Office to admit the flaws in the software, and paved the way legally for much of what has followed, and yet most of their settlement was swallowed up in legal fees. Noel Thomas wants those in charge to feel some consequences Postal Affairs MinisterPaul Scully said last monththat those individuals would be given the same level of compensation as others, but has yet to publish details as to how that will happen. Nicola Arch is one of that group and is frustrated to still not have any answers. ""Our lives have been spent fighting all the time which is draining, especially when we have more fighting left to do it seems,"" she tweeted recently. A public inquiry into the scandal has spent the first two months hearing harrowing evidence from former subpostmasters in England and Wales, and will travel to Northern Ireland and Scotland in May to hear the human impact of the decisions taken by Post Office bosses. However, all victims are hoping that someone within government, the Post Office and Fujitsu, who made the Horizon software, will be held to account. But the calling of those witnesses will not get underway until the autumn, as the inquiry has announced another delay in its progress. Noel Thomas, who was wrongly jailed for nine months on a charge of false accounting, said he wants those in charge to feel some consequences. ""People in their position, being paid a lot of money, hiding the truth; make them feel like I felt when I lost everything overnight,"" he told Panorama. That celebration at the High Court last year marked a huge achievement for victims fighting a seemingly impossible battle, but it has certainly not been the end of the story.

Inquiry into oligarch who donated to royal hospital,"Viatcheslav Kantor, pictured with President Putin, donated to hospital used by the royals and Prince Charles's charity A Russian oligarch's charity, which donated to a private hospital used by the Queen and the Royal Family, has had its bank accounts frozen. The Charity Commission has launched an inquiry into the charities of Viateschlav Kantor, a billionaire sanctioned by the UK over Ukraine. Mr Kantor donated Â£9m to King Edward VII's Hospital in London. One of Prince Charles's charities, The Prince's Foundation, had also been promised Â£3m. The Russian-born billionaire had been made a ""life governor"" of the private hospital in Marylebone, of which the Queen is patron. But Mr Kantor has stepped down from that role and as a trustee of the hospital, which is known for its links to royalty. The King Edward VII recently opened the ""Kantor Medical Centre"", a new wing built with Mr Kantor's support, but in the wake of the sanctions, his name has been removed. â¢Queen's hospital donor on UK Russia sanctions list Police investigating Prince Charles charity What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Donations were paid through the Kantor Charitable Foundation, whose bank accounts have now been frozen by the charity regulator. The King Edward VII's private hospital is used by members of the Royal Family The Charity Commission inquiry will decide whether Mr Kantor's charities - the Kantor Charitable Foundation, the Kantor Foundation and the World Holocaust Forum Foundation - can continue to operate. ""We are committed to protecting the integrity of the charitable sector and are clear that an individual sanctioned in the UK cannot act as a trustee,"" said Tim Hopkins, Charity Commission assistant director. A King Edward VII's Hospital spokesman said: ""In the light of the difficult position [Mr Kantor] now finds himself in, he has decided to step back completely from all charitable activity in the UK."" The spokesman said the action was ""out of respect for the important and valuable work of the many charities he has supported"" and that Mr Kantor had agreed that his name would no longer be attached to these projects. Mr Kantor's charity also made donations to The Prince's Foundation, an education and training charity set up by the Prince of Wales. Charity records show Â£600,000 was paid to the foundation over two years, as part of a pledge for Â£3m, intended to be paid in stages until 2028. Mr Kantor's charity remains listed as a patron of the foundation. The Prince's Foundation says it won't comment on individual donations, but it is understood that donors would have been subject to a process of due diligence, based on what was known at the time. Among other causes supported by the sanctioned oligarch were the Thrombosis Research Institute, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Anna Freud Centre and the Royal Opera House. Earlier this month Mr Kantor was added to the list of oligarchs facing UK government sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Kantor was described by the UK government as the ""largest shareholder of fertiliser company Acron, with vital strategic significance for the Russian government"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said when announcing the further sanctions: ""We are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin's orders.""

P&O Cairnryan to Larne ferry stopped from sailing,"The European Highlander runs between Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway and Larne in County Antrim A P&O ferry that operates between Scotland and Northern Ireland must have a ""small number of deficiencies"" addressed before it can resume service. The European Highlander has been inspected by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). A second P&O ferry operating on the Cairnryan to Larne route, the European Causeway, was earlierdetained for two weeks over safety concerns. It sailed again on 9 April but with limited services. Safety fears were raised afterP&O replaced nearly 800 seafarers with cheaper agency staff last month. The firm suspended most of its sailings but reportedly only expected the disruption to last up to 10 days. Some services resumed on the Cairnryan to Larne route on 11 April. Dover to Calais P&O ferry cleared to sail P&O sacking is hammer blow to Scotland, says union Inspections also prevented a number of other ferries from operating. They included the Spirit of Britain on the busy Dover to Calais route,which has since been cleared to sail again. A spokesperson for the MCA said: ""The Spirit of Britain has been released from detention and can commence operations when P&O Ferries are ready. ""The inspection of the European Highlander is now complete; there are a small number of deficiencies and the MCA requires confirmation that these have been rectified before the vessel is free to resume service. ""There are no further inspections of P&O Ferries at the moment."" Other ferries that have been inspected and cleared to sail by the MCA include the Pride of Hull, which operates between Hull and Rotterdam; Norbay, which runs from Liverpool to Dublin.

The problem with CalMac's ageing ferries,"Repairs were carried out on the MV Caledonian Isles after an engine failure Announcements that Caledonian MacBrayne ferries have been withdrawn from service for repairs are becoming an increasingly common occurrence. Most islands in the west of Scotland rely on services from state-owned CalMac, which operates 34 vessels - the largest fleet in the UK. But CalMac has a problem - the pace of renewal has been slow and the ageing boats are developing more faults, leading to delays and cancellations. Four of the 10 largest ferries are beyond their expected operational life. The average age of the CalMac ferries is more than24 years and many of the large boats are even older. Of the 10 largest ferries, four are more than 30 years old and the MV Isle of Arran is 40. Three major ships - MV Caledonian Isles, MV Hebridean Isles and MV Clansman - were out of action in the spring of 2023 because of delays to repairs and annual overhauls. Even the newer ships have had breakdowns -  CalMac's biggest ship MV Loch Seaforth, built in 2014, was out of action for weeks in 2021 due to engine damage.  An investigation founda failure to replace piston screws,externalduring scheduled maintenance may have been to blame. Another fault developed in April this year, forcing it to be withdrawn from service from the main route to Lewis for two days. CalMac says its maintenance budget has risen by 67% over the past five years, with a projected spend of Â£34.2m in 2022. A spokeswoman for CalMac added: ""A long-term strategy to replace vessels and improve port infrastructure would improve the capacity we can offer to meet demand and increase resilience. ""Significant investments are being progressed by the Scottish government and its partners."" The Glen Sannox's construction at Ferguson's shipyard has been troubled The Scottish government's Transport Scotland agency has long known it needs to renew the CalMac fleet - but those ambitions have foundered, in part at least, due tothe Ferguson ferry fiasco. Back in 2012, a ferries plan included a programme of vessel replacement. In 2014, tenders went out for two new large ships - one for the Arran route and the other destined for the ""Uig triangle"", serving Skye, North Uist and Harris. Those ships, Glen Sannox and the as yet un-named hull 802, are still under construction at the now-nationalised Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. The cost to the public purse has risen to 2.5 times the original Â£97m budget - and the first ship won't be handed over to CalMac until late 2023 at the earliest, more than five years late. An impression of one of new ferries being built for the Islay route A Â£105m order for the next two big ships - for the Islay route - has nowbeen signed with a Turkish shipyardand, if all goes to plan, they should be delivered in 2024/2025. The new ships will replace 37-year-old MV Hebridean Isles and allow the 11-year-old MV Finlaggan, to be redeployed. Two other ""Islay-class vessels"" have now been ordered from the same shipyard, destined for the Skye, Harris and North Uist routes. A replacement programme for seven smaller vessels has begun, and should go out to tender later in 2023. The Scottish government has promised Â£580m of investment in Scotland's ferry network over the next five years - about half of it for new ships - but some claim, given the scale of the problem, that's nowhere near enough. Privately-run Pentland Ferries has successfully used catamarans to and from Orkney for years While few dispute the need for new ferries, there is far less consensus on what type of vessels should be purchased. CalMac and CMAL, another government agency which owns the ships and harbours, have a reputation for choosing a certain type of vessel - large, sophisticated mono-hulled ships with capacity for the crew to sleep on board. Some island communities have suggested they would be better served by a greater number of smaller vessels, and that shore-based crews could boost their economies. Others have urged CMALto consider using catamarans,,externalarguing they require smaller engines yet can carry similar numbers of vehicles at a substantially lower cost. Privately-run Pentland Ferries has successfully used such ships to and from Orkney for years, and has recently replaced MV Pentalina with a new catamaran. The Mull and Iona Ferry Committee has urged Transport Scotland to buy MV Pentalina. This has been rejected, although leasing the ship as a temporary measure remains a possibility. CMAL's argument is that it needs to build long-lifespan ""quality"" ships, interchangeable between routes and capable of withstanding often harsh conditions. Having ship-based crews, it says, provides more robust staffing. And it insists it remains on the lookout for suitable second hand boats. One such vessel, a medium-sized Norwegian ferry now renamed MV Loch Frisa, has entered service on the Craignure to Oban route. In Denmark, fully-electric ferries are already sailing but only on relatively short routes One of the dilemmas facing Scotland's ferry network is that it needs to commit to new ships now that could be in service for decades - yet it is still unclear which future technology will win out. In Denmark, fully-electric ferries are already sailing but only on relatively short routes. A Norwegian ferry operator is now running a boat powered by liquid hydrogen. The troubled ships being still being built at Port Glasgow were meant to be ""green ferries"", using dual-fuel diesel and liquified natural gas (LNG) engines. But those ""green"" claims are questionable - LNG is still a fossil fuel, and it has to be imported from Qatar before being driven hundreds of miles from Kent to Scotland. For the new Islay ferries, CMAL has ditched LNG in favour of mainly diesel ships with ""fuel efficient hulls"" and some electric power options while manoeuvring in port. Islands like Iona are seeing visitor numbers pick up again The introduction of heavily-subsidised road equivalent tariffs - aligning fares with the cost of road travel - has increased ferry traffic over the past decade, with 5.7m passengers and nearly 1.5m vehicles being carried in 2019 before the pandemic. The past two years have seen a significant drop in numbers due to Covid restrictions but the ferry network is once again struggling to cope. The boost in numbers is good news for the islands in many ways but locals oftencomplain of trouble getting a booking. Residents on Mull have urged the government to considera system used for the Danish island of Samso,externalwhere are proportion of spaces are held back for locals, based on evidence of demand. A new ferries plan is being promised. Ministers are also currently considering Project Neptune - a review by consultants looking at the roles of Transport Scotland, CalMac and CMAL - to try to make the system work better. But like the metaphor about the time it takes to turn a tanker around, the problems facing CalMac's fleet are going to take a long time to fix.

Wildlife still recovering a year after Mournes fires,"Teams of firefighters from all over Northern Ireland worked to put out the flames The devastation from a deliberately-started fire can still be seen on the slopes of Slieve Donard, a year after the flames took hold. The firesraged for three days, lighting the night sky above Newcastle and destroying an area of heathland the size of 325 rugby pitches. Teams of firefighters from all over Northern Irelandjoined the battle against the flames. Where a river acted as a natural firebreak the difference is clear. One side is devoid of the ""mature heather and rich biodiversity"" that Cormac Dolan would expect to see. ""You're looking for more of a mosaic of vegetation in the ground, whereas here you've just got purple moor grass coming back so far, a year on from the fire,"" the National Trust wildfire recovery ranger said. He is part of a team involved in helping the mountain recover. This video can not be played Rangers say Slieve Donard's landscape may take many years to fully recover With funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), surveys are being done on the wildlife that lives here, as well as management of the faster-growing species, to give other plants time to return. ""Following the fire, you lose the ecological balance,"" Marc Vinas said, who is the lead ranger in the Wildfire Recovery Project. ""And then you have some species that respond quickly. ""Purple moor grass grows very well on the lowland areas of the mountain and has responded quicker than the heathland and the heather. ""That's why we see that yellowy colour, because it is getting dominant."" Marc Vinas is part of the Wildlife Recovery Project That has an impact on wildlife as well. Birds like the meadow pipit and skylark use the heather for nesting, and it is also a source of food for the red grouse. But it is a slow-growing plant, and those bird species are fewer in number this year than before. In pictures: Fires on the slopes of Slieve Donard ""The heather at the minute is at a stage called 'pioneer heather',"" Marc said. ""This is going to be for 10 years, if the burn was not deep that heather will be recovering from the roots. ""It will take 10 years just to get that base of heather back.  And in 15 or 20 years, it will reach the mature stage. But this is not the end. ""After that it will start to die and open to give room to the sunlight to reach the ground again.  Then the mosses and other wildflowers will be thriving under that."" Bird species are fewer in number than they were before Grazing livestock on the mountain helped control the faster-growing species, and how that is done is part of the work the rangers are carrying out to allow nature to recover. ""We have to compartmentalise the area, that is not easy because we cannot create fences,"" Marc said. ""At the minute we are creating a plan using innovative technologies that have been used in other properties in the National Trust in England and Wales, with GPS technology. ""It uses a very low-intensity pulse that tells the animal where it can graze, so you don't need to build a physical fence. ""Depending on the grazing results onsite, we can just send them to different areas to improve the condition of the habitat, breaking that dominance of purple moor grass."" Butterflies are being monitored by rangers There have been more fires on the Mournes this year already. But there is still birdsong in the air, and the numbers of butterflies and lizards on the mountain are being monitored by the rangers. It will be a long, slow process. ""What we want is to reach as much as possible the maximum biodiversity as we had before,"" Marc said. ""Something that happened in days, we lost years of building that habitat. ""That habitat will take decades just to get back to what it was before. ""We'll make sure that that upland wildlife will be coming back to those recovering grounds in the Mournes.""
