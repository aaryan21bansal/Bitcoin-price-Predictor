Teenagers start to cash-in Child Trust Funds,"Millions of people turning 18 from now will be able to withdraw money from Child Trust Funds for the first time. Children born from September 2002 were given vouchers by the government to invest for the future, with the money only accessible at the age of 18. The savings pots could now be worth more than Â£1,000, or more if parents added contributions. However, many thousands of young people may have no idea these savings exist in their name. Child Trust Funds were set up by the Labour government to encourage parents to save for their children. The idea was for children to have some savings at the age of 18, to assist with costs such as further education funding or living alone for the first time. The government initially put Â£250 into the tax-free account during a child's first year, then added another Â£250 when he or she reached the age of seven. For lower-income families, the payment was Â£500. Parents, family and friends could also contribute to the account, up to set limits. The scheme was watered down, then scrapped entirely by the coalition government in January 2011. The first recipients of Child Trust Fund vouchers will now be turning 18 and can access the money for the first time. Each month about 55,000 people turn 18, and eventually a total of about 6.3 million people will be able to redeem the money, or continue to save, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Teenagers can actually take control of their account from the age of 16, but can only withdraw money from it from 18. For those who do nothing, the Child Trust Fund provider will move it into an Individual Savings Account, which is also tax-free, or roll it into another account with similar benefits. Kerry McWalter was surprised about the windfall Kerry McWalter is turning 18 in two weeks and will have access to a Child Trust Fund worth Â£1,400. She is just about to start a pharmacy studies course in Edinburgh, and said she would use the money for living costs and a future holiday as well as saving some of it. She found out about the possibility of a fund while looking on social media and used The Share Foundation's tracing service. ""When I found out, I was quite surprised. I wasn't aware I had one. My mum had forgotten about it,"" she said. She then told a close friend, who discovered she had a similar level of savings that she had no idea about. This money has often been in accounts where it is invested in shares. The success of those shares over time will determine their value, as will the original value of the government voucher. Accountants estimate that with the maximum parental contribution over the years, and investment growth, the fund could be worth as much as Â£70,000. A more realistic scenario for many people is that the money has sat untouched in accounts over the years. Even then, those born into low-income families are likely to receive a windfall of around Â£1,500. Parents were invited to open a Child Trust Fund with one of a number of providers within a year of their child being born. About 4.5 million were set up by parents or guardians. Children in care had accounts set up by local authorities and these are now managed by The Share Foundation - a charity which is also helping people to track down their funds. In 1.8 million cases when parents did nothing, the accounts were set up automatically by the UK's tax authority. HMRC admits that in potentially many thousands of cases, youngsters have no idea that they have such savings. Child Trust Fundscan be found using the Government Gateway service,external, which requires a login or registration. The Child Trust Fund unique reference number, or national insurance number is also needed. The Share Foundation charity runsa free finding service,external. Moreinformation on Child Trust Funds,externalis available on through the government-backed Money and Pensions Service. Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""We want to make sure all young people can access the money which has been set aside for them, to invest in their future and continue a savings habit, as they turn 18. ""If you're unsure if you have an account or where it may be, it's easy to track down your provider online."" When accessed there are a range of options for teenagers to consider. ""Getting a windfall like this can be daunting,"" said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at financial firm Willis Owen. ""There are lots of options to consider when it comes to how to use the money. Some may want to spend it, and others may want to invest it to make more money for their futures.""

Eight fined and arrests made after illegal rave,"An estimated 3,000 people were at the event in the Dulais Valley in Neath Port Talbot Eight people have now been fined up to Â£10,000 after an illegal rave that attracted 3,000 people, with arrests also made for public order offences and driving under the influence of drugs. Theunlicensed event at Banwen, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, started Saturday night. There were still 400 people at the site on Monday morning. South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Dave Thorne said drone footage would help identify organisers. Officers believe 22 people were involved in planning the rave. A student who attended the rave admitted being taken aback by the scale of the event and likened it to a festival. Mr Thorne said it ""caught us unaware"" but officers were quickly deployed after calls were received. Banwen rave organisers fined Â£10,000 Illegal rave organisers in Wales face tougher penalties He added: ""It is 4,000 acres, a significant sized area, where there was an opencast mine but it is now forested. ""It is now generally used for rally driving, so you can understand how hostile the land is - and large. ""We used drones to try and picture where everyone was."" Villagers in Banwen complained about noise through Saturday night into Sunday He described a police helicopter and specialist officers sent to the event, with assistance from Dyfed-Powys Police and British Transport Police. There were ""a few arrests"" he said, for public order offences, such as urinating in the street and drug taking. Eight people have also been issued with fines of up to Â£10,000,under new legislation introduced by the Welsh Governmentlast week to stop gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Vehicles have also been seized, and Mr Thorne said drone footage would be studied to try and identify the organisers. Police think ravers travelled from across the UK to the illegal event in Banwen He said the 400 people still there on Monday morning would be prosecuted if they did not leave by the end of the day. ""I'd like to appeal to those who have organised it to take a level of personal responsibility,"" he added. ""Local communities have been trying really hard to adhere to coronavirus rules and to have 3,000 people come in and not adhere to it, is really irresponsible."" A girl who attended described there being a festival feel to the event Niamh, a student from Cardiff who attended, said she made a last minute decision to go and admitted being ""taken aback"" by the size of it ""Of course there's that level of feeling bad for the people around there, and I did, but I didn't understand until I went there how big it was,"" she said. ""It was more of a festival, spread across a good few acres of land."" While she said she understood why people would think it was selfish, she said she had a mask on, social distanced and had hand sanitiser. She added: ""If older people are allowed to sit in their garden with friends, go for dinner, go into shops, where you're still interacting with a lot of people, what's the difference with people socially distancing and having a dance in a forest outdoors? ""I think there's a lot of stigma around young people doing their version of socialising just because it's not the same as you going for dinner or into the shops in town, where you're around just as many people one metre apart. What's the difference with doing that outdoors in the woods?"" Niamh said the words ""illegal rave"" conjured images of ""a bunch of crazy people breaking the rules"", but she said: ""It was a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone was being as safe as they possibly could.""

Sturgeon 'concerned' over 160 new virus cases,"This video can not be played Coronavirus in Scotland: No 'one-size-fits-all approach' for local lockdowns Nicola Sturgeon has voiced concerns after 160 more people tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland. The latest increase in new cases follows123 reported on Sunday, with a number of ""clusters"" across Scotland. The first minister said the rise in cases was ""partly the result of a greater number of people being tested"". But she said it was ""undoubtedly a concern"" and that any connection between cases was being ""carefully considered"" by health protection teams. A total of 69 of the new cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with Ms Sturgeon saying ""particularly close attention"" was being paid to this. However, she stressed that the positive results ""still represent less than 1% of people newly tested yesterday"". The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased to 258, five of whom are in intensive care. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The first minister said it appeared the figures in the Glasgow area ""seem to reflect a number of small clusters, rather than one or two more significant outbreaks"". She said ministers would consider whether any targeted action would be needed in the area, although she stressed that this might not necessarily mean a local lockdown - noting that ""lockdown increasingly means different things in different circumstances"". Another 27 cases were reported in Lanarkshire, 18 in Lothian, and eight in Ayrshire and Arran - with Ms Sturgeon warning that the latter ""seem to be linked to indoor gatherings"". However, there were just four new cases in the Grampian area, with Ms Sturgeon saying this was ""further indication that the Aberdeen pub cluster is contained"". Swimming pools are now able to reopen to the public The first minister said the fact that the number of cases reflected an increase in tests was ""an important bit of context to keep in mind"". But she added: ""The number is a reminder to all of us that the virus is still a very real risk, it is a development that concerns me and it is one we are taking seriously."" The increase in cases comes as the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in Scotland comes into force, withgyms and swimming pools reopening. Ms Sturgeon said: ""As we release ourselves from lockdown, we release the virus from lockdown too. ""Please follow the guidance - that's the only way we can make sure these reopenings can happen safely, and they don't spark an increase in transmission that could take us all back again. ""The figures demonstrate very clearly that this virus is still present across the country. The clusters we have seen show it will spread very rapidly if it gets the chance, and the admissions to intensive care last week remind us that the virus is still immensely dangerous for some people.""

Simon Case, who was made permanent secretary at 10 Downing Street earlier this year, is expected to be announced as cabinet secretary on Tuesday. The PM will reveal the appointment at a cabinet meeting, sources told the BBC. First reported by the FT,external, it comes after Sir Mark Sedwillquit the rolefollowing reports of tensions between him and members of the PM's team. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""An official announcement on the new cabinet secretary will be made on Tuesday 1 September."" Mr Case, 41, has been a civil servant since 2006. He spent almost two years working as Prince William's right-hand man before temporarily moving to Number 10 earlier this year to assist with the coronavirus response. His expected promotion to cabinet secretary comes two months after Sir Mark announced he was planning to step down from the role. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sir Mark said it was the right time to go as the government moved to the next phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. As cabinet secretary, Sir Mark advised Mr Johnson on implementing policy and the conduct of government. The new appointment also comes within the wider context of a ""fairly radical shake-up"" of the civil service, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said. This year has seen a number of senior civil servants in various departments unexpectedly announce they are leaving their posts. Jonathan Slater, the chief civil servant at the Department for Education, wassacked earlier this monthfollowing the row over A-level and GCSE results in England.

Biden accuses 'weak' Trump of sowing chaos,"This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames"" US presidential candidate Joe Biden has accused Donald Trump of being a ""weak"" and ""toxic"" leader who has ""fomented"" violence in the country. Speaking in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Mr Biden said the US was facing multiple crises, which ""under Donald Trump, keep multiplying"". The Democrat's comments came amid sharp tensions between the rival candidates over unrest in US cities. Mr Trump has made ""law and order"" a major theme of his campaign. The two candidates have in recent days been trading insults over clashes in Portland, Oregon. On Monday, police identifiedthe man who was fatally shot during Saturday's unrestas Aaron Danielson. His death was mourned by the far-right group Patriot Prayer, which described him as ""a good friend and a supporter"". Police have not specified whether the shooting was directly linked to the clashes between a pro-Trump rally and Black Lives Matter protesters in the city. However, media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over Danielson's death. Portland has become a flashpoint for demonstrations against police brutality and racism since the police killing of African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May triggered a wave of national and international outrage. Mr Trump is set to visit the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday amid anger there over thepolice shooting of black man Jacob Blake. A teenager has been charged with killing two protesters during the unrest last week. His lawyers said he would fight the charges on the grounds of self-defence. This video can not be played The scene following the shooting of Aaron Danielson in Portland on 29 August In his speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, Mr Biden said the president ""long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country"". ""He can't stop the violence - because for years he has fomented it,"" he said, adding: ""We need justice in America. And we need safety in America. We are facing multiple crises - crises that, under Donald Trump, keep multiplying."" ""Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?"" he asked. Mr Trump has sought to project himself as the law and order candidate in November's election, and says it is the Democrats and Mr Biden who are soft on crime and on the violence that has sometimes flared at anti-racism protests. Reacting to Monday's speech, he accused Mr Biden of ""blaming the police"" for protests and violence in the country. ""Just watched what Biden had to say,"" he wrote on twitter. ""To me, he's blaming the Police far more than he's blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie [Sanders] supports!"" In a tweet earlier on Monday, Mr Trump said ""Radical Left Mayors & Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their 'Movement'."" Mr Biden ridiculed Mr Trump for linking him to the violence, asking in his speech on Monday:  ""Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really?"" He also condemned the violence that has sometimes accompanied the racial justice protests, saying he had personally spoken with the families of George Floyd and Jacob Blake who told him ""none of this violence respects or honours"" them. The Democratic candidate called Mr Trump ""an incumbent president who sows chaos rather than provides order"" and a ""toxic presence on our nation...poisoning our very democracy."" The Biden campaign's main line of attack has thus far been focused on the White House's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and on the fact thatmore than 180,000 people in the US have so far diedwith Covid-19. But Monday's speech is being seen as an attempt to fight Mr Trump's law and order message head-on by directly questioning his record on public safety. Mr Biden's visit to Pennsylvania - an important swing state - marked an unusual trip for the Democratic candidate, who has worked mostly from near his home since coronavirus began spreading widely in March. He has a stable lead over Mr Trump in the national polls. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes The speech comes amid increasing partisan tensions over the recent unrest in Portland. Mr Trump has blamed Portland's Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler for violence in the city, and suggested that he will send in federal forces. As he threatened to intervene in Portland, Mr Trump on Monday tweeted that if he ""didn't INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now"". Violence broke out in Kenosha last week after Mr Blake was shot seven times in the back. His lawyers say he has been paralysed by the shooting. A 17-year-old has been chargedwith killing two people during the subsequent unrest. Kyle Rittenhouse had told journalists it was ""his job"" to guard buildings in Kenosha against protesters. Videos on social media showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire at them. The White House on Monday dismissed recent comments from Kellyanne Conway, Mr Trump's former adviser, that the president was benefiting politically from unrest in the country. ""The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law and order,"" Ms Conway told Fox News last week. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Mr Trump was ""not rooting for more violence in the slightest"".

Trump defends supporters accused in deadly clashes,"This video can not be played President Trump declines to condemn his supporters for their role in recent deadly street clashes US President Donald Trump has defended supporters for their alleged roles in recent deadly street clashes. He suggested a teen accused of killing two in Wisconsin last week and Trump fans involved in clashes in Oregon on Saturday had acted in self-defence. He said Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in the 3 November election, had not specifically disavowed far-left activists accused of civil disorder. The violence has come amid widespread, largely peaceful anti-racism protests. Has Trump delivered on his promises? Where Trump stands on key issues Mr Biden, leading in opinion polls ahead of the election, has spoken out against violence, accusing Mr Trump of causing the divisions that have stoked it. At Monday's White House news conference, Mr Trump blamed Mr Biden and his allies for violence in cities run by Democratic mayors and governors. A CNN reporter asked the Republican president whether he would condemn Trump supporters who had fired paint pellets during a confrontation with counter-protesters at the weekend in Portland, Oregon. In the ensuing street clashes, Aaron Danielson - a member of a far right group, Patriot Prayer - was killed by a suspect who has reportedly described himself as a member of antifa, a network of mainly far-left activists. Mr Trump described the protest as ""peaceful"" and said paint was ""a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets"". He told the reporter: ""Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman who - and killed him, not with paint but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful."" Another reporter asked Mr Trump whether he would condemn a shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, allegedly by a teenager once pictured at one of the president's rallies. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, is accused of shooting three people, two fatally, last week amid demonstrations in the city over the police shooting of an African American man, Jacob Blake. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? ""We're looking at all of that,"" Mr Trump said in his first public comments about the suspect who was seen on video being pursued down a street and firing a weapon. ""That was an interesting situation, you saw the same tape as I saw, and he was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. ""And it was something that we're looking at right now, and it's under investigation. ""I guess he was in very big trouble, he probably would have been killed."" Two Democratic congressmen pilloried Mr Trump for the remarks. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts tweeted: ""This is the United States President justifying a double murder by a white man illegally carrying an assault rifle across state lines."" Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged as an adult, has not yet been brought to trial. Representative Eric Swalwell of California tweeted that the president had just made Republicans ""the Mass Shooter Party"". This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames"" Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Kenosha Throughout the summer, President Trump has referred to those taking to the streets across America as looters, rioters, anarchists and thugs.  That is even though most of the demonstrations calling for an end to racial injustice, and to police brutality, have been peaceful. But just as Democrats accuse the president of exploiting and even stoking the unrest for political gain, so Donald Trump's supporters accuse Democrats of the same thing. ""Our mayor is a Democrat, the governor is a Democrat, and the fact that they refused help early on just shows me that they were playing politics,"" one Trump supporter in Kenosha told me this evening. In fact, the Wisconsin governor called in the National Guard the day after Jacob Blake was shot by a police officer in the city. But with the aggressive messaging on law and order coming from the White House, the battle lines have been drawn on this issue - one we will be hearing much more of over the next nine weeks. Earlier on Monday, Mr Biden forcefully condemned the violence at recent protests while accusing President Trump of making the country unsafe. It was the Democratic nominee's most determined effort yet to counter Republican criticism that he was weak on law and order. ""Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?"" said Mr Biden, speaking in Pittsburgh, in the critical US election state of Pennsylvania. ""Really?"" The former US vice-president accused Mr Trump of having fomented violence in the US for years. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career ""You know,"" said Mr Biden, ""he may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is."" ""Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?"" he asked. The Democratic nominee took no questions from the media. Mr Biden's remarks represented a pivot from his main line of attack so far - that the White House has mishandled its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 180,000 people in the US. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes Mr Biden spoke out against violent protests a number of times between May and July,according to a Washington Post fact-check,external. Democrats hardly touched on the issue during their convention from 17-20 August, focusing instead on racial justice and African-American victims of police brutality. Rioting and looting was a central theme of the Republican convention a week later. Since the shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin on 23 August reignited civil strife, Mr Biden and his campaign have renewed their criticism of violence at demonstrations. According to the Associated Press news agency, Mr Biden has been prodded by anxious Democrats - including within his campaign - to be more vocal in denouncing protest-related violence. Research by Marquette University Law School,externalin Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 11 August found support for the racial justice protests has fallen 13 percentage points, and for Black Lives Matter by 10 points, from June to August. Wisconsin - which was pivotal in Mr Trump's against-all-odds election victory four years ago - is a must-win state for Democrats in November.

Zoom revenues skyrocket as profits double,"Popular videoconferencing app Zoom has seen its revenues skyrocket as second quarter profits more than doubled due to the coronavirus crisis. Revenues leaped 355% to $663.5m (Â£496.3m) for the three months ending 31 July, beating analysts' expectations of $500.5m. Profits soared to $186m, while customer growth rose 458%, compared with the same period in 2019. Video conferencing apps remain crucial due to the increase in remote working. Zoom's shares hit a record high on Monday, closing at $325.10, as the firm raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% to the range of $2.37bn-$2.39bn, from its previous projection of $1.78bn-$1.80bn. Key to Zoom's success was its ability to add paying customers - high-budget corporate clients - as opposed to those who use its services for free. Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic Coronavirus: Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars The company said that its large customers - firms that generated more than $100,000 in revenue in the past year - doubled to 988 during the quarter. Zoom, together with rivals Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams, have all seen a surge in usage of their video conferencing platforms since coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed by multiple countries in March. But Zoom's soaring popularity has also strained its infrastructure, with some outages last week as schools in many parts of the US resumed classes virtually. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. Zoom has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use.

Former president of India dies after Covid diagnosis,"Pranab Mukherjee rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts as president India's former president Pranab Mukherjee has died 21 days after it was confirmed that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The 84-year-old was in hospital to remove a clot in his brain when it was discovered he also had Covid-19. Before serving as president between 2012 and 2017, Mr Mukherjee held several important portfolios during his 51-year political career. These included the finance, foreign and defence ministries. His son, Abhijit, confirmed the news in a tweet. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The job of president is largely ceremonial but becomes crucial when elections throw up fragmented mandates. The president decides which party or coalition can be invited to form a government. Mr Mukherjee didn't have to take such a decision because the mandate was clear during his presidency. But he showed his assertiveness in other decisions, such as rejecting the mercy petitions of several people who had been sentenced to death. Mr Mukherjee also served on the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Most of his career was with the Congress party which dominated Indian politics for decades before suffering two consecutive losses in 2014 and 2019 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Mukherjee joined the party in the 1960s during the tenure of then prime minister Indira Gandhi whom he had described as his mentor. In 1986 he fell out with the Congress leadership and started his own political party, but returned two years later. He regarded former PM Indira Gandhi as his mentor A parliamentarian for 37 years, Mr Mukherjee was widely known as a consensus-builder. Given that consecutive governments before 2014 were built on coalitions, this was an important and valued attribute. However, Mr Mukherjee's larger ambition - of becoming India's prime minister - was never realised. He was overlooked for the post twice - after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 and after his party's unexpected election win in 2004. Manmohan Singh, a trained economist who was chosen as the prime minister, later said that Mr Mukherjee had every reason to feel aggrieved. ""He was better qualified than I was to become the prime minister, but he also knew that I have no choice in the matter,"" Dr Singh said. Pranab Mukherjee was one of India's most astute politicians. As one of the leading figures of the Congress party, he held every key ministry in India - commerce, defence, external affairs and finance - over a chequered half- a-century-long political career. What the diminutive leader lacked as a politician with a mass base - he was mostly elected to the upper house of the parliament - he made up with his keen sense of realpolitik and formidable managerial skills. During the two-term Congress-led government which ended in 2014, Mr Mukherjee deftly negotiated the choppy waters of an unwieldy and often fractious coalition. He worked tirelessly at building consensus on a raft of rights-based legislations relating to matters like food security and right to information that helped his party gain political heft and popularity. His record as a finance minister in the second term was less stellar: the economy overheated, inflation peaked and interest rates went through the roof. Critics called him one of the ""worst"" finance ministers India ever had. As the 13th president of the republic, Mr Mukherjee walked a fine line, having good relations with his party's arch foe and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his own Congress party leaders. In many ways, he was a remarkable exception in the rough and tumble of Indian politics: a calm bipartisan leader and a dour consensus builder with an encyclopaedic memory. When Mr Mukherjee was appointed India's president in 2012, he was widely acknowledged as being the most experienced politician by far to take up the post. His tenure as president saw him reject up to 18 bills that were sent to him for assent. Presidents generally do not reject bills sent to them. He also rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts - the highest by far of any Indian president. As a result, Afzal Guru - convicted of involvement in the 2001 attack on India's parliament was hanged in February 2013. Yakub Memon, who was convicted of financing the 1993 terror attacks in Mumbai, and Ajmal Kasab, one of the gunmen in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, were also hanged during his tenure.

Channel swimmer rescued after eight-hour search,"The swimmer was found just 500m off the coast of Dover A lone man attempting to swim the English Channel from Dover to Calais has been rescued following an eight-hour search. The hunt was prompted by a call to the coastguard from a friend of the swimmer on Monday. A helicopter and lifeboats were launched as part of the rescue effort, and the man was eventually found by a boat just 500m off the coast of Dover. The swimmer was brought to shore and was described as ""cold and tired"". The rescue operation began just after midday. A coastguard spokesperson said: ""At around 12.10pm today HM Coastguard received a call from a member of the public with information that their friend was swimming unaccompanied to Calais from Dover. ""Coastguard rescue teams from Deal and Langdon, RNLI lifeboats from Dover and Dungness and coastguard search and rescue helicopters from Lydd and Lee-on-Solent were sent. ""Vessels in the area were asked to keep a sharp lookout and Kent Police, Dover Port Police and Dover Port were informed.

Fatal helicopter crash pilot 'will not fly again',"Four people lost their lives in the crash in 2013 The pilot of a helicopter which crashed off Shetland leaving four people dead will ""never fly again"" due to the trauma, an inquiry has heard. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, drowned after the crash. Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, got on to a life raft but died from heart failure. Pilot Martin Miglans said in a statement his ""world ended"". The four passengers were among 18 people who were on board the Super Puma when it crashed in 2013. The first day of the inquiry also heard that the helicopter's pilots did not notice their reducing airspeed until it was too late. An affidavit from pilot Mr Miglans was read out. He said he remembered coming out of cloud and seeing water. He said: ""Everything was wrong, it was all lost by then"". Mr Miglans said: ""That is my nightmare to this day. I remember the shock and horror of seeing the sea."" He added: ""I will never fly again."" He said he had been ""destroyed"" by the crash and has been told he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ""I do not want sympathy,"" he added. Super Puma FAI adjourned due to coronavirus Seven-year Super Puma FAI wait 'deplorable' In an interview recorded several days after the crash that was shown to the inquiry, he said he remembered thinking ""I am going to die, I am going to drown"". However, he managed to get out and get to the surface. ""You do the training but it's not a movie,"" he said. ""When it's real it's shocking to the core."" A joint minute of agreement at the start of the inquiry set out the sequence of events and loss of life. It said the helicopter had been descending into Sumburgh, but with speed reducing. When an alert sounded at 300ft the commander attempted recovery action but it was ""highly likely unrecoverable"", and the helicopter hit the water. Offshore steward Sarah Darnley and safety consultant George Allison were found in the water among debris. Post-mortem examinations revealed their causes of death as drowning. Production operative Duncan Munro, who also drowned, was found in the submerged fuselage still harnessed to his seat. Welder Gary McCrossan managed to escape to a life raft, but was then seen to suffer chest pains. Resuscitation efforts were made and he was winched on to a helicopter to be taken ashore, but could not be saved. Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle is presiding over the inquiry A post-mortem examination showed he had been suffering from heart disease, and that the cause of death had been cardiac enlargement. It was thought the stress caused by the crash would have acted as a trigger to the fatal cardiac event. Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) expert Philip Sleight, deputy chief inspector of air accidents, was the first witness. He said: ""The decreasing airspeed went unnoticed by the pilots until a very late stage, when the helicopter was in a critically low energy state. ""The commander's attempt to recover the situation were unsuccessful and the helicopter struck the surface of the sea. ""It rapidly filled with water and rolled inverted, but was kept afloat by the flotation bags which had deployed."" The investigation found the helicopter's flight instruments were ""not monitored effectively"" during the latter stages of the approach. This allowed the helicopter to enter a critically low energy state, from which recovery was ""not possible"". There was no evidence found of fault with the helicopter that caused or contributed to the crash. The inquiry was previously delayed due to coronavirus measures. Derek Pyle, Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, told the opening of the FAI that the inquiry was of added importance because it was the first virtual fact-finding hearing of such a size and scope in Scotland, and perhaps the UK. Surviving passengers are among those expected to give also evidence. The inquiry continues on Tuesday.

Face coverings in high schools rule comes in,"Secondary school pupils in Scotland should wear masks in corridors and when moving around the school building Pupils and staff now have to wear face coverings when moving about within Scotland's secondary schools. New rules came into force on Monday, which will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils and primary pupils aged over five. However, pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms. But where adults cannot keep a two-metre distance and are interacting face-to-face for more than 15 minutes, face coverings should be worn. Students at St Columba's High School, Gourock, wore protective face masks on Monday morning Announcing the new rules for schools last week, the Scottish government said while staff and students can continue to wear face coverings if they wish, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom as there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on learning and teaching. Education Secretary John Swinney said: ""There is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them. ""We also know that some pupils have found it very difficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus. ""And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between different age groups."" It can be difficult for pupils to socially distance when moving around in schools He added: ""We want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools."" Mr Swinney has stressed pupils will not be excluded from school if they do not wear a face covering. It follows advice from the World Health Organisation that children aged 12 and over should wear face masks. School pupil Heather told BBC Scotland she wishes she didn't have to wear a face covering but she understood why wearing them was important. ""I'd rather not wear it, but if it means keeping other people safe and myself safe then it really doesn't bother me,"" she said. Heather's mum works in a care home. She said she thinks wearing a mask helps keep her mum and the residents at her mum's home safe. ""It's the least I can do to help out,"" she added. She advised other pupils that they should ""just wear it and try to get on with your daily life"". ""You'll get used to it, it's just another precaution to stop you and other people from getting it."" Panalee said it was inconvenient to have to wear a mask sometimes, for example when her glasses steam up. But she said it was worth it because ""it keeps other people I care about safe"". The inconvenience is worth it, she added, if it can help reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted. DEATHS:Who is dying and where with Covid-19 in Scotland?

'Covidiots' criticised on Tui quarantine flight,"Nearly 200 passengers on a flight back from the Greek island of Zante have been told to self-isolate A flight from Zante which left nearly 200 people facing two weeks' self-isolation was a ""debacle"" and a ""free-for-all"", passengers say. One traveller said the Tui flight was full of ""covidiots"" and ""inept crew who couldn't care less"". Another claimed there ""wasn't much"" policing of rules. Sixteen passengers on flight TOM6215 from the Greek island to Cardiff have now tested positive. Tui said safety was a priority and it was concerned by the claims. ""Our crew are trained to the highest standards,"" the airline said. ""A full investigation is now under way as these concerns weren't reported during the flight or before today."" The 193 passengers and crew who were on board the flight on 25 August are being asked to self-isolate for a fortnight. Health officials said seven people from three different parties are believed to have been potentially infectious on board the aircraft. How to fly during a global pandemic What are the latest social distancing rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar told BBC Radio Wales people returning from Zante in particular are ""picking up the infection and are coming to our attention"". Greece and its islandsremain on the UK government's list of quarantine-exempt countries, meaning travellers do not need to self-isolate on their return. But the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated itstravel advice,externalfor Zante on 29 August to reflect local coronavirus restrictions put in place on the island. Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to self-isolate before they had even learned about the positive cases. ""This flight was a debacle. The chap next to me had his mask around his neck. Not only did the airline not pull him up on it, they gave him a free drink when he said he knew a member of the crew,"" Ms Whitfield said. ""Loads of people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others. ""As soon as the flight landed, a load of people took their masks off immediately. The flight was full of selfish 'covidiots' and an inept crew who couldn't care less."" Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to isolate for two weeks before learning about the positive cases Ms Whitfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on. ""But the vast majority of people weren't being spoken to, and there was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn't say anything to him [about the mask],"" she said. The couple have now sent off for a test as they are experiencing mild symptoms, she added. Victoria Webb is concerned she only found out about the outbreak from a media report Victoria Webb was also on the flight and said she only became aware of the outbreak when her mother sent her a link to the BBC News story as she travelled home to London from Cardiff. ""I was surprised and slightly at a loss as to what the best course of action was as I was mid-journey,"" she said. ""I spoke to the train manager who was concerned but professional and eventually, after some discussion with his head office, moved me to a carriage where I was alone for the remainder of the journey. ""We also swapped details so I could inform him when I had my test result back."" She has now quarantined in line with government advice, but said she has received no communication from health bodies, such as track and trace. ""The contact forms are there to be used and communication should be swift and thorough so we know process is being followed and can measure its effectiveness,"" she added Governmentguidance for airline passengers states it is mandatory,externalfor travellers in Wales, England and Scotland to wear face coverings on board aircraft, while they are recommended in Northern Ireland. Passengers should remain seated ""as much as possible"" and ""follow instructions and guidance from crew"", it adds. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) recommends mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew as one of several actions to reduce what it says is the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft. Additional measures proposed: Temperature screening of passengers, airport workers and travellers Boarding and alighting processes that reduce contact with other passengers or crew Limiting movement within the cabin during flight More frequent and deeper cabin cleaning Simplified catering procedures to lower crew movement and interaction with passengers Iata does not recommend restricting the use of the middle seat to create social distancing while onboard aircraft. Another passenger on the flight, Lee Evans, described chaotic scenes at Zante airport where he said staff members handled passengers' phones to check boarding passes. ""It was a free-for-all to get on the plane,"" he told the BBC. ""There were people switching seats."" Lee Evans said passengers were not keeping 2m apart at the gate before boarding the flight While the requirement to wear masks was reinforced on board, Mr Evans added: ""There wasn't much in terms of policing what customers were doing on the aeroplane."" He described an email telling him and his family to self-isolate - which came almost a week after the flight - as a ""shock"". ""Someone needs to be held to account,"" he said. Another passenger, who only wanted to be identified as Lewis, said he had flown 11 times in the last six weeks with various airlines and all other flights were fine except for the Tui one. ""The flight was poorly managed by Tui,"" he said. ""Tui did announce that it was a requirement that the masks where kept on. It was said about four times. ""We made cabin crew aware that people were constantly removing their mask. No cabin crew approached those people. I've not experienced that from any flight I have had elsewhere."" He said people responded to requests from staff to make it known if they thought they had symptoms - and those were moved to the front where the curtain was closed. ""There were used wipes in my seat pocket when I got on, so the plane wasn't as clean as they said,"" he added. ""We should have been told to isolate before we got off the plane. We only found out from the news that this had happened. ""Five days later, I can't tell you how many people I have had contact with."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Travel expert Simon Calder said he was concerned about the length of time taken to contact people. ""It's absolutely imperative that people follow the rules,"" he said. ""By way of mitigation, speaking for cabin crew in general rather than for Tui who say they've got an investigation in place, it's very tough to police a late evening flight from a party island like Ibiza - or in this case Zante. ""They have to have regard for their own safety. Add to that there are legal exemptions for mask-wearing and it all becomes quite complicated. ""But what really worries me is the timing of all this. It's six days since that flight landed. ""We're supposed to fill in passenger locator forms with all our details and one would assume that as soon as any case is identified Public Health Wales would be on the case with everybody rather than leaving the best part of a week."" Tui said in a statement on Monday: ""Passengers are informed prior to travel and via PA announcements on the flight that they have to wear masks throughout and are not allowed to move around the cabin. ""Masks can only be removed when consuming food and drink."" Dr Shankar, PHW's Covid-19 incident director, told BBC Breakfast that public health officials initially identified seven people who had tested positive and were potentially infectious on the flight. He said since they began alerting passengers, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 16, but it was unclear where they had contracted the virus. He said that any of the 187 passengers and six crew on board the three-and-a-half hour flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport on Tuesday that had symptoms ""should book a test without delay"". It comes as agroup of people from Plymouth tested positive for the virusafter returning from Zante last Monday. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? There were1,715 new coronavirus cases - and one death - reported in the UKon Sunday - the highest number of daily infections recorded since 4 June. Cardiff Airport, which is owned by the Welsh Government, said it was working closely with airlines to ""facilitate passenger travel throughout this challenging time for the industry"". Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? ""Tui is taking every necessary measure following today's report,"" said Spencer Birns, Cardiff Airport's interim chief executive. ""Cardiff Airport is closely following guidelines set out by Public Health Wales, FCO and UK government and has already taken a number of measures to ensure the safety and security of our team and customers, which is our number one priority.""

US tops six million coronavirus cases,"The US recorded one million new coronavirus infections in less than a month The US has now surpassed six million cases of Covid-19 - almost a quarter of the world's total, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. It said the country added one million new infections in less than a month. More than 183,000 people have now died. In the UK, France and Spain, the infection rate dropped compared with Sunday's figures - but the tallies may be readjusted later on. It comes as children across Europe prepare to return to schools this week. The total number of confirmed cases globally has now surpassed 25 million, with more than 846,000 Covid-19 related deaths. The true number of cases is likely to be significantly higher, because many people who have had the infection but did not show symptoms have not been tested. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the emergency authorisation of vaccines requires a ""great deal of seriousness and reflection"". The UN body's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said every country had the right to approve drugs without full trials, but it was ""not something that you do lightly"". The WHO says that 33 potential vaccines are currently up for clinical trials,,externaland a further 143 are in pre-clinical evaluation. On Monday,Johns Hopkins reported that there were now more than six million coronavirus cases across the US.,external The university - which has been collecting US and global coronavirus data since the outbreak began late last year in China - reported the first infection in America on 21 January.

Reading and Leeds Festival doubles main stages,"Stormzy, who has previously headlined Glastonbury, was due to perform at Reading and Leeds this year Reading and Leeds Festival will be back next year with six headliners split across two main stages in each site. The event, which sees acts rotate between Reading and Leeds, had been due to happen last weekend but was called off due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now 2021's headliners will be Stormzy, Liam Gallagher, Post Malone, Catfish And The Bottlemen, Disclosure and Queens Of The Stone Age. Up to 200,000 fans are expected at next year's events - from 27 to 29 August. Liam Gallagher seems pretty pleased to be back on stage next year The head of the event's promoters Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, said it was their ""most epic plan yet"". ""Two main stages, six headliners, the best line up of acts 2021 will see and 200,000 fans are going to celebrate the best music,"" he added. The event, regarded by many live music fans as second only to Glastonbury in the annual UK music calendar, will also include AJ Tracey, Doja Cat, Lewis Capaldi, Mabel and Two Door Cinema Club, along with rappers Ashnikko, DaBaby and Fever 333. Vale Earth Fair festival held in Covid-free Guernsey - BBC News Festival staff 'devastated' by summer of cancellations - BBC News Rapper Stormzy and former Oasis frontman Gallagher had been due to headline the 2020 events - along with rock band Rage Against The Machine - and the organisers were able to retain the services of both British superstars. Gallagher said: ""Yes Brothers and Sisters, I come bearing good news...Yours Truly is headlining Reading & Leeds 2021. C'MON YOU KNOW. LG"" Catfish And The Bottlemen, who will headline the festival for the first time, told BBC Radio 1 it was a ""huge honour"" to have been asked to top the bill. ""We've always had it in the back of our minds since we first played the BBC Introducing stage [in 2013],"" the band's frontman Van McCann said. ""To be able to come back now and have that slot, it's a big one. ""We'll probably turn up with a few new songs."" The organisers are hoping fans will still enjoy attending - although it may not look quite like this next year However, some on social media complained about the lack of female artists among next year's headliners, all of whom are male. Robert accused the organisers of ""misogyny"", while another tweeted that the headliners were being outshone by the women featured in the 2021 line-up, but apparently ""deemed not headline-worthy"".

Hundreds to isolate after poultry factory outbreak,"The Banham Poultry factory in Attleborough has been partially closed Hundreds of poultry workers and their households have been urged to self-isolate following a Covid-19 outbreak at a factory, officials say. Ninety-six staff at Banham Poultry in Norfolk have tested positive for Covid-19, a rise of 21 since Thursday. So far 477 of the workforce of about 800 people have had tests. But Norfolk public health director Dr Louise Smith said all staff must self-isolate for 14 days ""if they have not tested positive or not been tested"". What do we know about the Banham Poultry outbreak? ""Staff and their households, including children, must self-isolate for 14 days, if they have not tested positive or not been tested,"" she said. ""Staff must isolate for 10 days if they have had a positive test result, and their households, including children, need to isolate for 14 days. ""Anyone who has not been tested is urged to apply for a test and more mobile units are being brought in to support this. ""As the relevant regulatory agencies have confirmed the building has been deep cleaned, the company is bringing in a new group of 45 people to continue to staff the slaughterhouse. ""This will ensure that the euthanasing of birds can continue, in accordance with the usual regulations."" Banham Poultry has been in business in Attleborough since 1965 Dr Smith said there was no evidence of a spread of this outbreak to the wider community after previously announcing that ""precautionary"" coronavirus testing had been extended to all staff. Blaine van Rensburg, managing director of Banham Poultry said last week that the ""safety of our employees remains our number one priority"".

Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained,"This video can not be played Portland protests: Calls for federal troops to leave US city Tensions are mounting in the US city of Portland, where federal troops have been sent to end almost two months of anti-racism protests, some of them violent. The protests began after the death of George Floyd in police custody in May. There have been nightly rallies ever since, with clashes between protesters and police escalating in recent days. President Donald Trump says he is trying to restore order. The approach has been criticised by local officials as an election-year ploy to try and paint his opponents as weak on law and order. Like other US cities, Portland, Oregon saw a wave of peaceful protests overFloyd's death in Minneapolis, with thousands taking to the streets to demand police reform and racial equality. Recent protests, however, have been marred by violence, arson, damage to property, arrests and allegations of police brutality. Last week, federal officers started cracking down on crowds gathering in the city against the wishes of state and local officials, drawing widespread criticism and legal challenges. Oregon sues over 'unlawful detentions' at protests Federal agents 'abuse power' in Portland arrests Federal officers in unmarked vehicles appeared to forcefully seize protesters from the streets and detain them without justification. They have also fired tear gas and less-lethal munitions into crowds of demonstrators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has called the protesters a ""violent mob"" and ""anarchists"". But officials in the city have drawn a distinction between the peaceful majority and smaller groups of troublemakers. Facing an election in November, President Trump has pledged to bring the unrest under control, blaming Democrats for allowing protests to descend into violence. ""We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it. Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators,""Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday,external. The role of federal troops sent to Portland is the subject of intense speculation at the moment. Numerous widely-shared videos show troops in camouflaged combat-style uniform arresting protesters, transporting them away in apparently unmarked vehicles. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi said ""unidentified Stormtroopers"" were ""kidnapping protesters"". Another Democrat Ro Khanna described those involved as ""secret federal agents"". So, who exactly are they? They belong to a new federal force created last month in an executive order signed by President Trump which tasks them to protect historic monuments, memorials, statues, and federal facilities. The personnel are drawn from a range of teams including the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency and the US Marshals Service. The Federal Protection Service, part of the Homeland Security and charged with protecting government buildings, also has officers in Portland and has detained protesters. The US Marshals Service's Special Operations Group says it is ""deployed in high-risk and sensitive law enforcement situations, national emergencies, civil disorder and natural disasters."" When asked about the arrest of a protester captured on video, the CBP said the individual was suspected of destroying federal property. They said agents had identified themselves and were wearing CBP insignia but their names were not displayed ""due to recent doxing incidents against law enforcement personnel who serve and protect our country."" Some of those CBP agents in Portland photographed in camouflage are in the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, the agency's equivalent to a Swat team. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, said the ""dozens if not hundreds of federal troops"" were ""sharply escalating the situation"". ""Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism,"" he told CNN on Sunday,renewing his call for the troops to leave the city. Oregon Governor Kate Brown, also a Democrat, mirrored those comments, accusing President Trump of sending federal troops to the city for ""political theatre"". The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit against the federal agencies involvedlast week, accusing them of unlawfully detaining protesters. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum requested a restraining order to stop agents arresting people. Given this legal challenge, the American Civil Liberties Union said the situation in Portland amounted to a ""constitutional crisis"". Federal officers have been accused of seizing protesters and driving away with them in unmarked vans But some activists have criticised the violence in the city, blaming it on a small minority of trouble-causers. Civil rights advocate Ron Herndon told the Associated Press some were ""taking advantage of the demonstrations for their own reasons that have nothing to do with social justice"". The state of Oregon is awaiting the outcome of its lawsuit against the federal government. Is it legal to send in federal forces? Why US protests are so powerful this time Meanwhile, the White House is said to be considering other ways it can use federal law enforcement agencies to quell civil unrest nationwide. ""You'll see something rolled out this week as we start to go in and make sure that the communities, whether it's Chicago or Portland, or Milwaukee, or someplace across the heartland of the country, we need to make sure our communities are safe,"" White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday, without giving specifics.

"'Covidiots' criticised on Tui quarantine flightMask rules ignored by some on a flight that left nearly 200 facing self-isolation, passenger claims.Wales","Nearly 200 passengers on a flight back from the Greek island of Zante have been told to self-isolate A flight from Zante which left nearly 200 people facing two weeks' self-isolation was a ""debacle"" and a ""free-for-all"", passengers say. One traveller said the Tui flight was full of ""covidiots"" and ""inept crew who couldn't care less"". Another claimed there ""wasn't much"" policing of rules. Sixteen passengers on flight TOM6215 from the Greek island to Cardiff have now tested positive. Tui said safety was a priority and it was concerned by the claims. ""Our crew are trained to the highest standards,"" the airline said. ""A full investigation is now under way as these concerns weren't reported during the flight or before today."" The 193 passengers and crew who were on board the flight on 25 August are being asked to self-isolate for a fortnight. Health officials said seven people from three different parties are believed to have been potentially infectious on board the aircraft.

Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar told BBC Radio Wales people returning from Zante in particular are ""picking up the infection and are coming to our attention"". Greece and its islandsremain on the UK government's list of quarantine-exempt countries, meaning travellers do not need to self-isolate on their return. But the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated itstravel advice,externalfor Zante on 29 August to reflect local coronavirus restrictions put in place on the island. Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to self-isolate before they had even learned about the positive cases. ""This flight was a debacle. The chap next to me had his mask around his neck. Not only did the airline not pull him up on it, they gave him a free drink when he said he knew a member of the crew,"" Ms Whitfield said. ""Loads of people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others. ""As soon as the flight landed, a load of people took their masks off immediately. The flight was full of selfish 'covidiots' and an inept crew who couldn't care less."" Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to isolate for two weeks before learning about the positive cases Ms Whitfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on. ""But the vast majority of people weren't being spoken to, and there was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn't say anything to him [about the mask],"" she said. The couple have now sent off for a test as they are experiencing mild symptoms, she added. Victoria Webb is concerned she only found out about the outbreak from a media report Victoria Webb was also on the flight and said she only became aware of the outbreak when her mother sent her a link to the BBC News story as she travelled home to London from Cardiff. ""I was surprised and slightly at a loss as to what the best course of action was as I was mid-journey,"" she said. ""I spoke to the train manager who was concerned but professional and eventually, after some discussion with his head office, moved me to a carriage where I was alone for the remainder of the journey. ""We also swapped details so I could inform him when I had my test result back."" She has now quarantined in line with government advice, but said she has received no communication from health bodies, such as track and trace. ""The contact forms are there to be used and communication should be swift and thorough so we know process is being followed and can measure its effectiveness,"" she added Governmentguidance for airline passengers states it is mandatory,externalfor travellers in Wales, England and Scotland to wear face coverings on board aircraft, while they are recommended in Northern Ireland. Passengers should remain seated ""as much as possible"" and ""follow instructions and guidance from crew"", it adds. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) recommends mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew as one of several actions to reduce what it says is the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft. Additional measures proposed: Temperature screening of passengers, airport workers and travellers Boarding and alighting processes that reduce contact with other passengers or crew Limiting movement within the cabin during flight More frequent and deeper cabin cleaning Simplified catering procedures to lower crew movement and interaction with passengers Iata does not recommend restricting the use of the middle seat to create social distancing while onboard aircraft. Another passenger on the flight, Lee Evans, described chaotic scenes at Zante airport where he said staff members handled passengers' phones to check boarding passes. ""It was a free-for-all to get on the plane,"" he told the BBC. ""There were people switching seats."" Lee Evans said passengers were not keeping 2m apart at the gate before boarding the flight While the requirement to wear masks was reinforced on board, Mr Evans added: ""There wasn't much in terms of policing what customers were doing on the aeroplane."" He described an email telling him and his family to self-isolate - which came almost a week after the flight - as a ""shock"". ""Someone needs to be held to account,"" he said. Another passenger, who only wanted to be identified as Lewis, said he had flown 11 times in the last six weeks with various airlines and all other flights were fine except for the Tui one. ""The flight was poorly managed by Tui,"" he said. ""Tui did announce that it was a requirement that the masks where kept on. It was said about four times. ""We made cabin crew aware that people were constantly removing their mask. No cabin crew approached those people. I've not experienced that from any flight I have had elsewhere."" He said people responded to requests from staff to make it known if they thought they had symptoms - and those were moved to the front where the curtain was closed. ""There were used wipes in my seat pocket when I got on, so the plane wasn't as clean as they said,"" he added. ""We should have been told to isolate before we got off the plane. We only found out from the news that this had happened. ""Five days later, I can't tell you how many people I have had contact with."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Travel expert Simon Calder said he was concerned about the length of time taken to contact people. ""It's absolutely imperative that people follow the rules,"" he said. ""By way of mitigation, speaking for cabin crew in general rather than for Tui who say they've got an investigation in place, it's very tough to police a late evening flight from a party island like Ibiza - or in this case Zante. ""They have to have regard for their own safety. Add to that there are legal exemptions for mask-wearing and it all becomes quite complicated. ""But what really worries me is the timing of all this. It's six days since that flight landed. ""We're supposed to fill in passenger locator forms with all our details and one would assume that as soon as any case is identified Public Health Wales would be on the case with everybody rather than leaving the best part of a week."" Tui said in a statement on Monday: ""Passengers are informed prior to travel and via PA announcements on the flight that they have to wear masks throughout and are not allowed to move around the cabin. ""Masks can only be removed when consuming food and drink."" Dr Shankar, PHW's Covid-19 incident director, told BBC Breakfast that public health officials initially identified seven people who had tested positive and were potentially infectious on the flight. He said since they began alerting passengers, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 16, but it was unclear where they had contracted the virus. He said that any of the 187 passengers and six crew on board the three-and-a-half hour flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport on Tuesday that had symptoms ""should book a test without delay"". It comes as agroup of people from Plymouth tested positive for the virusafter returning from Zante last Monday. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? There were1,715 new coronavirus cases - and one death - reported in the UKon Sunday - the highest number of daily infections recorded since 4 June. Cardiff Airport, which is owned by the Welsh Government, said it was working closely with airlines to ""facilitate passenger travel throughout this challenging time for the industry"". Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? ""Tui is taking every necessary measure following today's report,"" said Spencer Birns, Cardiff Airport's interim chief executive. ""Cardiff Airport is closely following guidelines set out by Public Health Wales, FCO and UK government and has already taken a number of measures to ensure the safety and security of our team and customers, which is our number one priority.""

Hotel Rwanda film hero arrested on terror chargesPaul Rusesabagina's efforts to save people during the Rwanda genocide were depicted in a film.Africa,"Paul Rusesabagina has criticised Rwanda's President Paul Kagame A man who inspired a Hollywood film about the 1994 Rwandan genocide has been arrested for leading ""terrorist movements"", officials say. Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, became well known after Hotel Rwanda depicted his efforts to save hundreds of Tutsis at his hotel during the 1994 genocide. He later launched an opposition party, which had an armed wing based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the genocide. They were killed by Hutu extremists who were forced from power by President Paul Kagame and his Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories Rwanda genocide: 100 days of slaughter 'I am a mother - I killed some children's parents' Mr Rusesabagina, 66, has received several human rights awards for his life-saving efforts, including the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. He was paraded by the authorities at a press conference in the capital, Kigali, after he was arrested under an international warrant. He had been living in exile. The authorities did not say where he was arrested or give any further details about the accusations he faces. Don Cheadle (L) played Mr Rusesabagina (R) in the film Mr Rusesabagina's name featured recently in a terrorism case in Rwanda. The court heard allegations that the National Liberation Front (FLN) rebel group had received help from Zambia's President Edgar Lungu because of his close friendship with Mr Rusesabagina. Mr Lungu's spokesman denied the allegation in a BBC interview. In 2011, Mr Rusesabagina was accused of funding subversion in Rwanda, but no charges were brought. At the time, he denied any wrongdoing and said there was a smear campaign against him. President Kagame's critics accuse him of not tolerating any opposition. Several opposition leaders have been jailed and others fled into exile. He says he is trying to prevent a return of ethnic hatred. The 2004 film Hotel Rwanda told the story of how Mr Rusesabagina, a middle-class Hutu married to a Tutsi, used his influence - and bribes - to convince military officials to secure a safe escape for an estimated 1,200 people who sought shelter at the Mille Collines Hotel in Kigali. Don Cheadle played Mr Rusesabagina in the film. Rwandan genocide survivors' group Ibuka has in the past said that he exaggerated his own role in helping hotel refugees escape the 100-day slaughter. This video can not be played Between April and July 1994, an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days. 'My father, the rapist': Hidden victims of Rwanda's genocide The radio show which brought children back from the dead The genocide orphans still searching for their names In 2007, Mr Rusesabagina said a UN-backed war crimes court should put some members of the RPF on trial for their alleged role in the genocide.

Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics?,"Two incidents have turned Wisconsin into the latest epicentre of America's police protests. What can the footage from two different shootings tell us about US policing? The first saw Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old black father, shot several times by a white officer, leaving him paralysed in hospital. The second followed in the unrest sparked by Mr Blake's shooting, where white 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two protesters. We asked two law enforcement experts for their take on the viral footage: New York Law School criminal law ProfessorKirk Burkhalter, who served 20 years in the New York City Police Department, and Brennan Center national security fellowMichael German, who was an FBI agent for 16 years. First, let's break down the two videos. In a bystander-filmed clip of the police shooting, Mr Blake is seen walking around to the front of his vehicle. One of the two officers following him at this point has a weapon drawn. It is unclear what the police officers said before the shooting. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting? Blake opens the door and leans into the car. The officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. The other officer also draws his gun. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses scream. Just before the first video that was released begins, police reportedly wrestled and tased Mr Blake. Investigators said a knife was later uncovered from the floor on the driver's side of Mr Blake's car. Mr Rittenhouse has appeared in a number of different videos from Tuesday night's Kenosha protest. In one, he speaks to police, who offer him water. Later, he is seen in footage running from a group of people, one of whom appears to fire into the air. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? Mr Rittenhouse appears to shoot a man who tries to assail him. As he flees and is chased again, he falls to the ground and shoots again.  A man falls to the ground, and many shots can be heard. This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Following this incident, Mr Rittenhouse approaches police vehicles with his arms in the air, his weapon slung across his chest. A bystander calls out that the teenager ""just shot"" people, but the police vehicles pass by to attend to the injured protesters. With Jacob Blake... While there is no specific rule for every single scenario, both experts note that as far as we know, Mr Blake was not being arrested or wanted for any heinous crime (like mass murder). The whole encounter played out in around seven seconds. ""The effort to prevent him from getting into his car and driving away is what led to the violence,"" says Mr German. ""They had his licence plate number, if they needed to go arrest him later, he would be easy to find."" Prof Burkhalter adds that in the moments leading up to the shots, officers ""passed through several decision points where, arguably, they could have made more effective decisions"", like tackling him or tasing him again. ""When someone resists arrest and they attempt to walk away, which happens often...that in and of itself is not carte blanche to use deadly physical force, period."" The retired detective adds that if Mr Blake threatened deadly force, drawing weapons could be justified. But he says it's ""particularly disturbing"" that an officer grabbed his shirt with one hand and fired with the other. ""It didn't appear to be life threatening at that particular point and holding someone in place so you can shoot them, unless they are actually armed at that time, seems wildly problematic."" There's also a lack of situational awareness, Prof Burkhalter points out, calling it ""an absolute miracle"" that none of the seven shots ricocheted to strike the children in the car. ...and Kyle Rittenhouse? Prof Burkhalter begins: ""It is absolutely ridiculous that, confronted with this person, the police would not take action."" Rendering aid, he says, is of course the number one priority. ""However, there were a significant number of police officers on this street. I would guess that some of those officers could have rendered aid and others could have pursued this man."" And as Mr German notes: a rifle shot is loud. For officers to respond and see anyone walking towards them with a rifle is a ""serious violation of police safety protocol"". ""To let that person go behind the police line is astonishing,"" he says. There are clear differences for Prof Burkhalter. One man who may or may not have been reaching for a knife was ""corralled, [an officer] holding his shirt like he's some type of animal"" and shot multiple times, he says, while the other was walking down the street with an assault weapon. But while a lot of emphasis is placed on the actions of a single officer, Prof Burkhalter says ""there's often a lot of blame to go around"". In both incidents, he asks: ""Where is the supervisor who was responsible for these actions?"" Letting an armed individual walk behind the line of cars ""is astonishingly dangerous for the police officers themselves,"" Mr German points out. These two incidents highlight the ways ""police are trained to be afraid of certain situations and not others,"" he says. The first shooting took place in broad daylight on a residential street. The second, in the middle of the night in a chaotic civil unrest environment. ""The situations are just so opposite in how the police should have responded compared to how they did."" Mr German criticises the development of a ""warrior cop mentality"" in the last two decades - the idea ""that police officers in their daily work are at extreme threat from the communities they serve and...treat every incident as one that could end their lives"". He says research shows that fear of death creates a mind-set that ""demonises out-groups"". Acknowledging the existence of conscious biases and racism will be key to reforming US law enforcement, he says. And there's another problem Mr German - who did undercover work with far-right groups - has seen play out in recent years. This video can not be played Myron Grant started therapy after the events that have shaped 2020 started to take a toll on his mental health White supremacist groups and armed militias have been seen interacting with police at protests. ""It's astonishing that even at the leadership level, they don't recognise the danger they're putting their officers in by suggesting those far-right militants aren't the bigger threat,"" he says. US white supremacist propaganda 'rose in 2019' For Prof Burkhalter, it's time to throw out the book on policing altogether, and pen a new one for the 21st century. In lieu of six-month academies, he suggests officers have a more undergraduate-style training: two years where trainees learn from department personnel and civilian academics about history, psychology, immigration law, sociology, and participate in on-the-street training with guided reflections. Policing standards should also be set at the national level, and there should be a national registry. Pay increases could also help attract a wider range of prospective candidates, he adds. With this dream in mind, Prof Burkhalter thinks the movement todefund the police- that is, to cut police funding and redistribute money to social programmes - ""would only compound the problem"". ""Revising departments and the training, the education that I'm talking about - that requires funding."" âBlack people have been through a lot this yearâ Video, 00:03:18âBlack people have been through a lot this yearâ Four facts that help explain anger at US policing Timeline of US police killings that led to protests 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

French magazine condemned for showing black MP as a slave,"DaniÃ¨le Obono was elected to the National Assembly in 2017 A French right-wing magazine has been criticised across the political spectrum in France for depicting a black socialist MP, DaniÃ¨le Obono, as a slave. The article in Valeurs actuelles accused Africans of colluding in slavery, and had a sketch of Ms Obono with an iron collar around her neck. Prime Minister Jean Castex said it was a ""revolting publication"". The magazine apologised to Ms Obono but denied the article was racist. Ms Obono, born in Gabon, is a deputy in the National Assembly for left-wing party France Unbowed, led by Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. She represents a Paris constituency. She tweeted the image with the words ""the far right - odious, stupid and cruel"". ""This image is an insult to my ancestors, my family and my political movement,"" she said, adding she was ""more determined than ever to fight against #racism, for liberty, equality and fraternity"" - repeating the most famous slogan of the French Revolution. The French presidential office said President Emmanuel Macron called Ms Obono and ""expressed his clear condemnation of any form of racism"". Wallerand De Saint-Just, a senior figure in the far-right National Rally (RN), condemned the magazine's image of Ms Obono, saying it showed ""contempt for her"". France saw big protests in June and July condemning colonial-era slavery and racism in France today, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and fury at the US police killing of George Floyd. Colonial abuses haunt France's racism debate France backs away from police chokehold ban The stories behind the statues targeted in protests This video can not be played There were clashes in Paris as police threw tear gas at protesters who hit them with stones President Macron has vowed to combat racism but said France would not remove controversial statues of colonial-era figures. There have been campaigns against such statues in the UK and US. The magazine Valeurs actuelles - meaning ""current values"" - said it had placed Ms Obono back in the context of 18th Century slavery as part of a fictional feature series. ""Our text is not racist at all,"" it argued. ""It is convenient for our opponents to throw that accusation at us."" It went on to say that the illustrations ""reinforce the inherent cruelty of the subject itself"". ""We are clear-sighted enough to understand that the person most affected, Ms DaniÃ¨le Obono, could have felt personally hurt by this fiction. We regret that and apologise to her.""

We're pausing our live coverage for now - we hope you've enjoyed reading. The main coronavirus stories on Monday are: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the emergency authorisation of vaccines requires a âgreat deal of seriousness and reflectionâ. The UN body's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told reporters that every country had the right to approve drugs without full trial, but it was ânot something that you do lightlyâ. Thirty three vaccine candidates are currently up for clinical trials,according to the WHO,external, and a further 143 are in pre-clinical evaluation. Spain has reported more than 23,000 new coronavirus cases since Friday - suggesting the national infection rate has dropped slightly from a peak reached in the previous week. The country's cumulative total now stands at 462,858 - among some of the highest numbers in the world. Five deaths have also been reported since yesterday, bringing the national tally to 29,094. Health authorities said the latest figures could be modified in the future as Spain retroactively adjusts its daily data. Read more about why Spain is witnessing a second wave of the virus. We've also been reporting onan illegal event in Norway. Norwegian police have charged two people with breaking into an underground bunker in Oslo and using it to host a party on Saturday where several people suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. The so-called ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a police patrol met a group of confused young people. Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. Twenty seven people are being treated in hospital for inhaling carbon monoxide - six of them are in serious condition, and three are in intensive care. Police said the gas was being emitted from a generator which was being used to power the party's music systems. The bunker had only one entrance during the party, raising concerns that there could have been many fatalities. âJust think how 200 people would have  needed to evacuate through that in case of fire,â Lars Magne Hovtun of the Oslo fire brigade told NRK. âIt would have been an even bigger catastrophe, with dozens, if not hundreds dead.â Police had been tipped off about the party, which broke national measures aimed at stop the spread of coronavirus. But on Monday police said they'd lacked capacity to check on it. Arrests were also made for public order offences and driving under the influence of drugs Eight people have been fined up to Â£10,000, following an illegal rave in Wales which attracted 3,000 people. It follows new legislation introduced by the Welsh Governmentlast week to stop gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Theunlicensed event at Banwen, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, started on Saturday night - but there were still 400 people at the site on Monday morning. Police described organisers as ""really irresponsible"". Niamh, a student from Cardiff who attended, admitted she was surprised by the scale of the event - likening it to a festival. But she said the words ""illegal rave"" conjured images of ""a bunch of crazy people breaking the rules"", when, in reality, ""it was a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone was being as safe as they possibly could"".

New rules came into force on Monday, obliging all high school pupils to wear face coverings when moving about within Scotland's secondary schools. The rules will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils and primary pupils aged over five. But Mr Swinney rejected the idea that pupils should be sent home if they fail to wear a face mask. He said pupils should be ""encouraged and motivated and required"" to wear a face covering, which should be viewed as ""a habitual part of school life"". ""But it should not result in exclusion from school if they don't,"" he stressed. Exclusion had been mooted by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) at the government's coronavirus briefing on Monday. Mr Swinney said face coverings were worn ""to protect all of the school population - staff and pupils alike"". Several Swedish drug stores have reported a spike in demand for face masks, Reuters news agency reports, as authorities consider a change in policy on face coverings. Unlike most other countries in Europe, Sweden hasn't recommended the use of masks, and has kept many businesses and schools open. But Swedes have reportedly been stockpiling for the last two weeks, after the country's public health agency said it may issue new recommendations. Online pharmacist Apotea said that, during the last few weeks, online sales of face masks have nearly tripled to around 400,000 a week, according to Reuters. Drug store Apoteket has also seen a 30% rise in recent weeks. Par Svardson, Apotea's chief executive, told Reuters he expects a five to 10-fold increase in face mask sales, should government recommendations change. Sweden's death toll relative to its population has been high compared with some European neighbours. But the figure is still lower than other countries like the UK and Spain which have adopted strict lockdowns. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Parliament returns on Tuesday Conservative MPs in the UK are expecting a fractious atmosphere when they return to parliament on Tuesday, following the summer recess. When coronavirus hit, many of the government's plans went out the window. Ministers were forced to react quickly to unprecedented challenges. But the government has changed its mind a lot - and very publicly - in the last few months. To name a few: the NHS health surcharge, the NHS bereavement scheme, the rollout of the ""critical"" track and trace app, getting all primary pupils back in school before the summer, free school meals during the summer, the results algorithm, face coverings in schools. And there have been big changes in policy when it came to quarantine on arrival in the UK, which frustrated MPs too. There is growing disquiet in the Conservative Party that the government is on the back foot and that policies keep ""evolving"". U-turns are not always viewed as a bad thing - demonstrating, as they sometimes do, a government that is willing to listen. The danger for the government is that the public loses faith that ministers are in control - and loses faith in their decisions. With a new poll indicating that Labour has drawn level with the Tories, it suggests Boris Johnsonmay have his work cut out for him. Read more from Nick. A survey by Dalhousie University in Canada has found that support for stronger regulations on the use of plastic packaging has fallen during the coronavirus pandemic. Comparing survey results from a similar study conducted last year, researchers found support for a ban on plastics is down 12 percentage points to 58%, while the number of people wanting stronger regulations has fallen 11 percentage points to 79%. Support has also diverged among men and women - with support for bans and regulations dropping sharply among men. Over half of respondents also agreed that new laws on plastics should be delayed until after the pandemic is over. The study's authors say concerns about food safety are a major factor behind the change in tone. âCovid-19 may have made some people forget about our plastic addiction, but the problem is still amongst us.â, said Dr. Tony Walker, a co-author of the study. The conclusions are based on a survey 977 Canadians interviewed in July this year, and compared with answers from 1014 Canadians gathered in May 2019. The latest government figures,externalshow that there have been 1,406 positive cases of coronavirus reported in the UK over the past 24 hours - a drop of nearly 300 cases on the previous day's figures. Sunday saw the number of daily recorded cases reach 1,715 - the highest since early June. There were a further two deaths with coronavirus recorded on Monday. Sunday saw just one death recorded in the previous 24 hours. Figures for Mondays tend to be lower however, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Experts have suggested the rising case numbers, which have been climbing in the UK since July, may be the result of an increase in testing over recent weeks - meaning more people with the virus are being detected. The mayor of Philadelphia has been criticised for dining at an indoor restaurant in the neighbouring state of Maryland - despite introducing an indoor dining ban in his own city. A picture of Mayor Jim Kenney has gone viral, sparking accusations of hypocrisy by Philadelphia restauranteurs like Marc Vetri. Vetri has been railing against the closure of indoor dining.

In a statement, Mayor Kenney's office defended his decision, saying he had been ""[patronising] a restaurant owned by a friend of his"". ""Of course we understand the frustrations of local restaurant owners who have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic,"" it added. ""But there are 782 total cases in the county the mayor briefly visited, compared to over 33,000 cases in Philadelphia. Drastically different circumstances.â This video can not be played Coronavirus in Scotland: No 'one-size-fits-all approach' for local lockdowns The steps taken to try to suppress future local coronavirus outbreaks in Scotland will not necessarily follow the approach taken in Aberdeen, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Pubs and restaurants were shut for a period in the city during August after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to nightlife. According to Scotland's first minister, the management of future clusters would depend on the cause and potential spread. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed concern after 160 people tested positive for coronavirus in the past 24 hours - the biggest daily rise since mid-May. A total of 69 of the new cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with Sturgeon saying ""particularly close attention"" was being paid to this. Another 27 cases were reported in Lanarkshire, 18 in Lothian, and eight in Ayrshire and Arran. However, there were just four new cases in the Grampian area, suggesting the surge in Aberdeen - which led to a local lockdown - has been contained. The number of new daily cases in Scotland has slowed drastically since the peak of the outbreak in April, but local clusters have been occurring since the end of July. This chart below shows a breakdown by NHS health board of the last seven days of cases per 100,000 people. You can find out morehere.

activists who overpowered police at the entrance to parliament â the Reichstag â
in Berlin on Saturday. The activists, some waving old imperial flags as symbols of
the far right, were part of a bigger demonstration against coronavirus
restrictions in Germany. Police reinforcementsdispersed the crowd on the steps ofthe Reichstag, using pepper spray, before they could storm the building. Several politicians called the incident âshamefulâ, among them
Chancellor Angela Merkelâs spokesman Steffen Seibert. Centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Lars Klingbeil called
the protestersâ action âan attack on our democracyâ. The Berlin police chief in charge on Saturday, Stephan

and there were only three police at the top, he said.

Pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms, but where adults cannot keep a two-metre distance and are interacting face-to-face for more than 15 minutes, face coverings should be worn.

RAF jets were scrambled to intercept the Ryanair plane and escorted it to Stansted at about 19:00 BST on Sunday. Counter-terror officers detained two men, but after investigating they discovered the object in the toilet was a mobile phone. The men are not considered to have committed any offences, police said. A Ryanair spokesman said the crew of the flight from Vienna to Stansted had been alerted to a ""potential security threat on board"". Typhoon jets from RAF Coningsby intercepted the plane and escorted it to the Essex airport. The Eastern Region Special Operations Unit said the men were detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act.

"Last day for an Eat Out to Help Out discountBusinesses want the scheme to be extended, saying October and November are the ""biggest worry"".Business","This video can not be played ""I think it is going to be a tough winter"" The government's Eat Out to Help Out discount ends on Monday, having been praised by many of the restaurants, cafes and pubs it was designed to help. Businesses say the scheme - which gives diners 50% off, up to Â£10 - has successfully tempted more people to eat out again after lockdown was eased. Many want the scheme extended, with one restaurant owner saying the ""biggest worry"" will be in October and November. Research suggests trade on some days in August was twice last year's levels. The discount scheme - which finishes today - has applied to sit-in meals and soft drinks, Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limit to the number of times it could be used. 'I saved Â£200 doing Eat Out to Help Out every day' Restaurants extend discount dining into September Some 84,000 outlets signed up, with claims made for more than 64 million meals, according to the most recently released Treasury statistics. OpenTable data indicates there were 106% more seated diners last Tuesday than the same day in 2019. But there are now calls for the scheme to be extended or return later in the year, amid fears the benefits will be short lived. The boss of pub chain Greene King told the BBC that, while some of its 3,100 locations had seen a huge boost to sales, city centre sites were still struggling, particularly in London. Andy Lennox runs the two Zim Braai restaurants in Bournemouth, which specialise in African food. He also founded The Wonky Table, a network of around 500 hospitality firms in the area. His business survived the lockdown by using the government's emergency support schemes, including bounceback loans. Eat Out to Help Out has helped him recoup some of his losses. ""Trade's record-breaking at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""It is a false bubble so we're not getting too excited, but Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are up probably 100% [on last year]. The week's up 50%. Thursday has pivoted - it's the new Monday."" Mr Lennox credits high numbers of tourists in Bournemouth this summer for some of the rise. He does not mind trade being drawn away from the weekend, saying reduced capacity due to social distancing means he could not cope with bumper Saturdays. The Sinyinza family Customers at the nearby Olive CafÃ© last Wednesday told us they had taken advantage of the cheaper meals multiple times ""This week we've done breakfast, dinner, breakfast, dinner,"" said Jasmine Sinyinza, visiting the town with her family. ""We probably would not have gone out as much without it"". ""We had to book the restaurants before we left home to get the availability, because it's so popular,"" added her mum, Michelle Sinyinza. A waiter at the Spyglass and Kettle wearing personal protective equipment Joanne Botta, general manager of the Spyglass and Kettle - a Greene King pub - in nearby Southbourne, said some regulars were still wary about venturing out. Nonetheless, there had been surge in evening bookings. ""The challenge has been getting the ordering right and getting the team levels right, but it feels good to have our pubs packed."" Research by food and drink consultancy CGA suggested that across the whole of the scheme's third week, food sales were 15% higher than in the equivalent period in 2019. It found sales were also growing between Thursday and Sunday, although sales on those four days remained well below last year. However there is evidence that while places with high levels of visitors and tourists like Bournemouth saw a significant boost, other locations continued to struggle. Diners at the Spyglass and Kettle pub Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of Greene King, told the BBC that some of his sites continued to see low footfall. ""While a lot of our businesses were 50%, 70%, 90% up year-on-year, central London was about 30% down. It is pretty stark. ""I've called for the government to think about maybe doing a similar scheme for city centres and for London. We need to get people back into cities particularly into central London."" Some restaurants have committed tocarrying on some form of discount for longer. One of them is Comptoir CafÃ© and Wine in central London, which will continue offering a 50% discount on Mondays to Wednesdays in September, thanks to its landlord Grosvenor subsidising the deal. Manager Sabrina Barreiros said her business still needs a boost after a dire July: ""It will help us a lot with trade, and we'll have people who are back to work in the offices as well."" Sabrina Barreiros at the Comptoir cafe in central London Mr Lennox in Bournemouth will continue to offer 25% off up to Â£5 in September. However he said there was anxiety among hospitality firms about the autumn, calling for the Eat Out to Help Out subsidy to be revived later in the year. ""Give September that breathing space, let the schools open. Then bring it back in October and November where predominantly it's going to be the quietest part of the year. That's where the biggest worry is."" He said venues in his area faced a dilemma over hiring extra staff to cope with the huge demand in August, when it was unclear whether they'd have enough hours for those teams in the quiet months. On Monday chancellor Rishi Sunak thanked diners for helping to protect 1.8 million jobs in the hospitality sector. ""The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery,"" he said. The government doesn't plan to extend the scheme, but a Treasury spokesperson said other support for hospitality goes beyond August. They highlighted the furlough scheme - which comes to an end in October - and the temporary VAT cut to 5%.

Former president of India dies after Covid diagnosisPranab Mukherjee had a long political career and also served on the boards of IMF and World Bank.India,"Pranab Mukherjee rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts as president India's former president Pranab Mukherjee has died 21 days after it was confirmed that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The 84-year-old was in hospital to remove a clot in his brain when it was discovered he also had Covid-19. Before serving as president between 2012 and 2017, Mr Mukherjee held several important portfolios during his 51-year political career. These included the finance, foreign and defence ministries.

The job of president is largely ceremonial but becomes crucial when elections throw up fragmented mandates. The president decides which party or coalition can be invited to form a government. Mr Mukherjee didn't have to take such a decision because the mandate was clear during his presidency. But he showed his assertiveness in other decisions, such as rejecting the mercy petitions of several people who had been sentenced to death. Mr Mukherjee also served on the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Most of his career was with the Congress party which dominated Indian politics for decades before suffering two consecutive losses in 2014 and 2019 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Mukherjee joined the party in the 1960s during the tenure of then prime minister Indira Gandhi whom he had described as his mentor. In 1986 he fell out with the Congress leadership and started his own political party, but returned two years later. He regarded former PM Indira Gandhi as his mentor A parliamentarian for 37 years, Mr Mukherjee was widely known as a consensus-builder. Given that consecutive governments before 2014 were built on coalitions, this was an important and valued attribute. However, Mr Mukherjee's larger ambition - of becoming India's prime minister - was never realised. He was overlooked for the post twice - after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 and after his party's unexpected election win in 2004. Manmohan Singh, a trained economist who was chosen as the prime minister, later said that Mr Mukherjee had every reason to feel aggrieved. ""He was better qualified than I was to become the prime minister, but he also knew that I have no choice in the matter,"" Dr Singh said. Pranab Mukherjee was one of India's most astute politicians. As one of the leading figures of the Congress party, he held every key ministry in India - commerce, defence, external affairs and finance - over a chequered half- a-century-long political career. What the diminutive leader lacked as a politician with a mass base - he was mostly elected to the upper house of the parliament - he made up with his keen sense of realpolitik and formidable managerial skills. During the two-term Congress-led government which ended in 2014, Mr Mukherjee deftly negotiated the choppy waters of an unwieldy and often fractious coalition. He worked tirelessly at building consensus on a raft of rights-based legislations relating to matters like food security and right to information that helped his party gain political heft and popularity. His record as a finance minister in the second term was less stellar: the economy overheated, inflation peaked and interest rates went through the roof. Critics called him one of the ""worst"" finance ministers India ever had. As the 13th president of the republic, Mr Mukherjee walked a fine line, having good relations with his party's arch foe and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his own Congress party leaders. In many ways, he was a remarkable exception in the rough and tumble of Indian politics: a calm bipartisan leader and a dour consensus builder with an encyclopaedic memory. When Mr Mukherjee was appointed India's president in 2012, he was widely acknowledged as being the most experienced politician by far to take up the post. His tenure as president saw him reject up to 18 bills that were sent to him for assent. Presidents generally do not reject bills sent to them. He also rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts - the highest by far of any Indian president. As a result, Afzal Guru - convicted of involvement in the 2001 attack on India's parliament was hanged in February 2013. Yakub Memon, who was convicted of financing the 1993 terror attacks in Mumbai, and Ajmal Kasab, one of the gunmen in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, were also hanged during his tenure.

"Carbon monoxide poisons secret bunker partygoersA ""Rave Cave"" party in the Norwegian capital Oslo leaves 25 people in need of hospital treatment.Europe","Around 200 people are thought to have attended the rave Twenty-five people have been taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning after attending an illegal rave in a bunker in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. Five are in a critical condition and two police officers who tended to the partygoers are among those poisoned. Authorities believe the poisoning was caused by portable generators. Police say the ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a patrol met a group of confused young people. Country profile Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. It was not immediately known who had organised the underground event which was reportedly planned three weeks in advance and kept secret from the authorities. Oslo police say they are investigating why a tip-off about the rave was not acted upon. Emergency services found seven people unconscious in the bunker in the city's St Hanshaugen area. The lives of all of the victims, believed to be mainly aged between 20 and 30, are said to be out of danger but police have called for other attendees to seek medical attention if they start suffering from nausea, headaches or dizziness. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gasproduced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. The gas is harmful because it displaces oxygen from red blood cells, resulting in damage to major organs. One man who left before police arrived told public broadcaster NRK he had gone outside repeatedly for fresh air after arriving for the rave at 23:00 (21:00 GMT) on Saturday.

Delay next year's GCSE and A-level exams - Labour,"Next year's A-level and GCSE exams in England should be pushed back to mid-summer to help cope with the impact of coronavirus, Labour has said. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said students starting Year 11 and 13 in September had ""a mountain to climb"", having missed months of schooling. Exams scheduled for May should happen as late as July to allow more catch-up teaching time, she added. The government said it would ""consider"" its approach but exams would go ahead. Williamson urges parents to send pupils to school Heads reassure pupils: 'We are ready for you' Exams chaos 'must never happen again' Chaos dogged the exams system this year, leaving teachers, parents and pupils callingfor a major re-think of next summer's exams. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded to studentswere below teachers' predictions,with disadvantaged students particularly badly affected. Days after results were announced, and following widespread criticism, the government performed a U-turn and decided tobase grades on teachers' estimatesinstead. But many pupils were left in limbo, having already missed out on university places for this year's intake. GCSEs and A-level exams are expected to take place as normal next year, but Ms Green said: ""It's so important that the government starts to make contingency plans now so we don't see a repeat of the fiasco that we saw over the last few weeks."" She said students heading into year 11 and year 13 - the GCSE and A-level exam years - had seen ""a lot of disruption to their education"" and ""our first priority must be to give the students every possible chance to demonstrate their learning, their attainment and their potential"". ""Young people have never been front of mind when the government has been managing its way, or failing to manage its way, through this Covid crisis,"" Ms Green told BBC Breakfast. It would be ""unthinkable"" for exams to stay the same, said year 11 student Hemlata Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said Labour's plan was ""worthy of serious consideration"". But he added: ""A delay is not without its problems. A consequential delay to the publication of results will put pressure on higher education providers such as universities and colleges, as well as employers."" Year 11 student Hemlata told the BBC that ""the 2021 exams staying the same is unthinkable"". But Amber, who is in year 13, said that the delay could be a ""false hope"" unless there were clear plans to provide results and confirm university admissions in time. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of the university admissions body Ucas, said a delay to exams would create ""massive ripples of impact"" on entrance to university, sixth form or progression to apprenticeships. She said markers already had to read five million GCSE scripts and two million A-level papers on a tight schedule, making it hard to shorten the marking period. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons Education Select Committee, said there was only a ""50:50"" chance of A-level and GCSE exams taking place at all next summer, despite the government's promise. He toldthe Sunday Times,externalthat exams regulator Ofqual should set an October deadline for deciding whether to cancel them and instead base grades once again on teacher assessments. CHILDREN'S RISK:Study shows it is 'tiny' GETTING ABOUT:Is it safe to use public transport? BACK TO SCHOOL:Does my child have to return? Calls for a delay to exams come as millions of children are due to return to the classroom in England and Wales this week. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland have already reopened. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Getting all children back into their classrooms full-time in September is a national priority, as they are the best place for their education, development and wellbeing. ""We recognise that students due to take exams next summer will have experienced disruption to their education, which is why we prioritised bringing Year 10 and Year 12 pupils back to school last term. ""Exams will go ahead next year, and we have been working closely with the sector, Ofqual and exam boards to consider our approach."" Head teachers have saidthey are ready to welcome pupils back to school full-time, with a range of measures being put in place, such as staggered breaks and increased cleaning. But school leaders have warned that their budgets have been stretched by the pandemic to such an extent that they are having to weigh up pupil safety against their finances,the Guardian reports,external. Additional cleaning, personal protective equipment, the installation of hand washing stations and signs, plus the purchasing of laptops for remote working are among the Covid-related expenses incurred by schools, head teachers and unions told the paper. Meanwhile, a poll of nearly 6,000 school staff in England has found that 86% believe maintaining a social distance from both pupils and staff will not be possible. The survey by Tes found that 66% feared guidance to avoid busy corridors, entrances and exits was unrealistic.

Carbon monoxide poisons secret bunker partygoers,"Around 200 people are thought to have attended the rave Twenty-five people have been taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning after attending an illegal rave in a bunker in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. Five are in a critical condition and two police officers who tended to the partygoers are among those poisoned. Authorities believe the poisoning was caused by portable generators. Police say the ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a patrol met a group of confused young people. Country profile Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. It was not immediately known who had organised the underground event which was reportedly planned three weeks in advance and kept secret from the authorities. Oslo police say they are investigating why a tip-off about the rave was not acted upon. Emergency services found seven people unconscious in the bunker in the city's St Hanshaugen area. The lives of all of the victims, believed to be mainly aged between 20 and 30, are said to be out of danger but police have called for other attendees to seek medical attention if they start suffering from nausea, headaches or dizziness. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gasproduced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. The gas is harmful because it displaces oxygen from red blood cells, resulting in damage to major organs. One man who left before police arrived told public broadcaster NRK he had gone outside repeatedly for fresh air after arriving for the rave at 23:00 (21:00 GMT) on Saturday. ""When you rave in a room without windows with 50 to 60 others, the air becomes heavy,"" the unnamed man said. ""I had to go out several times and breathe fresh air.""

Price of plastic carrier bags in England to doubleThe fee for single-use bags will rise to 10p and be extended to all shops from April 2021.UK,"The fee for plastic shopping bags in England will be doubled to 10p and extended to all shops from April 2021. Small retailers - those employing 250 people or fewer - will no longer be exempt, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. Environment Secretary George Eustice described the UK as ""a world-leader in this global effort"". Greenpeace said the move was ""a small step in the right direction"" but urged the government to go further. The environmental group called for ""fast and substantial reductions on plastic pollution"" beyond the issue of carrier bags. Mr Eustice described the original 5p charge at large retailers as a ""tremendous success"" and said the increase to 10p should be seen alongside other measures such as the ban on plastic straws, drinks stirrers and cotton buds in England. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had somewhere between six and 10 bags for life at his home but did sometimes purchase carriers when he forgot them. The increase in charge for single-use bags will encourage the sale and use of bags for life, he added. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags. It was introduced first in Wales in 2011, then in Northern Ireland in 2013, before Scotland introduced the charge for all carrier bags in 2014, and England rolled out its plastic bag charge on 5 October 2015. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic A public consultation in England last year saw the ""vast majority"" of people back government plans to raise the fee, in a bid to further reduce the plastic used by consumers. Since the fee was introduced in England, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation, with studies demonstrating the levy has had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea. In 2014, 7.6 billion bags were given away to customers at England's seven largest supermarkets, the equivalent of 140 per member of the population. Between 2017 and 2018 just over a billion bags were sold at major supermarkets across the UK. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Smaller retailers in England supply about 3.6 billion single-use bags annually. Last December, the Association of Convenience Stores estimated about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags. The government ""expects"" retailers to donate proceeds from plastic bag sales to good causes - but it's not compulsory. According to Defra, an estimated Â£51m was donated in 2017-18. But while the vast majority of retailers chose to donate their plastic bag revenue - in line with government expectations - some chose to keep the money instead. Greenpeace welcomed the fee increase, but said plastic carriers bags were only ""one part of the problem"" and the government should be considering taking action on plastic bags-for-life. Greenpeace's Sam Chetan-Welsh said: ""By raising the price of plastic bags again the government is taking a small step in the right direction, but by now they should be taking great strides."" He added there were ""so many ways ministers know they could be driving fast and substantial reductions on plastic pollution"". ""If they're increasing costs for shoppers, ministers really have no excuse not to increase costs for the companies that are responsible for the escalating volumes of single-use plastic packaging in the first place."" Earlier this month, supermarketMorrisons initiated a trial offering paper bags instead of reusable plastic ones, with the aim of ditching all plastic bags from its stores. Responding to the forthcoming fee hike, CPRE - the countryside charity - said it was time to ""step up and face the war on plastic"". ""Government should bring in charges on all single-use, throwaway items - from takeaway cups to wooden forks,"" said Tom Fyans, deputy chief executive. ""Incentivising re-use systems and finally committing to an all-in Deposit Return Scheme for drinks containers are the only ways the government can achieve a litter-free countryside and win the war on waste.""

"Trump and Biden trade blame over Portland unrestA man was shot dead in the city on Saturday, which has seen weeks of demonstrations.US & Canada","This video can not be played The scene following the shooting of Aaron Danielson in Portland on 29 August President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden have been accusing one another over violence that has erupted at protests in Portland, Oregon. A man linked to a right-wing group was killed on Saturday, as elsewhere in the city a pro-Trump rally clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Trump called participants of the rally ""great patriots"" and blamed the city's Democratic mayor for the unrest. Mr Biden in turn accused Mr Trump of ""rooting for chaos and violence"". In a campaign speech in the city of Pittsburgh on Monday, the Democratic candidate said: ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames. But we must not burn. We have to build."" Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? Portland has become a flashpoint for demonstrations against police brutality and racism since the police killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May triggered a wave of national and international outrage. Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over Saturday's deadly shooting, while the founder of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer identified the victim as a supporter. Mr Trump on Sunday re-tweeted what appeared to be the dead man's name along with the message ""Rest in Peace"". Police have not publicly named the suspect or the victim, or specified whether the shooting was directly linked to the clashes. The president is set to visit the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday amid anger there over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake. Mr Trump has blamed Portland's Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler for the unrest. ""Portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor,"" he wrote on Twitter on Sunday as he suggested sending federal forces to the city. He also accused Mr Biden of being ""unwilling to lead"".

Mr Trump continued on Monday, describing Portland as ""a mess"" and repeating calls for ""LAW & ORDER."" ""If this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up, we will go in and do it for them,"" he wrote. In another tweet he said ""Radical Left Mayors & Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their 'Movement'."" ""It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists & Agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement,"" he added in reference to his Democratic rival. On Sunday Mr Biden said the president ""may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong - but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is"". Mr Biden travelled to Pittsburgh for a campaign speech on Monday He continued the argument in his speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, where he said Mr Trump had ""fomented"" violence in US cities. He called Mr Trump ""a bystander in his own presidency"" and ""an incumbent president who makes things worse not better"".

Poisoning the values this nation has always held dear. Poisoning our very democracy. ""Will we rid ourselves of this toxin or make it a permanent part of this nation's character?"" Mayor Wheeler has also hit back at Mr Trump's criticism, saying the US president had ""created the hate and the division"". ""I'd appreciate it if the president would support us or stay the hell out of the way,"" he added. Law and order is a major theme of President Trump's bid for re-election, as he seeks to paint the Democrats and their candidate as soft on crime.

"Men held over plane 'security threat' releasedCounter-terror officers say an object found in the plane's toilet ""was found not to be of concern"".","Typhoon fighter jets intercepted the plane and escorted it to Stansted on Sunday Two men arrested after reports of a ""suspicious device"" in a passenger plane's toilet have been released without charge. RAF jets were scrambled to intercept the Ryanair plane and escorted it to Stansted at about 19:00 BST on Sunday. Counter-terror officers detained two men, but after investigating they discovered the object in the toilet was a mobile phone. The men are not considered to have committed any offences, police said. A Ryanair spokesman said the crew of the flight from Vienna to Stansted had been alerted to a ""potential security threat on board"". Typhoon jets from RAF Coningsby intercepted the plane and escorted it to the Essex airport. The Eastern Region Special Operations Unit said the men were detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. But in a new statement on Monday the unit said: ""After examination by specialist investigators, the object was found not to be of concern. ""Officers spoke with the two men and neither were considered to have committed any offences."" Det Supt Andy Waldie added: ""We understandably take any reports of suspicious objects or behaviour on flights very seriously and thankfully on this occasion there was no cause for concern.

Scottish gyms and swimming pools reopen,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish gyms and pools reopen Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts can now reopen in Scotland after the coronavirus lockdown. After almost 24 weeks, venues are able to open afterNicola Sturgeon brought the planned date for some indoor sports forwardby two weeks. It comes as the requirement for school pupils to wear face coverings also comes into effect. Secondary pupils will wear them between classes and all pupils will wear them on school transport. The reopening of indoor sports halls followsweeks of pressure from the fitness industryand sports governing bodies. They argued that strict safety measures would allow them to open safely. Why have Scotland's pubs opened before its gyms? Fear of 'long term damage' to Scottish gymnastics Rink closures threat to ice hockey club's future Over 12s can take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios. Younger children can do all activity. The gym and swimming pool at Inverness Leisure Centre opened at midnight. People were back in the gym in Inverness as soon as it opened Lee Crawford was one of the first in when the doors opened. ""I had nothing on tomorrow so thought I'd get a couple of hours tonight,"" he said. ""I haven't lifted heavy weights in a wee while, just been stuck in the garage with light weights. ""I thought it would be busier than this."" Social distancing measures have been put in place at the Inverness gym Swim coach Kirsty Ewan, who was back in the pool just after midnight, said: ""I was just a bit excited. I think it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. ""I spend a large proportion of my life here, coaching and swimming myself, so to be away for so long I just wanted to come back at the first opportunity. ""I've definitely missed being in the pool. I've done some open-water swimming in lochs but there's nothing quite like being in the pool with the smell of chlorine and things, so it's really nice to be back."" Gym owner Steven Morley opened the doors of his New Age Fitness gyms in Hamilton and Coatbridge at 06:00. He told the BBC his staff had been working non-stop to get safety measures in place. Steven said: ""It's been tough but we knew this was just temporary. To watch the members walk back through the doors will be absolutely amazing and will make all the hard work myself and the staff have put in the last few weeks worth it."" Gymnastics clubs were also waiting to welcome back their athletes. West Lothian Gym Club made videos to show its members its anti-virus measures West Lothian Gymnastics Club in Livingston was previously the only club in Scotland allowed to open as it welcomed just five high performance gymnasts but it was preparing to welcome its younger gymnasts on Monday. The club has shared videos showing the children how one-way systems and ""gym bubbles"" will work. Head women's coach Becki Campbell said: ""We have managed to prepare well in advance so we are ready. On Monday we welcome two recreational classes and five competitive groups. ""We have also been doing gymnast workshops on Zoom. We were worried some would not feel ready but they absolutely are."" The Gold Star cheerleaders know training will be very different now with restrictions in place Even dance schools have had to mark out the floor to keep children socially distanced Dance schools also have the go-ahead to open. Scotland's most successful cheerleading squad, Gold Star in Glasgow said it had made sure its studio was as safe as it could be. Owner Claire McCreath said: ""We have spent the whole week deep cleaning, then doing it again and again. We are relieved, excited and ready to roll and it will be the best feeling to see and hear the people in real life."" Many of Scotland's public and charitable trust-run pools and gyms are taking a slower approach. One issue is the viability of reopening if customer numbers are low and operational costs high. While High Life Highland, which operates sport and leisure facilities in the area, says all of its leisure facilities will reopen today, others have said some facilities will not reopen until October. Different arrangements are in place for each area. For example, although most of the facilities run by Live Argyll are reopening today, pre-booking will be required and limited to members only for the first four weeks. Pools will be open for lane swimming only and there will be a minimum age of eight. In the Borders, the trust that runs leisure facilities on behalf of the council has started a phased reopening of its facilities. Live Life Aberdeenshire is taking the same approach. But in Dumfries and Galloway, the council is working towards having its sites across the region - including the flagship DG1 centre - open by 14 September. In Angus, the seven Angus Live sport and leisure venues will not reopen until after 14 September. The operators say it is to allow for safety procedures to be put in place and for staff to be trained. No dates have been given for when pools in the area will reopen. Similarly in South Lanarkshire, fitness classes will not resume until 14 September and gyms will reopen the following week. Pools will not open until Monday 5 October. North Ayrshire Swimming Club will resume training in the water in two weeks. Swimmer Isla Waller has been training by Zoom for five months and only recently started land training and braving outdoor swimming. After missing her national championships she is ready to get back and more than willing to wait a little longer. Isla, like a lot of swimmers and athletes who train in local authority facilities, will have to wait a bit longer to get back The 13-year-old told the BBC: ""I was so excited when we heard the date. My mum texted me at school to tell me. ""It will be different when we get back to the pool but we will be fine. ""It will be good to see friends because we don't get to see everyone at land training."" More restrictions will be lifted on 14 September. Sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues will be able to reopen with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions.

Trump and Biden trade blame over Portland unrest,"This video can not be played The scene following the shooting of Aaron Danielson in Portland on 29 August President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden have been accusing one another over violence that has erupted at protests in Portland, Oregon. A man linked to a right-wing group was killed on Saturday, as elsewhere in the city a pro-Trump rally clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Trump called participants of the rally ""great patriots"" and blamed the city's Democratic mayor for the unrest. Mr Biden in turn accused Mr Trump of ""rooting for chaos and violence"". In a campaign speech in the city of Pittsburgh on Monday, the Democratic candidate said: ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames. But we must not burn. We have to build."" Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? Portland has become a flashpoint for demonstrations against police brutality and racism since the police killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May triggered a wave of national and international outrage. Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over Saturday's deadly shooting, while the founder of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer identified the victim as a supporter. Mr Trump on Sunday re-tweeted what appeared to be the dead man's name along with the message ""Rest in Peace"". Police have not publicly named the suspect or the victim, or specified whether the shooting was directly linked to the clashes. The president is set to visit the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday amid anger there over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake. Mr Trump has blamed Portland's Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler for the unrest. ""Portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor,"" he wrote on Twitter on Sunday as he suggested sending federal forces to the city. He also accused Mr Biden of being ""unwilling to lead"".

Mr Trump continued on Monday, describing Portland as ""a mess"" and repeating calls for ""LAW & ORDER."" ""If this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up, we will go in and do it for them,"" he wrote. In another tweet he said ""Radical Left Mayors & Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their 'Movement'."" ""It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists & Agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement,"" he added in reference to his Democratic rival. On Sunday Mr Biden said the president ""may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong - but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is"". Mr Biden travelled to Pittsburgh for a campaign speech on Monday He continued the argument in his speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, where he said Mr Trump had ""fomented"" violence in US cities. He called Mr Trump ""a bystander in his own presidency"" and ""an incumbent president who makes things worse not better"". ""Donald Trump has been a toxic presence on our nation for four years,"" Mr Biden said. ""Poisoning how we talk to one another. Poisoning the way we treat one another.

Former India president dies after Covid diagnosis,"Pranab Mukherjee rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts as president India's former president Pranab Mukherjee has died 21 days after it was confirmed that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The 84-year-old was in hospital to remove a clot in his brain when it was discovered he also had Covid-19. Before serving as president between 2012 and 2017, Mr Mukherjee held several important portfolios during his 51-year political career. These included the finance, foreign and defence ministries.

The job of president is largely ceremonial but becomes crucial when elections throw up fragmented mandates. The president decides which party or coalition can be invited to form a government. Mr Mukherjee didn't have to take such a decision because the mandate was clear during his presidency. But he showed his assertiveness in other decisions, such as rejecting the mercy petitions of several people who had been sentenced to death. Mr Mukherjee also served on the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Most of his career was with the Congress party which dominated Indian politics for decades before suffering two consecutive losses in 2014 and 2019 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Mukherjee joined the party in the 1960s during the tenure of then prime minister Indira Gandhi whom he had described as his mentor. In 1986 he fell out with the Congress leadership and started his own political party, but returned two years later. He regarded former PM Indira Gandhi as his mentor A parliamentarian for 37 years, Mr Mukherjee was widely known as a consensus-builder. Given that consecutive governments before 2014 were built on coalitions, this was an important and valued attribute. However, Mr Mukherjee's larger ambition - of becoming India's prime minister - was never realised. He was overlooked for the post twice - after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 and after his party's unexpected election win in 2004. Manmohan Singh, a trained economist who was chosen as the prime minister, later said that Mr Mukherjee had every reason to feel aggrieved. ""He was better qualified than I was to become the prime minister, but he also knew that I have no choice in the matter,"" Dr Singh said. Pranab Mukherjee was one of India's most astute politicians. As one of the leading figures of the Congress party, he held every key ministry in India - commerce, defence, external affairs and finance - over a chequered half- a-century-long political career. What the diminutive leader lacked as a politician with a mass base - he was mostly elected to the upper house of the parliament - he made up with his keen sense of realpolitik and formidable managerial skills. During the two-term Congress-led government which ended in 2014, Mr Mukherjee deftly negotiated the choppy waters of an unwieldy and often fractious coalition. He worked tirelessly at building consensus on a raft of rights-based legislations relating to matters like food security and right to information that helped his party gain political heft and popularity. His record as a finance minister in the second term was less stellar: the economy overheated, inflation peaked and interest rates went through the roof. Critics called him one of the ""worst"" finance ministers India ever had. As the 13th president of the republic, Mr Mukherjee walked a fine line, having good relations with his party's arch foe and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his own Congress party leaders. In many ways, he was a remarkable exception in the rough and tumble of Indian politics: a calm bipartisan leader and a dour consensus builder with an encyclopaedic memory. When Mr Mukherjee was appointed India's president in 2012, he was widely acknowledged as being the most experienced politician by far to take up the post. His tenure as president saw him reject up to 18 bills that were sent to him for assent. Presidents generally do not reject bills sent to them. He also rejected 30 mercy petitions from death row convicts - the highest by far of any Indian president. As a result, Afzal Guru - convicted of involvement in the 2001 attack on India's parliament was hanged in February 2013. Yakub Memon, who was convicted of financing the 1993 terror attacks in Mumbai, and Ajmal Kasab, one of the gunmen in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, were also hanged during his tenure.

The year that changed Europe,"Five years ago, more than one million people crossed into Europe. Many of them took huge risks and embarked on dangerous journeys in an effort to escape conflict and find a better life. But the sudden influx of people sparked a crisis - both humanitarian and political - as Europe struggled to respond. Thousands died attempting to reach its shores and, while some countries opened their arms, others erected fences and closed their borders. The impact of this mass migration is still being felt today. Here, BBC correspondents, experts and those who made the journey themselves reflect on that dramatic time. How did it change Europe and the lives of those involved? Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My life before the war in 2011 was very good. I was a maths teacher in Aleppo with two children. But as the war started, I knew we had no future in the country. I used to drive to work and see bodies on the side of the road. So I fled to Turkey - it was the easiest option back then. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:Syria's war shot Turkey to the front of the migration story. It borders Greece and Bulgaria, so in many ways it became the EU's waiting room. There was a huge flow of people from Syria to Turkey and then on to Greece in 2015. Julian Miglierini, BBC reporter in Rome:But in Italy, migration had been a big issue for years. Its closeness to North Africa made it a prime destination for those willing to risk crossing the Mediterranean, and many people did. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:That summer in Serbia it was common to see people on the streets who had travelled from the Middle East. They were taking the Balkan route - which wound north through Greece and North Macedonia on the path towards countries like Germany. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My two sisters already lived in Germany. I realised that Turkey was not the future I was looking for for me and my little kids, so I decided to travel there to find better opportunities. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany had been taking in people fleeing war and persecution and it had a reputation as a welcoming country. But when thousands of people arrived at the start of September 2015, a crowd was there to meet them with hand-painted signs and gifts for the exhausted people coming off the trains. They broke into spontaneous applause and cheering - it was an extraordinary moment. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:I arrived in Munich after a long and complicated journey. It was raining cats and dogs! For me that was the first strange thing I noticed... rain in the summer! But I met very nice people who were so open to the refugees. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Similarly, in Sweden, the mood at the time was that this was one of the most welcoming countries anywhere. At stations there were people with banners saying ""refugees welcome"", and a year earlier the prime minister had given a speech asking Swedes to open their hearts to migrants. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:At university they would always talk about how Sweden was welcoming to refugees, so I fled Jordan. I had no choice because my life was in danger. My sister was already in Sweden and we were eventually reunited. When I arrived I thought I was finally free. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:The big shift came when police in North Macedonia fired teargas at people trying to cross the border with Greece. The authorities said they were overwhelmed. It seemed like Europe had suddenly become keenly aware of a problem that had been hiding in plain sight. Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent:And in Hungary the government announced it would erect a fence on its border. Police also sealed off the main railway station in Budapest to stop people travelling further. But the measures just forced people into the hands of smugglers and illegality. Bethany Bell, Austria correspondent:The dead bodies of dozens of migrants were later discovered in the back of a lorry that had travelled from Hungary into Austria. It was a shocking moment that highlighted the issue of people smuggling and the desperation of those caught up in the crisis. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Angela Merkel, like all of us, was horrified by the lorry discovery. It seemed to have a profound impact on her. Just days later she said at least 800,000 people would likely seek asylum in Germany that year. And for the first time she used what would become her catchphrase: ""wir schaffen das"" - we will manage it. Men carry the coffin of a Kurdish man whose body was found in a lorry in Austria Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent:Merkel, in agreement with the Austrian chancellor, agreed to take in those who were left stuck in Hungary. Thousands gave up on Budapest station and marched to Vienna. Hungary's view was essentially: 'If you want these people, you can have them'. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:After I arrived in Munich, I went to two refugee camps before I was moved to a small town in Hessen. We met Germans who wanted to get in contact with refugees and help us integrate. They've been very supportive to me at every stage and I still live there now. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany's approach was to try to ensure that new arrivals were housed all over the country; that no one area should be disproportionately affected. In reality, it became the job of local mayors and authorities to sort the logistics. But they were supported by a remarkable volunteer movement. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Migrant families in Sweden often ended up in remote locations, or in temporary accommodation moving from place to place. And while openness to the new arrivals was the norm, that began to shift as the strain on resources became more apparent. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:Eventually, the Balkan Route was declared closed in March 2016. That helped to reduce the flow of people. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:And a deal struck between the EU and Turkey a few weeks later proved remarkably effective. It stated that Turkey would be given billions in EU aid for agreeing to take back Syrian refugees who arrived on Greek islands. It led to a massive decline in numbers. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:Sweden was very hard at first and people tried to take advantage of me before I was granted refugee status. I have legal status now, and I want to use my degree, but I've come to realise they don't accept foreign qualifications here. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:A lot of people thought Sweden would be paradise but the reality has delivered more challenges than they might have expected. Even highly educated migrants with great English have struggled to progress because their qualifications are invalid. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:I've applied for about 100 jobs and have never been invited to interview. So now I've decided to do what they want and I'm studying for a Swedish diploma. I want to build a future, I want to be independent, but it's been six years and I don't have anything. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Housing and employment have been two of the biggest issues. Sweden has a huge squeeze on accommodation in major cities. Unless you've been in a queue for social housing for years you're reliant on connections. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:One legacy of 2015 is the innovative ways people have addressed issues like housing. In Hamburg and Bremen they actually turned shipping containers into homes for migrants. In Amsterdam, they built a similar ""container city"" that housed 50% young Dutch people and 50% refugees. But there are still issues. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:The unemployment rate for foreign-born citizens is 21.2% vs. 5.5% for those born here. The aim is for new arrivals not to be doing black market jobs, and there has been a debate about whether there should be looser rules that would allow them to work more easily. Samar Jaber, Engineering graduate from Jordan:You cannot feel stable. It feels like every time I do something I get asked for another thing! Do you think I want to stay at home and not work? We all want to work. But there's nothing. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany has an ageing population and the new arrivals were seen by some as an answer to a shortage of skilled workers - big companies like Siemens started to offer apprenticeships. But inevitably there were problems and the migration issue dominated society for several years. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Crimes committed by asylum seekers dominated headlines. The attacks on young women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 at the hands of men who came - in the main - from North Africa fuelled anger as did the terror attack on a Berlin Christmas market, perpetrated by a Tunisian man who had come to Europe as an asylum seeker. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Crime has become part of the immigration debate here, too. There have been high-profile incidents, but police will tell you that crime in certain high-immigration areas is largely not from recent arrivals but from criminal networks and gangs. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:There was a backlash against Merkel's ""we can manage"" policies, and she soon dropped the slogan as support for the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party grew. ""FlÃ¼chtlingspolitik"" (refugee politics) polarised society. Julian Miglierini, BBC reporter in Rome:In Italy, nationalists exploited a perceived lack of co-operation from the EU and fellow European countries during the crisis. They've expressed anti-migrant sentiments and the message has clicked with many Italians. Nationalists have certainly had electoral success here since. Daphne Halikiopoulou, professor of European politics:The trend we've seen in Europe, starting from the economic crisis and then continuing with the migrant crisis, is the shrinking of the mainstream and the rise of nationalist policies. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:The nationalist Sweden Democrats have got more attention here since the crisis and have gained in popularity. It's become more acceptable to voice anti-immigration views, and a cap on numbers has been introduced and even adopted as a policy by the centre-left. Bethany Bell, Austria correspondent:The crisis has brought about significant change in Austrian politics. Opposing immigration has been a huge theme for Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  His anti-migrant message helped him win two elections and take votes away from the far-right. It's still a dominant issue for his conservative party. Daphne Halikiopoulou, professor of European politics:The actual immigration numbers often don't correspond with people voting for a particular party. What's more important is how voters perceive the crisis and how it's portrayed. In this way, parties have been able to influence mainstream politics in a way that they weren't before. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:Some nationalist politicians have attempted to use the crisis to stir up support. In general, sympathy for the plight of those coming up the Balkan Route appears to have declined. People are protesting against asylum centres and compassion fatigue has taken root. Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent: And in Hungary the conservative Fidesz government has used the crisis to bolster its own support. This, combined with an economic boom, made them unbeatable in 2018. Daphne Halikiopoulou, Professor of European politics:We can understand the impact of the migrant crisis mostly in terms of the opportunity it presented to [nationalist] parties to increase their support. And I think we'll continue to see these parties becoming more embedded in the political mainstream. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:In places like Sweden and Germany, which saw the largest number of arrivals, they were faced with a less orderly approach to addressing integration. But there was a huge, grassroots volunteering effort, which was one of the most positive things to come out of the situation. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:But it's still difficult for immigrants to climb the ladder. Sooner rather than later we might see how things pan out for the children who came here and are approaching the age where they'll enter the job market. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:That will be the moment when Sweden knows whether its response has been a success or not. It has an ageing population, so to suddenly receive an injection of 40,000 young and able people could prove a major success. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:In Germany, schools recruited extra teachers and people from other professions were fast-tracked through training to boost numbers. Extra classes were set up for children who shared no common language. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My daughter is doing very well at school here. We both speak German fluently and have a lot of friends. She's ambitious and I want her to do better than I have done. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Many of those who arrived have integrated, learned the language, and built new lives. It's by no means perfect and there are still plenty of problems but hundreds of thousands of people - Syrians, Iraqis, and many others - are putting down roots. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:It has really changed the fabric of Istanbul. Some streets there have exclusively Syrian shops, restaurants and cafes. And a lot of those Syrians actually want to stay in Turkey now because they're settled and it's a safe country. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:Sweden is a very generous country. It's changed me - I used to be afraid of many things but now I feel different. I'm preparing to study for a master's degree and I hope I'll be able to fulfil my dreams. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:I'm looking forward to getting my German passport. We decided to come here to have better lives and to live with dignity and security, and our life here is very good. Some names have been changed to protect identities. EU migration: Crisis in seven charts Â© 2025 BBC.

Jockey Club boss quits over bullying claims,"Delia Bushell had been Jockey club chief executive since September 2019 The chief executive of the Jockey Club has resigned after an independent inquiry upheld allegations of bullying, racist comments and the circulation of offensive material. Delia Bushell, who had been in the role since September 2019, tendered her resignation on Sunday, having been informed that disciplinary action had begun ""on the grounds of gross misconduct"". It is understood the barrister who led the investigation also found evidence of witness tampering by Bushell. The Jockey Club's board concluded it was ""untenable"" for her to remain in the position. The Jockey Club - which operates 15 racecourses including Aintree, Cheltenham, Newmarket and Epsom Downs - announced it has appointed Nevin Truesdale as acting group chief executive following Bushell's sudden departure. In a letterpublished in the Racing Post,,externalBushell expressed her ""shock and sadness"" at the decision. She added: ""I have been subjected to unmerited, dishonourable, bullying behaviour by people I previously held in high regard and trusted. ""Given the toxicity of the working environment I find myself in, the predetermination of the disciplinary and the clear and ongoing threats to my reputation, I have no choice but to accept the repudiatory conduct described in this letter and to resign with immediate effect."" The England and Wales Cricket Board - where Bushell is a director - said in a statement: ""We do not underestimate the seriousness of the claims made against Delia, but we will seek to review and discuss what is clearly a complex matter with both her and the Jockey Club before commenting further."" Bushell is also on the board of Commonwealth Games England. A spokesperson for Commonwealth Games England said: ""We are aware of reports in the media concerning Delia Bushell and will not make any further comment until we have reviewed the situation.""

Sturgeon 'concerned' over 160 new virus casesScotland's first minister voices concerns about a fresh increase in coronavirus cases.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus in Scotland: No 'one-size-fits-all approach' for local lockdowns Nicola Sturgeon has voiced concerns after 160 more people tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland. The latest increase in new cases follows123 reported on Sunday, with a number of ""clusters"" across Scotland. The first minister said the rise in cases was ""partly the result of a greater number of people being tested"". But she said it was ""undoubtedly a concern"" and that any connection between cases was being ""carefully considered"" by health protection teams. A total of 69 of the new cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with Ms Sturgeon saying ""particularly close attention"" was being paid to this. However, she stressed that the positive results ""still represent less than 1% of people newly tested yesterday"". The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased to 258, five of whom are in intensive care. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The first minister said it appeared the figures in the Glasgow area ""seem to reflect a number of small clusters, rather than one or two more significant outbreaks"". She said ministers would consider whether any targeted action would be needed in the area, although she stressed that this might not necessarily mean a local lockdown - noting that ""lockdown increasingly means different things in different circumstances"". Another 27 cases were reported in Lanarkshire, 18 in Lothian, and eight in Ayrshire and Arran - with Ms Sturgeon warning that the latter ""seem to be linked to indoor gatherings"". However, there were just four new cases in the Grampian area, with Ms Sturgeon saying this was ""further indication that the Aberdeen pub cluster is contained"". Swimming pools are now able to reopen to the public The first minister said the fact that the number of cases reflected an increase in tests was ""an important bit of context to keep in mind"". But she added: ""The number is a reminder to all of us that the virus is still a very real risk, it is a development that concerns me and it is one we are taking seriously."" The increase in cases comes as the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in Scotland comes into force, withgyms and swimming pools reopening. Ms Sturgeon said: ""As we release ourselves from lockdown, we release the virus from lockdown too. ""Please follow the guidance - that's the only way we can make sure these reopenings can happen safely, and they don't spark an increase in transmission that could take us all back again. ""The figures demonstrate very clearly that this virus is still present across the country. The clusters we have seen show it will spread very rapidly if it gets the chance, and the admissions to intensive care last week remind us that the virus is still immensely dangerous for some people.""

Eat Out to Help Out discount comes to an end,"This video can not be played ""I think it is going to be a tough winter"" The government's Eat Out to Help Out discount ends on Monday, having been praised by many of the restaurants, cafes and pubs it was designed to help. Businesses say the scheme - which gives diners 50% off, up to Â£10 - has successfully tempted more people to eat out again after lockdown was eased. Many want the scheme extended, with one restaurant owner saying the ""biggest worry"" will be in October and November. Research suggests trade on some days in August was twice last year's levels. The discount scheme - which finishes today - has applied to sit-in meals and soft drinks, Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limit to the number of times it could be used. 'I saved Â£200 doing Eat Out to Help Out every day' Restaurants extend discount dining into September Some 84,000 outlets signed up, with claims made for more than 64 million meals, according to the most recently released Treasury statistics. OpenTable data indicates there were 106% more seated diners last Tuesday than the same day in 2019. But there are now calls for the scheme to be extended or return later in the year, amid fears the benefits will be short lived. The boss of pub chain Greene King told the BBC that, while some of its 3,100 locations had seen a huge boost to sales, city centre sites were still struggling, particularly in London. Andy Lennox runs the two Zim Braai restaurants in Bournemouth, which specialise in African food. He also founded The Wonky Table, a network of around 500 hospitality firms in the area. His business survived the lockdown by using the government's emergency support schemes, including bounceback loans. Eat Out to Help Out has helped him recoup some of his losses. ""Trade's record-breaking at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""It is a false bubble so we're not getting too excited, but Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are up probably 100% [on last year]. The week's up 50%. Thursday has pivoted - it's the new Monday."" Mr Lennox credits high numbers of tourists in Bournemouth this summer for some of the rise. He does not mind trade being drawn away from the weekend, saying reduced capacity due to social distancing means he could not cope with bumper Saturdays. The Sinyinza family Customers at the nearby Olive CafÃ© last Wednesday told us they had taken advantage of the cheaper meals multiple times ""This week we've done breakfast, dinner, breakfast, dinner,"" said Jasmine Sinyinza, visiting the town with her family. ""We probably would not have gone out as much without it"". ""We had to book the restaurants before we left home to get the availability, because it's so popular,"" added her mum, Michelle Sinyinza. A waiter at the Spyglass and Kettle wearing personal protective equipment Joanne Botta, general manager of the Spyglass and Kettle - a Greene King pub - in nearby Southbourne, said some regulars were still wary about venturing out. Nonetheless, there had been surge in evening bookings. ""The challenge has been getting the ordering right and getting the team levels right, but it feels good to have our pubs packed."" Research by food and drink consultancy CGA suggested that across the whole of the scheme's third week, food sales were 15% higher than in the equivalent period in 2019. It found sales were also growing between Thursday and Sunday, although sales on those four days remained well below last year. However there is evidence that while places with high levels of visitors and tourists like Bournemouth saw a significant boost, other locations continued to struggle. Diners at the Spyglass and Kettle pub Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of Greene King, told the BBC that some of his sites continued to see low footfall. ""While a lot of our businesses were 50%, 70%, 90% up year-on-year, central London was about 30% down. It is pretty stark. ""I've called for the government to think about maybe doing a similar scheme for city centres and for London. We need to get people back into cities particularly into central London."" Some restaurants have committed tocarrying on some form of discount for longer. One of them is Comptoir CafÃ© and Wine in central London, which will continue offering a 50% discount on Mondays to Wednesdays in September, thanks to its landlord Grosvenor subsidising the deal. Manager Sabrina Barreiros said her business still needs a boost after a dire July: ""It will help us a lot with trade, and we'll have people who are back to work in the offices as well."" Sabrina Barreiros at the Comptoir cafe in central London Mr Lennox in Bournemouth will continue to offer 25% off up to Â£5 in September. However he said there was anxiety among hospitality firms about the autumn, calling for the Eat Out to Help Out subsidy to be revived later in the year. ""Give September that breathing space, let the schools open. Then bring it back in October and November where predominantly it's going to be the quietest part of the year. That's where the biggest worry is."" He said venues in his area faced a dilemma over hiring extra staff to cope with the huge demand in August, when it was unclear whether they'd have enough hours for those teams in the quiet months. On Monday chancellor Rishi Sunak thanked diners for helping to protect 1.8 million jobs in the hospitality sector. ""The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery,"" he said. The government doesn't plan to extend the scheme, but a Treasury spokesperson said other support for hospitality goes beyond August. They highlighted the furlough scheme - which comes to an end in October - and the temporary VAT cut to 5%.

"Scottish gyms and swimming pools reopenAfter five months of lockdown, indoor sports and fitness can start up again under Covid restrictions.","This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish gyms and pools reopen Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts can now reopen in Scotland after the coronavirus lockdown. After almost 24 weeks, venues are able to open afterNicola Sturgeon brought the planned date for some indoor sports forwardby two weeks. It comes as the requirement for school pupils to wear face coverings also comes into effect. Secondary pupils will wear them between classes and all pupils will wear them on school transport. The reopening of indoor sports halls followsweeks of pressure from the fitness industryand sports governing bodies. They argued that strict safety measures would allow them to open safely. Why have Scotland's pubs opened before its gyms? Fear of 'long term damage' to Scottish gymnastics Rink closures threat to ice hockey club's future Over 12s can take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios. Younger children can do all activity. The gym and swimming pool at Inverness Leisure Centre opened at midnight. People were back in the gym in Inverness as soon as it opened Lee Crawford was one of the first in when the doors opened. ""I had nothing on tomorrow so thought I'd get a couple of hours tonight,"" he said. ""I haven't lifted heavy weights in a wee while, just been stuck in the garage with light weights. ""I thought it would be busier than this."" Social distancing measures have been put in place at the Inverness gym Swim coach Kirsty Ewan, who was back in the pool just after midnight, said: ""I was just a bit excited. I think it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. ""I spend a large proportion of my life here, coaching and swimming myself, so to be away for so long I just wanted to come back at the first opportunity. ""I've definitely missed being in the pool. I've done some open-water swimming in lochs but there's nothing quite like being in the pool with the smell of chlorine and things, so it's really nice to be back."" Gym owner Steven Morley opened the doors of his New Age Fitness gyms in Hamilton and Coatbridge at 06:00. He told the BBC his staff had been working non-stop to get safety measures in place. Steven said: ""It's been tough but we knew this was just temporary. To watch the members walk back through the doors will be absolutely amazing and will make all the hard work myself and the staff have put in the last few weeks worth it."" Gymnastics clubs were also waiting to welcome back their athletes. West Lothian Gym Club made videos to show its members its anti-virus measures West Lothian Gymnastics Club in Livingston was previously the only club in Scotland allowed to open as it welcomed just five high performance gymnasts but it was preparing to welcome its younger gymnasts on Monday. The club has shared videos showing the children how one-way systems and ""gym bubbles"" will work. Head women's coach Becki Campbell said: ""We have managed to prepare well in advance so we are ready. On Monday we welcome two recreational classes and five competitive groups. ""We have also been doing gymnast workshops on Zoom. We were worried some would not feel ready but they absolutely are."" The Gold Star cheerleaders know training will be very different now with restrictions in place Even dance schools have had to mark out the floor to keep children socially distanced Dance schools also have the go-ahead to open. Scotland's most successful cheerleading squad, Gold Star in Glasgow said it had made sure its studio was as safe as it could be. Owner Claire McCreath said: ""We have spent the whole week deep cleaning, then doing it again and again. We are relieved, excited and ready to roll and it will be the best feeling to see and hear the people in real life."" Many of Scotland's public and charitable trust-run pools and gyms are taking a slower approach. One issue is the viability of reopening if customer numbers are low and operational costs high. While High Life Highland, which operates sport and leisure facilities in the area, says all of its leisure facilities will reopen today, others have said some facilities will not reopen until October. Different arrangements are in place for each area. For example, although most of the facilities run by Live Argyll are reopening today, pre-booking will be required and limited to members only for the first four weeks. Pools will be open for lane swimming only and there will be a minimum age of eight. In the Borders, the trust that runs leisure facilities on behalf of the council has started a phased reopening of its facilities. Live Life Aberdeenshire is taking the same approach. But in Dumfries and Galloway, the council is working towards having its sites across the region - including the flagship DG1 centre - open by 14 September. In Angus, the seven Angus Live sport and leisure venues will not reopen until after 14 September. The operators say it is to allow for safety procedures to be put in place and for staff to be trained. No dates have been given for when pools in the area will reopen. Similarly in South Lanarkshire, fitness classes will not resume until 14 September and gyms will reopen the following week. Pools will not open until Monday 5 October. North Ayrshire Swimming Club will resume training in the water in two weeks. Swimmer Isla Waller has been training by Zoom for five months and only recently started land training and braving outdoor swimming. After missing her national championships she is ready to get back and more than willing to wait a little longer. Isla, like a lot of swimmers and athletes who train in local authority facilities, will have to wait a bit longer to get back The 13-year-old told the BBC: ""I was so excited when we heard the date. My mum texted me at school to tell me. ""It will be different when we get back to the pool but we will be fine. ""It will be good to see friends because we don't get to see everyone at land training."" More restrictions will be lifted on 14 September. Sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues will be able to reopen with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions.

Hotel Rwanda film hero arrested on terror chargesPaul Rusesabagina's efforts to save people during the Rwanda genocide was depicted in a film.,"Paul Rusesabagina has criticised Rwanda's President Paul Kagame A man who inspired a Hollywood film about the 1994 Rwandan genocide has been arrested for leading ""terrorist movements"", officials say. Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, became well known after Hotel Rwanda depicted his efforts to save hundreds of Tutsis at his hotel during the 1994 genocide. He later launched an opposition party, which had an armed wing based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the genocide. They were killed by Hutu extremists who were forced from power by President Paul Kagame and his Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories Rwanda genocide: 100 days of slaughter 'I am a mother - I killed some children's parents' Mr Rusesabagina, 66, has received several human rights awards for his life-saving efforts, including the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. He was paraded by the authorities at a press conference in the capital, Kigali, after he was arrested under an international warrant. He had been living in exile. The authorities did not say where he was arrested or give any further details about the accusations he faces. Don Cheadle (L) played Mr Rusesabagina (R) in the film Mr Rusesabagina's name featured recently in a terrorism case in Rwanda. The court heard allegations that the National Liberation Front (FLN) rebel group had received help from Zambia's President Edgar Lungu because of his close friendship with Mr Rusesabagina. Mr Lungu's spokesman denied the allegation in a BBC interview. In 2011, Mr Rusesabagina was accused of funding subversion in Rwanda, but no charges were brought. At the time, he denied any wrongdoing and said there was a smear campaign against him. President Kagame's critics accuse him of not tolerating any opposition. Several opposition leaders have been jailed and others fled into exile. He says he is trying to prevent a return of ethnic hatred. The 2004 film Hotel Rwanda told the story of how Mr Rusesabagina, a middle-class Hutu married to a Tutsi, used his influence - and bribes - to convince military officials to secure a safe escape for an estimated 1,200 people who sought shelter at the Mille Collines Hotel in Kigali. Don Cheadle played Mr Rusesabagina in the film. Rwandan genocide survivors' group Ibuka has in the past said that he exaggerated his own role in helping hotel refugees escape the 100-day slaughter. This video can not be played Between April and July 1994, an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days. 'My father, the rapist': Hidden victims of Rwanda's genocide The radio show which brought children back from the dead The genocide orphans still searching for their names In 2007, Mr Rusesabagina said a UN-backed war crimes court should put some members of the RPF on trial for their alleged role in the genocide. ""I'm just a normal person. But I've always defended human rights,"" he said at the time. ""I'm trying to be the voice of millions of Rwandese who have no-one to speak out for them.""

Capita to close over a third of offices permanently,"Capita manages London's congestion charge Outsourcing firm Capita is to close over a third of its offices in the UK permanently, the BBC understands. The firm, which is a major government contractor, is to end its leases on almost 100 workplaces. Business lobby group CBI has warned that the fall in office working is damaging city centre economies. It comes as the government prepares tolaunch an advertising campaign encouraging more people to return to workplaces. The BBC understands that Capita, which manages London's congestion charge, has been looking at various measures to help it simplify its business for some time, such as embracing more flexible working, which is supported by its employees. So far, Capita has decided not to renew leases on 25 offices. 'We're at a moment of real change in the world of work' Coronavirus: Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if staff do not return to the office A Capita spokesman said: ""We take seriously the responsibilities we have to the communities in which we operate and are mindful of the impact that potential office closures could have on small businesses. ""Capita's 45,000 employees work in offices spread right across towns and cities in the UK - we are committed to that continuing both now and in the long term. ""Following dialogue with our employees it has become very clear that they would like to work in a more flexible way, which will involve increased working from home, but they will still spend a significant amount of their time working from offices that are based in the heart of our local communities."" According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, there was a taboo around flexible working prior to the pandemic - but seeing how employees worked from home during the coronavirus lockdown has opened the eyes of many employers. Flexible working is no longer viewed as being taboo by employers, showing a shift from ""presenteeism"" ""It's the biggest experiment we've ever had in homeworking,"" the CIPD's chief executive Peter Cheesetold the BBCin an interview in July. ""Bosses are starting to shift towards judging output, rather than the number of hours spent in front of the computer."" A recent BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to reassure the public that it is safe for more people to return to workplaces, the CIPD is more circumspect about ensuring that employees do not feel pressured to do so. The CIPD wants employers to consider: Is returning to the workplace essential? Is it sufficiently safe to do so? Is it mutually agreed with the worker? ""Working from home has proved to be a great success for many individuals and organisations. Recent CIPD research found that a majority of employers believe that homeworkers are either as productive as other workers, or more productive,"" said Mr Cheese. ""However, it's important that all employers take steps to support their employees' mental health and address concerns they may have while they work from home."" The CIPD says managers should be regularly checking in with their staff, discussing their well-being and wherever possible, ensuring decisions over working from home or returning to the workplace ""are based on individual choice and preference"". But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned this week that the thousands of local businesses relying on the passing trade of office workers are suffering. City centres could become ""ghost towns""if employees do not return to work, stressed CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Both the CBI and the CIPD are in favour of using effective test and trace systems. However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. Lloyds Bank is reviewing its office space needs after concluding its staff worked well from home during lockdown The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. However, the CIPD doesn't feel that masses of white-collar workers will end up working from home permanently as a cost-cutting measure. Instead, it thinks office spaces will become places where just some staff are based, or that employees work in the office at different times and on different days on a rotation, and that the office space will be used more for face-to-face meetings. âWe're at moment of real change in world of workâ Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Eat out discount scheme extended by restaurants,"Some businesses in Wales are extending the discount scheme from their own pockets The UK government's restaurant discount scheme is to be continued by a number of businesses in Wales through September - at their own expense. Eat Out to Help Out is due to come to an end on Monday, having been launched to help the hospitality industry. It offered a 50% discount, up to Â£10 per person, off meals and soft drinks. But some cafes and restaurants - including chains and independents - have opted to keep offering the discount. Pub owners Brains are extending their scheme until September 9. Will the 'eat out to help out scheme' be extended? The highs and lows of the coronavirus discount scheme Eat Out to Help Out discount used 64m times in three weeks UK chains Harvester, Tesco Cafe and Toby Carvery are among those who have said they will continue the scheme for part or all of September. Cardiff's Philharmonic decided to keep the offer open after seeing ""unprecedented"" table bookings at the beginning of the week. Pub manager Nick Newman said continuing the scheme was a ""business decision"" Manager Nick Newman said it was a ""business decision"" to continue with the offer for another month but thinks it will give ""customers more confidence to come back out"". Welsh Government guidelines mean restaurants are working in a new way. The Philharmonic was ""getting used to us serving and [customers] being served"" in a way that ensured customers and staff stayed safe. Some businesses have introduced apps to cut interaction between customers and staff. Others have brought in one-way systems and screens between tables. Customers reacted ""really well"" just to the pub being open, he said ""Customers have reacted really, really, well - they've just reacted well to the fact we've reopened at all,"" said Mr Newman. ""I think we're on that path of re-presenting the business to our customers and again just to give them the confidence to come back to town and come back to our businesses."" Geoff Dower, who runs High Tide Inn in Porthcawl, said it has been two or three times better than on a normal Tuesday in August and Wednesdays have also been very busy. ""We did over 1,200 meals on Wednesday and 900 on Tuesday [last week],"" he said adding the scheme will continue at the large venue. ""It's helped the cash flow situation. [Extending] it will hit the profit a bit, but it will keep staff in work this winter.""

"Eat Out to Help Out discount comes to an endBusinesses want the scheme to be extended, saying October and November are the ""biggest worry"".Business","This video can not be played ""I think it is going to be a tough winter"" The government's Eat Out to Help Out discount ends on Monday, having been praised by many of the restaurants, cafes and pubs it was designed to help. Businesses say the scheme - which gives diners 50% off, up to Â£10 - has successfully tempted more people to eat out again after lockdown was eased. Many want the scheme extended, with one restaurant owner saying the ""biggest worry"" will be in October and November. Research suggests trade on some days in August was twice last year's levels. The discount scheme - which finishes today - has applied to sit-in meals and soft drinks, Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limit to the number of times it could be used. 'I saved Â£200 doing Eat Out to Help Out every day' Restaurants extend discount dining into September Some 84,000 outlets signed up, with claims made for more than 64 million meals, according to the most recently released Treasury statistics. OpenTable data indicates there were 106% more seated diners last Tuesday than the same day in 2019. But there are now calls for the scheme to be extended or return later in the year, amid fears the benefits will be short lived. The boss of pub chain Greene King told the BBC that, while some of its 3,100 locations had seen a huge boost to sales, city centre sites were still struggling, particularly in London. Andy Lennox runs the two Zim Braai restaurants in Bournemouth, which specialise in African food. He also founded The Wonky Table, a network of around 500 hospitality firms in the area. His business survived the lockdown by using the government's emergency support schemes, including bounceback loans. Eat Out to Help Out has helped him recoup some of his losses. ""Trade's record-breaking at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""It is a false bubble so we're not getting too excited, but Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are up probably 100% [on last year]. The week's up 50%. Thursday has pivoted - it's the new Monday."" Mr Lennox credits high numbers of tourists in Bournemouth this summer for some of the rise. He does not mind trade being drawn away from the weekend, saying reduced capacity due to social distancing means he could not cope with bumper Saturdays. The Sinyinza family Customers at the nearby Olive CafÃ© last Wednesday told us they had taken advantage of the cheaper meals multiple times ""This week we've done breakfast, dinner, breakfast, dinner,"" said Jasmine Sinyinza, visiting the town with her family. ""We probably would not have gone out as much without it"". ""We had to book the restaurants before we left home to get the availability, because it's so popular,"" added her mum, Michelle Sinyinza. A waiter at the Spyglass and Kettle wearing personal protective equipment Joanne Botta, general manager of the Spyglass and Kettle - a Greene King pub - in nearby Southbourne, said some regulars were still wary about venturing out. Nonetheless, there had been surge in evening bookings. ""The challenge has been getting the ordering right and getting the team levels right, but it feels good to have our pubs packed."" Research by food and drink consultancy CGA suggested that across the whole of the scheme's third week, food sales were 15% higher than in the equivalent period in 2019. It found sales were also growing between Thursday and Sunday, although sales on those four days remained well below last year. However there is evidence that while places with high levels of visitors and tourists like Bournemouth saw a significant boost, other locations continued to struggle. Diners at the Spyglass and Kettle pub Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of Greene King, told the BBC that some of his sites continued to see low footfall. ""While a lot of our businesses were 50%, 70%, 90% up year-on-year, central London was about 30% down. It is pretty stark. ""I've called for the government to think about maybe doing a similar scheme for city centres and for London. We need to get people back into cities particularly into central London."" Some restaurants have committed tocarrying on some form of discount for longer. One of them is Comptoir CafÃ© and Wine in central London, which will continue offering a 50% discount on Mondays to Wednesdays in September, thanks to its landlord Grosvenor subsidising the deal. Manager Sabrina Barreiros said her business still needs a boost after a dire July: ""It will help us a lot with trade, and we'll have people who are back to work in the offices as well."" Sabrina Barreiros at the Comptoir cafe in central London Mr Lennox in Bournemouth will continue to offer 25% off up to Â£5 in September. However he said there was anxiety among hospitality firms about the autumn, calling for the Eat Out to Help Out subsidy to be revived later in the year. ""Give September that breathing space, let the schools open. Then bring it back in October and November where predominantly it's going to be the quietest part of the year. That's where the biggest worry is."" He said venues in his area faced a dilemma over hiring extra staff to cope with the huge demand in August, when it was unclear whether they'd have enough hours for those teams in the quiet months. On Monday chancellor Rishi Sunak thanked diners for helping to protect 1.8 million jobs in the hospitality sector. ""The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery,"" he said. The government doesn't plan to extend the scheme, but a Treasury spokesperson said other support for hospitality goes beyond August. They highlighted the furlough scheme - which comes to an end in October - and the temporary VAT cut to 5%.

"Capita to close over a third of offices permanentlyThe firm, which manages London's congestion charge, is attempting to simplify its business.Business","Capita manages London's congestion charge Outsourcing firm Capita is to close over a third of its offices in the UK permanently, the BBC understands. The firm, which is a major government contractor, is to end its leases on almost 100 workplaces. Business lobby group CBI has warned that the fall in office working is damaging city centre economies. It comes as the government prepares tolaunch an advertising campaign encouraging more people to return to workplaces. The BBC understands that Capita, which manages London's congestion charge, has been looking at various measures to help it simplify its business for some time, such as embracing more flexible working, which is supported by its employees. So far, Capita has decided not to renew leases on 25 offices. 'We're at a moment of real change in the world of work' Coronavirus: Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if staff do not return to the office A Capita spokesman said: ""We take seriously the responsibilities we have to the communities in which we operate and are mindful of the impact that potential office closures could have on small businesses. ""Capita's 45,000 employees work in offices spread right across towns and cities in the UK - we are committed to that continuing both now and in the long term. ""Following dialogue with our employees it has become very clear that they would like to work in a more flexible way, which will involve increased working from home, but they will still spend a significant amount of their time working from offices that are based in the heart of our local communities."" According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, there was a taboo around flexible working prior to the pandemic - but seeing how employees worked from home during the coronavirus lockdown has opened the eyes of many employers. Flexible working is no longer viewed as being taboo by employers, showing a shift from ""presenteeism"" ""It's the biggest experiment we've ever had in homeworking,"" the CIPD's chief executive Peter Cheesetold the BBCin an interview in July. ""Bosses are starting to shift towards judging output, rather than the number of hours spent in front of the computer."" A recent BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to reassure the public that it is safe for more people to return to workplaces, the CIPD is more circumspect about ensuring that employees do not feel pressured to do so. The CIPD wants employers to consider: Is returning to the workplace essential? Is it sufficiently safe to do so? Is it mutually agreed with the worker? ""Working from home has proved to be a great success for many individuals and organisations. Recent CIPD research found that a majority of employers believe that homeworkers are either as productive as other workers, or more productive,"" said Mr Cheese. ""However, it's important that all employers take steps to support their employees' mental health and address concerns they may have while they work from home."" The CIPD says managers should be regularly checking in with their staff, discussing their well-being and wherever possible, ensuring decisions over working from home or returning to the workplace ""are based on individual choice and preference"". But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned this week that the thousands of local businesses relying on the passing trade of office workers are suffering. City centres could become ""ghost towns""if employees do not return to work, stressed CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Both the CBI and the CIPD are in favour of using effective test and trace systems. However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. Lloyds Bank is reviewing its office space needs after concluding its staff worked well from home during lockdown The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. However, the CIPD doesn't feel that masses of white-collar workers will end up working from home permanently as a cost-cutting measure. Instead, it thinks office spaces will become places where just some staff are based, or that employees work in the office at different times and on different days on a rotation, and that the office space will be used more for face-to-face meetings. âWe're at moment of real change in world of workâ Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Schools minister was warned about exam algorithm,"This video can not be played Gibb 'reassured' over algorithm concerns Schools Minister Nick Gibb says he was warned about potential problems with the algorithm for moderating A level and GCSE results back in July. His boss, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, had previously said the problemsbecame ""clear"" last weekend. But Mr Gibb said he was made aware of concerns by the former top official at the Department for Education. Sir Jon Coles told him that poorer students could be disadvantaged by the system for moderating exam results. The Times newspaper reported,externalthat Sir Jon, who is now the chief executive of a group of academies and fee paying schools, warned Mr Williamson about potential problems six weeks ago. Is exam chaos costing the Tories support? How did the exam algorithm work? Students to be offered first choice places Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government ""was warned weeks ago that their algorithm might not treat students fairly - I'd like to know what they've been doing since then."" Asked if Mr Williamson should step down following the problems with exam results, leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross said: ""I'm not here to say... that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue - I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England."" And senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I'm concerned that there's a sort of a pattern setting in under this government that something goes wrong and it's the permanent secretary's fault or it is some public body's fault but its never the government's fault. ""Ministers have to make decisions - they either support their people or they get rid of them and get new people and they can't have a half-way house."" Mr Gibb, who first became a schools minister in 2010, told BBC Breakfast he had been ""concerned"" about the issues raised by Sir Jon and had called a meeting with the regulator Ofqual, and other senior officials, to ""discuss it in great detail"". But he said he was ""reassured"" the algorithm would not have that effect. The algorithm downgraded around 40% of last week's A-level results, leading to a public outcry and concerns about GCSEs. Nick Gibb is making a distinction between the overall model designed to avoid grade inflation and its flawed implementation. ""The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it,"" Mr Gibb said earlier, defending the government's approach to grading. ""It became clear that there were some results that were being published on Thursday and Friday that were just not right and they were not what the model had intended."" This distinction matters because ministers are responsible for the overall model, and Ofqual devised the implementation. But that doesn't let ministers off the hook. Plenty of people were flagging up concerns weeks ago and many Tory MPs think Gavin Williamson should have seen the problems coming The exam moderation system also came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. On Monday, the government was forced into a U-turn and reverted to teacher-assessed grades for both A levels and GCSEs, ditching the algorithm. The decision came after similar moves in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Mr Gibb stood by the ""model"" the government and Ofqual agreed for regulating results. But he claimed the ""application of the model in practice... gave rise to problems"". The schools minister apologised to students for the ""pain, anxiety and the uncertainty that they have suffered as a consequence of the grading issues that we encountered last week"". This video can not be played Labour's Kate Green on results: ""What on Earth has been going on?"" The government and universitieshave now agreedthat all students in England who got the A-level grades they needed will be offered a place at their first choice university. In addition, the government has agreed to lift the cap on numbers at medical schools and to put in additional funding for high cost courses such as some sciences. In a letter to vice-chancellors, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Where a provider reaches capacity"" then ""providers will see if a student would like a suitable alternative course or offer a deferred place, and where possible try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year"".

"'Covidiots' criticised on Tui quarantine flightMask rules were ignored on a Zante flight where everyone was told to self-isolate, a passenger says.Wales","Nearly 200 passengers on a flight back from the Greek island of Zante have been told to self-isolate A flight from Zante which left nearly 200 people facing two weeks' self-isolation was a ""debacle"" and a ""free-for-all"", passengers say. One traveller said the Tui flight was full of ""covidiots"" and ""inept crew who couldn't care less"". Another claimed there ""wasn't much"" policing of rules. Sixteen passengers on flight TOM6215 from the Greek island to Cardiff have now tested positive. Tui said safety was a priority and it was concerned by the claims. ""Our crew are trained to the highest standards,"" the airline said. ""A full investigation is now under way as these concerns weren't reported during the flight or before today."" The 193 passengers and crew who were on board the flight on 25 August are being asked to self-isolate for a fortnight. Health officials said seven people from three different parties are believed to have been potentially infectious on board the aircraft. How to fly during a global pandemic What are the latest social distancing rules? Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar told BBC Radio Wales people returning from Zante in particular are ""picking up the infection and are coming to our attention"". Greece and its islandsremain on the UK government's list of quarantine-exempt countries, meaning travellers do not need to self-isolate on their return. But the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated itstravel advice,externalfor Zante on 29 August to reflect local coronavirus restrictions put in place on the island. Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to self-isolate before they had even learned about the positive cases. ""This flight was a debacle. The chap next to me had his mask around his neck. Not only did the airline not pull him up on it, they gave him a free drink when he said he knew a member of the crew,"" Ms Whitfield said. ""Loads of people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others. ""As soon as the flight landed, a load of people took their masks off immediately. The flight was full of selfish 'covidiots' and an inept crew who couldn't care less."" Stephanie Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to isolate for two weeks before learning about the positive cases Ms Whitfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on. ""But the vast majority of people weren't being spoken to, and there was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn't say anything to him [about the mask],"" she said. The couple have now sent off for a test as they are experiencing mild symptoms, she added. Victoria Webb is concerned she only found out about the outbreak from a media report Victoria Webb was also on the flight and said she only became aware of the outbreak when her mother sent her a link to the BBC News story as she travelled home to London from Cardiff. ""I was surprised and slightly at a loss as to what the best course of action was as I was mid-journey,"" she said. ""I spoke to the train manager who was concerned but professional and eventually, after some discussion with his head office, moved me to a carriage where I was alone for the remainder of the journey. ""We also swapped details so I could inform him when I had my test result back."" She has now quarantined in line with government advice, but said she has received no communication from health bodies, such as track and trace. ""The contact forms are there to be used and communication should be swift and thorough so we know process is being followed and can measure its effectiveness,"" she added Governmentguidance for airline passengers states it is mandatory,externalfor travellers in Wales, England and Scotland to wear face coverings on board aircraft, while they are recommended in Northern Ireland. Passengers should remain seated ""as much as possible"" and ""follow instructions and guidance from crew"", it adds. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) recommends mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew as one of several actions to reduce what it says is the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft. Additional measures proposed: Temperature screening of passengers, airport workers and travellers Boarding and alighting processes that reduce contact with other passengers or crew Limiting movement within the cabin during flight More frequent and deeper cabin cleaning Simplified catering procedures to lower crew movement and interaction with passengers Iata does not recommend restricting the use of the middle seat to create social distancing while onboard aircraft. Another passenger on the flight, Lee Evans, described chaotic scenes at Zante airport where he said staff members handled passengers' phones to check boarding passes. ""It was a free-for-all to get on the plane,"" he told the BBC. ""There were people switching seats."" Lee Evans said passengers were not keeping 2m apart at the gate before boarding the flight While the requirement to wear masks was reinforced on board, Mr Evans added: ""There wasn't much in terms of policing what customers were doing on the aeroplane."" He described an email telling him and his family to self-isolate - which came almost a week after the flight - as a ""shock"". ""Someone needs to be held to account,"" he said. Another passenger, who only wanted to be identified as Lewis, said he had flown 11 times in the last six weeks with various airlines and all other flights were fine except for the Tui one. ""The flight was poorly managed by Tui,"" he said. ""Tui did announce that it was a requirement that the masks where kept on. It was said about four times. ""We made cabin crew aware that people were constantly removing their mask. No cabin crew approached those people. I've not experienced that from any flight I have had elsewhere."" He said people responded to requests from staff to make it known if they thought they had symptoms - and those were moved to the front where the curtain was closed. ""There were used wipes in my seat pocket when I got on, so the plane wasn't as clean as they said,"" he added. ""We should have been told to isolate before we got off the plane. We only found out from the news that this had happened. ""Five days later, I can't tell you how many people I have had contact with."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Travel expert Simon Calder said he was concerned about the length of time taken to contact people. ""It's absolutely imperative that people follow the rules,"" he said. ""By way of mitigation, speaking for cabin crew in general rather than for Tui who say they've got an investigation in place, it's very tough to police a late evening flight from a party island like Ibiza - or in this case Zante. ""They have to have regard for their own safety. Add to that there are legal exemptions for mask-wearing and it all becomes quite complicated. ""But what really worries me is the timing of all this. It's six days since that flight landed. ""We're supposed to fill in passenger locator forms with all our details and one would assume that as soon as any case is identified Public Health Wales would be on the case with everybody rather than leaving the best part of a week."" Tui said in a statement on Monday: ""Passengers are informed prior to travel and via PA announcements on the flight that they have to wear masks throughout and are not allowed to move around the cabin. ""Masks can only be removed when consuming food and drink."" Dr Shankar, PHW's Covid-19 incident director, told BBC Breakfast that public health officials initially identified seven people who had tested positive and were potentially infectious on the flight. He said since they began alerting passengers, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 16, but it was unclear where they had contracted the virus. He said that any of the 187 passengers and six crew on board the three-and-a-half hour flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport on Tuesday that had symptoms ""should book a test without delay"". It comes as agroup of people from Plymouth tested positive for the virusafter returning from Zante last Monday. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? There were1,715 new coronavirus cases - and one death - reported in the UKon Sunday - the highest number of daily infections recorded since 4 June. Cardiff Airport, which is owned by the Welsh Government, said it was working closely with airlines to ""facilitate passenger travel throughout this challenging time for the industry"". Can I still go on holiday to Turkey or Greece? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? ""Tui is taking every necessary measure following today's report,"" said Spencer Birns, Cardiff Airport's interim chief executive.

"Delay next year's GCSE and A-level exams - LabourExams due in May in England should be pushed back as late as July for more catch-up teaching, the party says.UK Politics","Next year's A-level and GCSE exams in England should be pushed back to mid-summer to help cope with the impact of coronavirus, Labour has said. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said students starting Year 11 and 13 in September had ""a mountain to climb"", having missed months of schooling. Exams scheduled for May should happen as late as July to allow more catch-up teaching time, she added. The government said it would ""consider"" its approach but exams would go ahead. Williamson urges parents to send pupils to school Heads reassure pupils: 'We are ready for you' Exams chaos 'must never happen again' Chaos dogged the exams system this year, leaving teachers, parents and pupils callingfor a major re-think of next summer's exams. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded to studentswere below teachers' predictions,with disadvantaged students particularly badly affected. Days after results were announced, and following widespread criticism, the government performed a U-turn and decided tobase grades on teachers' estimatesinstead. But many pupils were left in limbo, having already missed out on university places for this year's intake. GCSEs and A-level exams are expected to take place as normal next year, but Ms Green said: ""It's so important that the government starts to make contingency plans now so we don't see a repeat of the fiasco that we saw over the last few weeks."" She said students heading into year 11 and year 13 - the GCSE and A-level exam years - had seen ""a lot of disruption to their education"" and ""our first priority must be to give the students every possible chance to demonstrate their learning, their attainment and their potential"". ""Young people have never been front of mind when the government has been managing its way, or failing to manage its way, through this Covid crisis,"" Ms Green told BBC Breakfast. It would be ""unthinkable"" for exams to stay the same, said year 11 student Hemlata Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said Labour's plan was ""worthy of serious consideration"". But he added: ""A delay is not without its problems. A consequential delay to the publication of results will put pressure on higher education providers such as universities and colleges, as well as employers."" Year 11 student Hemlata told the BBC that ""the 2021 exams staying the same is unthinkable"". But Amber, who is in year 13, said that the delay could be a ""false hope"" unless there were clear plans to provide results and confirm university admissions in time. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of the university admissions body Ucas, said a delay to exams would create ""massive ripples of impact"" on entrance to university, sixth form or progression to apprenticeships. She said markers already had to read five million GCSE scripts and two million A-level papers on a tight schedule, making it hard to shorten the marking period. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons Education Select Committee, said there was only a ""50:50"" chance of A-level and GCSE exams taking place at all next summer, despite the government's promise.

Calls for a delay to exams come as millions of children are due to return to the classroom in England and Wales this week. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland have already reopened. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Getting all children back into their classrooms full-time in September is a national priority, as they are the best place for their education, development and wellbeing. ""We recognise that students due to take exams next summer will have experienced disruption to their education, which is why we prioritised bringing Year 10 and Year 12 pupils back to school last term. ""Exams will go ahead next year, and we have been working closely with the sector, Ofqual and exam boards to consider our approach."" Head teachers have saidthey are ready to welcome pupils back to school full-time, with a range of measures being put in place, such as staggered breaks and increased cleaning. But school leaders have warned that their budgets have been stretched by the pandemic to such an extent that they are having to weigh up pupil safety against their finances,the Guardian reports,external. Additional cleaning, personal protective equipment, the installation of hand washing stations and signs, plus the purchasing of laptops for remote working are among the Covid-related expenses incurred by schools, head teachers and unions told the paper. Meanwhile, a poll of nearly 6,000 school staff in England has found that 86% believe maintaining a social distance from both pupils and staff will not be possible. The survey by Tes found that 66% feared guidance to avoid busy corridors, entrances and exits was unrealistic.

"Arrest after woman stabbed in front of son, aged 5","The attack happened on Rudheath Avenue, Withington A woman has been stabbed in a ""vicious and unprovoked attack"" while walking with her five-year-old son. Greater Manchester Police said the 24-year-old was approached by a man with a knife in Rudheath Avenue, Withington at about 13:30 BST on Saturday. She suffered wounds to her leg in the attack and was taken to hospital where she is in a stable condition. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is being questioned by detectives. The woman's child was assessed at the scene by the emergency services and had no visible injuries. Police earlier issued images of a man they wanted to question about the attack, who was last seen making off on foot on to Bromborough Avenue and then continuing in the direction of Whitchurch Road. Det Insp John Robb said: ""This was a vicious attack in which a woman was stabbed in front of her young son. ""Our thoughts are with her and her family as she recovers from this shocking ordeal.

LiveLiveUS Covid-19 cases near six million7 minutes ago,"The US has now recorded six million cases of coronavirus, nearly a quarter of the world's total, Johns Hopkins University says Number of confirmed UK cases rises by 1,406 - down from Sunday's figure of 1,715 new cases; two more deaths are recorded India's economy shrank by 23.9% in the quarter ending in June, following a strict lockdown Labour calls for next year's GCSE and A Level exams in England to be delayed to make up for missed teaching The UK government's month-long Eat Out to Help Out scheme to boost restaurant trade ends tonight Global cases of coronavirus have surpassed 25 million with more than 846,000 deaths Edited by Lauren Turner Today's coverage was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Lauren Turner and Flora Drury, and written by Joshua Cheetham, Victoria Lindrea, Joshua Nevett and Georgina Rannard. We're pausing our live coverage for now - we hope you've enjoyed reading. The main coronavirus stories on Monday are: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the emergency authorisation of vaccines requires a âgreat deal of seriousness and reflectionâ. The UN body's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told reporters that every country had the right to approve drugs without full trial, but it was ânot something that you do lightlyâ. Thirty three vaccine candidates are currently up for clinical trials,according to the WHO,external, and a further 143 are in pre-clinical evaluation. Spain has reported more than 23,000 new coronavirus cases since Friday - suggesting the national infection rate has dropped slightly from a peak reached in the previous week. The country's cumulative total now stands at 462,858 - among some of the highest numbers in the world. Five deaths have also been reported since yesterday, bringing the national tally to 29,094. Health authorities said the latest figures could be modified in the future as Spain retroactively adjusts its daily data. Read more about why Spain is witnessing a second wave of the virus. We've also been reporting onan illegal event in Norway. Norwegian police have charged two people with breaking into an underground bunker in Oslo and using it to host a party on Saturday where several people suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. The so-called ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a police patrol met a group of confused young people. Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. Twenty seven people are being treated in hospital for inhaling carbon monoxide - six of them are in serious condition, and three are in intensive care. Police said the gas was being emitted from a generator which was being used to power the party's music systems. The bunker had only one entrance during the party, raising concerns that there could have been many fatalities. âJust think how 200 people would have  needed to evacuate through that in case of fire,â Lars Magne Hovtun of the Oslo fire brigade told NRK. âIt would have been an even bigger catastrophe, with dozens, if not hundreds dead.â Police had been tipped off about the party, which broke national measures aimed at stop the spread of coronavirus. But on Monday police said they'd lacked capacity to check on it. Arrests were also made for public order offences and driving under the influence of drugs Eight people have been fined up to Â£10,000, following an illegal rave in Wales which attracted 3,000 people. It follows new legislation introduced by the Welsh Governmentlast week to stop gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Theunlicensed event at Banwen, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, started on Saturday night - but there were still 400 people at the site on Monday morning. Police described organisers as ""really irresponsible"". Niamh, a student from Cardiff who attended, admitted she was surprised by the scale of the event - likening it to a festival. But she said the words ""illegal rave"" conjured images of ""a bunch of crazy people breaking the rules"", when, in reality, ""it was a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone was being as safe as they possibly could"". Read more.  Pupils should not be sent home if they refuse to comply with new guidance making face coverings mandatory in Scotland's secondary schools, Education Secretary John Swinney has said. New rules came into force on Monday, obliging all high school pupils to wear face coverings when moving about within Scotland's secondary schools. The rules will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils and primary pupils aged over five. But Mr Swinney rejected the idea that pupils should be sent home if they fail to wear a face mask. He said pupils should be ""encouraged and motivated and required"" to wear a face covering, which should be viewed as ""a habitual part of school life"". ""But it should not result in exclusion from school if they don't,"" he stressed. Exclusion had been mooted by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) at the government's coronavirus briefing on Monday. Mr Swinney said face coverings were worn ""to protect all of the school population - staff and pupils alike"". Several Swedish drug stores have reported a spike in demand for face masks, Reuters news agency reports, as authorities consider a change in policy on face coverings. Unlike most other countries in Europe, Sweden hasn't recommended the use of masks, and has kept many businesses and schools open. But Swedes have reportedly been stockpiling for the last two weeks, after the country's public health agency said it may issue new recommendations. Online pharmacist Apotea said that, during the last few weeks, online sales of face masks have nearly tripled to around 400,000 a week, according to Reuters. Drug store Apoteket has also seen a 30% rise in recent weeks. Par Svardson, Apotea's chief executive, told Reuters he expects a five to 10-fold increase in face mask sales, should government recommendations change. Sweden's death toll relative to its population has been high compared with some European neighbours. But the figure is still lower than other countries like the UK and Spain which have adopted strict lockdowns. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Parliament returns on Tuesday Conservative MPs in the UK are expecting a fractious atmosphere when they return to parliament on Tuesday, following the summer recess. When coronavirus hit, many of the government's plans went out the window. Ministers were forced to react quickly to unprecedented challenges. But the government has changed its mind a lot - and very publicly - in the last few months. To name a few: the NHS health surcharge, the NHS bereavement scheme, the rollout of the ""critical"" track and trace app, getting all primary pupils back in school before the summer, free school meals during the summer, the results algorithm, face coverings in schools. And there have been big changes in policy when it came to quarantine on arrival in the UK, which frustrated MPs too. There is growing disquiet in the Conservative Party that the government is on the back foot and that policies keep ""evolving"". U-turns are not always viewed as a bad thing - demonstrating, as they sometimes do, a government that is willing to listen. The danger for the government is that the public loses faith that ministers are in control - and loses faith in their decisions. With a new poll indicating that Labour has drawn level with the Tories, it suggests Boris Johnsonmay have his work cut out for him. Read more from Nick. A survey by Dalhousie University in Canada has found that support for stronger regulations on the use of plastic packaging has fallen during the coronavirus pandemic. Comparing survey results from a similar study conducted last year, researchers found support for a ban on plastics is down 12 percentage points to 58%, while the number of people wanting stronger regulations has fallen 11 percentage points to 79%. Support has also diverged among men and women - with support for bans and regulations dropping sharply among men. Over half of respondents also agreed that new laws on plastics should be delayed until after the pandemic is over. The study's authors say concerns about food safety are a major factor behind the change in tone. âCovid-19 may have made some people forget about our plastic addiction, but the problem is still amongst us.â, said Dr. Tony Walker, a co-author of the study. The conclusions are based on a survey 977 Canadians interviewed in July this year, and compared with answers from 1014 Canadians gathered in May 2019. The latest government figures,externalshow that there have been 1,406 positive cases of coronavirus reported in the UK over the past 24 hours - a drop of nearly 300 cases on the previous day's figures. Sunday saw the number of daily recorded cases reach 1,715 - the highest since early June. There were a further two deaths with coronavirus recorded on Monday. Sunday saw just one death recorded in the previous 24 hours. Figures for Mondays tend to be lower however, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Experts have suggested the rising case numbers, which have been climbing in the UK since July, may be the result of an increase in testing over recent weeks - meaning more people with the virus are being detected. The mayor of Philadelphia has been criticised for dining at an indoor restaurant in the neighbouring state of Maryland - despite introducing an indoor dining ban in his own city. A picture of Mayor Jim Kenney has gone viral, sparking accusations of hypocrisy by Philadelphia restauranteurs like Marc Vetri. Vetri has been railing against the closure of indoor dining.

In a statement, Mayor Kenney's office defended his decision, saying he had been ""[patronising] a restaurant owned by a friend of his"". ""Of course we understand the frustrations of local restaurant owners who have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic,"" it added. ""But there are 782 total cases in the county the mayor briefly visited, compared to over 33,000 cases in Philadelphia. Drastically different circumstances.â This video can not be played Coronavirus in Scotland: No 'one-size-fits-all approach' for local lockdowns The steps taken to try to suppress future local coronavirus outbreaks in Scotland will not necessarily follow the approach taken in Aberdeen, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Pubs and restaurants were shut for a period in the city during August after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to nightlife. According to Scotland's first minister, the management of future clusters would depend on the cause and potential spread. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed concern after 160 people tested positive for coronavirus in the past 24 hours - the biggest daily rise since mid-May. A total of 69 of the new cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with Sturgeon saying ""particularly close attention"" was being paid to this. Another 27 cases were reported in Lanarkshire, 18 in Lothian, and eight in Ayrshire and Arran. However, there were just four new cases in the Grampian area, suggesting the surge in Aberdeen - which led to a local lockdown - has been contained. The number of new daily cases in Scotland has slowed drastically since the peak of the outbreak in April, but local clusters have been occurring since the end of July.

As Europe continues to grapple with infection rates, here are some of the biggest updates from the continent's Nordic region: Far-right activists marched against coronavirus restrictions on Saturday German politicians have expressed anger at far-right
activists who overpowered police at the entrance to parliament â the Reichstag â
in Berlin on Saturday. The activists, some waving old imperial flags as symbols of
the far right, were part of a bigger demonstration against coronavirus
restrictions in Germany. Police reinforcementsdispersed the crowd on the steps ofthe Reichstag, using pepper spray, before they could storm the building. Several politicians called the incident âshamefulâ, among them
Chancellor Angela Merkelâs spokesman Steffen Seibert. Centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Lars Klingbeil called
the protestersâ action âan attack on our democracyâ. The Berlin police chief in charge on Saturday, Stephan
Katte, said the 250 police deployed around the Reichstag were enough, Berlin broadcaster
rbb24 reported. But the crowd of several hundred had shoved police aside at the bottom of the steps,
and there were only three police at the top, he said.

The rules will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils, as well as for primary pupils aged over five. Pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms, but where adults cannot keep a two-metre distance and are interacting face-to-face for more than 15 minutes, face coverings should be worn.

Typically held over the August bank holiday weekend, this year's noisy, flamboyant parades are off the agenda, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, organisers are streaming acts to give people the carnival experience in their own homes. But the streets of west London were not without the odd glimpse of carnival colour.

But there were key differences: the ceremony, which was dedicated to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, was filmed at several outdoor New York locations with a limited audience. And among the awards given was one for the best quarantine performance, highlighting artists who used their creativity to remain connected with their fans during lockdown.

"Trump and Biden trade blame over Portland unrestA man was shot dead in the city on Saturday, which has seen weeks of demonstrations.","This video can not be played The scene following the shooting of Aaron Danielson in Portland on 29 August President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden have been accusing one another over violence that has erupted at protests in Portland, Oregon. A man linked to a right-wing group was killed on Saturday, as elsewhere in the city a pro-Trump rally clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Trump called participants of the rally ""great patriots"" and blamed the city's Democratic mayor for the unrest. Mr Biden in turn accused Mr Trump of ""rooting for chaos and violence"". In a campaign speech in the city of Pittsburgh on Monday, the Democratic candidate said: ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames. But we must not burn. We have to build."" Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? Portland has become a flashpoint for demonstrations against police brutality and racism since the police killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May triggered a wave of national and international outrage. Media reports say a man who calls himself an anti-fascist is being investigated over Saturday's deadly shooting, while the founder of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer identified the victim as a supporter. Mr Trump on Sunday re-tweeted what appeared to be the dead man's name along with the message ""Rest in Peace"". Police have not publicly named the suspect or the victim, or specified whether the shooting was directly linked to the clashes. The president is set to visit the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday amid anger there over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake. Mr Trump has blamed Portland's Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler for the unrest. ""Portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor,"" he wrote on Twitter on Sunday as he suggested sending federal forces to the city. He also accused Mr Biden of being ""unwilling to lead"".

Mr Trump continued on Monday, describing Portland as ""a mess"" and repeating calls for ""LAW & ORDER."" ""If this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up, we will go in and do it for them,"" he wrote. In another tweet he said ""Radical Left Mayors & Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their 'Movement'."" ""It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists & Agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement,"" he added in reference to his Democratic rival. On Sunday Mr Biden said the president ""may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong - but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is"". Mr Biden travelled to Pittsburgh for a campaign speech on Monday He continued the argument in his speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, where he said Mr Trump had ""fomented"" violence in US cities. He called Mr Trump ""a bystander in his own presidency"" and ""an incumbent president who makes things worse not better"". ""Donald Trump has been a toxic presence on our nation for four years,"" Mr Biden said. ""Poisoning how we talk to one another. Poisoning the way we treat one another. Poisoning the values this nation has always held dear. Poisoning our very democracy. ""Will we rid ourselves of this toxin or make it a permanent part of this nation's character?"" Mayor Wheeler has also hit back at Mr Trump's criticism, saying the US president had ""created the hate and the division"". ""I'd appreciate it if the president would support us or stay the hell out of the way,"" he added. Law and order is a major theme of President Trump's bid for re-election, as he seeks to paint the Democrats and their candidate as soft on crime. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of trying to stoke tensions for political gain. Unrest broke out in Portland on Saturday night as a caravan of hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Portland police said they ""heard sounds of gunfire"" and ""located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest."" Right-wing group Patriot Prayer identified the victim as Aaron ""Jay"" Danielson, adding that he was ""a good friend and a supporter"". The group has held pro-Trump rallies in Portland and other US cities since 2016, according to the Associated Press news agency. Mr Trump also shared a tweet naming the victim as Jay Bishop - another name said to have been used by the same man - along with the message ""Rest in peace Jay!""

Love Island stars paid to promote Test and Trace,"Former Love Island contestant Shaughna Phillips is one Instagram influencer who has been promoting the NHS Test and Trace scheme to her followers The government paid social media influencers to promote the NHS Test and Trace service, it has confirmed. Instagram influencers, including Love Island stars, were paid an undisclosed amount to make posts during lockdown. The social media posts were part of a wider campaign to inform the public about the programme. ""Our use of social media influencers has meant over 7 million people have been reached,"" said a spokesman for the government. ""As a responsible government, we will use every means possible to keep the public informed during the pandemic and raise awareness of NHS Test and Trace.

Ms Phillips, who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, posted on 17 August, saying that she wanted to remind her audience ""about the importance of coronavirus testing"". She stressed that being tested was ""totally free, quick and is vital to stop the spread of coronavirus"". She went on to say that she had visited a drive-through testing centre herself and that she had received her test results within 24 hours. The Instagram posts by Mr Hughes, who has 2.1 million followers, and Mr Denzel, who has 1.2 million followers, both follow a similar format. In each post, the stars reference activities such as going out clubbing or enjoying time at a resort, emphasising that the public needs to ""do its part"" in getting things back to normal. According to social insights firm Captiv8, influencers with over a million followers on Instagram can earn up to $20,000 (Â£14,980) per post they make on behalf of advertisers. Latest figures published by the government for the week ending 19 August show that the NHS Test and Trace programme is now able to trace 75.5% of close contacts in England - below the government's target of isolating 80% of contacts in coronavirus cases within 72 hours. Figures for England show 80% of people who test positive are reached by test and trace teams. Of that number, about 80% provide contacts. And of those contacts, roughly two-thirds will be reached.

We're pausing our live coverage for now - we hope you've enjoyed reading. The main coronavirus stories on Monday are: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the emergency authorisation of vaccines requires a âgreat deal of seriousness and reflectionâ. The UN body's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told reporters that every country had the right to approve drugs without full trial, but it was ânot something that you do lightlyâ. Thirty three vaccine candidates are currently up for clinical trials,according to the WHO,external, and a further 143 are in pre-clinical evaluation. Spain has reported more than 23,000 new coronavirus cases since Friday - suggesting the national infection rate has dropped slightly from a peak reached in the previous week. The country's cumulative total now stands at 462,858 - among some of the highest numbers in the world. Five deaths have also been reported since yesterday, bringing the national tally to 29,094. Health authorities said the latest figures could be modified in the future as Spain retroactively adjusts its daily data. Read more about why Spain is witnessing a second wave of the virus. We've also been reporting onan illegal event in Norway. Norwegian police have charged two people with breaking into an underground bunker in Oslo and using it to host a party on Saturday where several people suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. The so-called ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a police patrol met a group of confused young people. Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. Twenty seven people are being treated in hospital for inhaling carbon monoxide - six of them are in serious condition, and three are in intensive care. Police said the gas was being emitted from a generator which was being used to power the party's music systems. The bunker had only one entrance during the party, raising concerns that there could have been many fatalities. âJust think how 200 people would have  needed to evacuate through that in case of fire,â Lars Magne Hovtun of the Oslo fire brigade told NRK. âIt would have been an even bigger catastrophe, with dozens, if not hundreds dead.â Police had been tipped off about the party, which broke national measures aimed at stop the spread of coronavirus. But on Monday police said they'd lacked capacity to check on it. Arrests were also made for public order offences and driving under the influence of drugs Eight people have been fined up to Â£10,000, following an illegal rave in Wales which attracted 3,000 people. It follows new legislation introduced by the Welsh Governmentlast week to stop gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Theunlicensed event at Banwen, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, started on Saturday night - but there were still 400 people at the site on Monday morning. Police described organisers as ""really irresponsible"". Niamh, a student from Cardiff who attended, admitted she was surprised by the scale of the event - likening it to a festival. But she said the words ""illegal rave"" conjured images of ""a bunch of crazy people breaking the rules"", when, in reality, ""it was a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone was being as safe as they possibly could"".

New rules came into force on Monday, obliging all high school pupils to wear face coverings when moving about within Scotland's secondary schools. The rules will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils and primary pupils aged over five. But Mr Swinney rejected the idea that pupils should be sent home if they fail to wear a face mask. He said pupils should be ""encouraged and motivated and required"" to wear a face covering, which should be viewed as ""a habitual part of school life"". ""But it should not result in exclusion from school if they don't,"" he stressed. Exclusion had been mooted by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) at the government's coronavirus briefing on Monday. Mr Swinney said face coverings were worn ""to protect all of the school population - staff and pupils alike"". Several Swedish drug stores have reported a spike in demand for face masks, Reuters news agency reports, as authorities consider a change in policy on face coverings. Unlike most other countries in Europe, Sweden hasn't recommended the use of masks, and has kept many businesses and schools open. But Swedes have reportedly been stockpiling for the last two weeks, after the country's public health agency said it may issue new recommendations. Online pharmacist Apotea said that, during the last few weeks, online sales of face masks have nearly tripled to around 400,000 a week, according to Reuters. Drug store Apoteket has also seen a 30% rise in recent weeks. Par Svardson, Apotea's chief executive, told Reuters he expects a five to 10-fold increase in face mask sales, should government recommendations change. Sweden's death toll relative to its population has been high compared with some European neighbours. But the figure is still lower than other countries like the UK and Spain which have adopted strict lockdowns. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Parliament returns on Tuesday Conservative MPs in the UK are expecting a fractious atmosphere when they return to parliament on Tuesday, following the summer recess. When coronavirus hit, many of the government's plans went out the window. Ministers were forced to react quickly to unprecedented challenges. But the government has changed its mind a lot - and very publicly - in the last few months. To name a few: the NHS health surcharge, the NHS bereavement scheme, the rollout of the ""critical"" track and trace app, getting all primary pupils back in school before the summer, free school meals during the summer, the results algorithm, face coverings in schools. And there have been big changes in policy when it came to quarantine on arrival in the UK, which frustrated MPs too. There is growing disquiet in the Conservative Party that the government is on the back foot and that policies keep ""evolving"". U-turns are not always viewed as a bad thing - demonstrating, as they sometimes do, a government that is willing to listen. The danger for the government is that the public loses faith that ministers are in control - and loses faith in their decisions. With a new poll indicating that Labour has drawn level with the Tories, it suggests Boris Johnsonmay have his work cut out for him. Read more from Nick. A survey by Dalhousie University in Canada has found that support for stronger regulations on the use of plastic packaging has fallen during the coronavirus pandemic. Comparing survey results from a similar study conducted last year, researchers found support for a ban on plastics is down 12 percentage points to 58%, while the number of people wanting stronger regulations has fallen 11 percentage points to 79%. Support has also diverged among men and women - with support for bans and regulations dropping sharply among men. Over half of respondents also agreed that new laws on plastics should be delayed until after the pandemic is over. The study's authors say concerns about food safety are a major factor behind the change in tone. âCovid-19 may have made some people forget about our plastic addiction, but the problem is still amongst us.â, said Dr. Tony Walker, a co-author of the study. The conclusions are based on a survey 977 Canadians interviewed in July this year, and compared with answers from 1014 Canadians gathered in May 2019. The latest government figures,externalshow that there have been 1,406 positive cases of coronavirus reported in the UK over the past 24 hours - a drop of nearly 300 cases on the previous day's figures. Sunday saw the number of daily recorded cases reach 1,715 - the highest since early June. There were a further two deaths with coronavirus recorded on Monday. Sunday saw just one death recorded in the previous 24 hours. Figures for Mondays tend to be lower however, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. Experts have suggested the rising case numbers, which have been climbing in the UK since July, may be the result of an increase in testing over recent weeks - meaning more people with the virus are being detected. The mayor of Philadelphia has been criticised for dining at an indoor restaurant in the neighbouring state of Maryland - despite introducing an indoor dining ban in his own city. A picture of Mayor Jim Kenney has gone viral, sparking accusations of hypocrisy by Philadelphia restauranteurs like Marc Vetri. Vetri has been railing against the closure of indoor dining.

In a statement, Mayor Kenney's office defended his decision, saying he had been ""[patronising] a restaurant owned by a friend of his"". ""Of course we understand the frustrations of local restaurant owners who have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic,"" it added. ""But there are 782 total cases in the county the mayor briefly visited, compared to over 33,000 cases in Philadelphia. Drastically different circumstances.â This video can not be played Coronavirus in Scotland: No 'one-size-fits-all approach' for local lockdowns The steps taken to try to suppress future local coronavirus outbreaks in Scotland will not necessarily follow the approach taken in Aberdeen, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Pubs and restaurants were shut for a period in the city during August after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to nightlife. According to Scotland's first minister, the management of future clusters would depend on the cause and potential spread. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed concern after 160 people tested positive for coronavirus in the past 24 hours - the biggest daily rise since mid-May. A total of 69 of the new cases were reported in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with Sturgeon saying ""particularly close attention"" was being paid to this. Another 27 cases were reported in Lanarkshire, 18 in Lothian, and eight in Ayrshire and Arran. However, there were just four new cases in the Grampian area, suggesting the surge in Aberdeen - which led to a local lockdown - has been contained. The number of new daily cases in Scotland has slowed drastically since the peak of the outbreak in April, but local clusters have been occurring since the end of July.

As Europe continues to grapple with infection rates, here are some of the biggest updates from the continent's Nordic region: Far-right activists marched against coronavirus restrictions on Saturday German politicians have expressed anger at far-right
activists who overpowered police at the entrance to parliament â the Reichstag â
in Berlin on Saturday. The activists, some waving old imperial flags as symbols of
the far right, were part of a bigger demonstration against coronavirus
restrictions in Germany. Police reinforcementsdispersed the crowd on the steps ofthe Reichstag, using pepper spray, before they could storm the building. Several politicians called the incident âshamefulâ, among them
Chancellor Angela Merkelâs spokesman Steffen Seibert. Centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Lars Klingbeil called
the protestersâ action âan attack on our democracyâ. The Berlin police chief in charge on Saturday, Stephan
Katte, said the 250 police deployed around the Reichstag were enough, Berlin broadcaster
rbb24 reported. But the crowd of several hundred had shoved police aside at the bottom of the steps,
and there were only three police at the top, he said. Students at St Columba's High School on Monday Pupils and staff in Scotland now have to wear face coverings when moving between classrooms in secondary schools, after new rules came into force today. The rules will also apply on school transport for all secondary pupils, as well as for primary pupils aged over five. Pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms, but where adults cannot keep a two-metre distance and are interacting face-to-face for more than 15 minutes, face coverings should be worn. ""We want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools,"" said Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney.

A performer heads to take part in the online show This year's Notting Hill Carnival - normally one of Britain's biggest and loudest cultural events - is being held virtually for the first time in its 54-year history. Typically held over the August bank holiday weekend, this year's noisy, flamboyant parades are off the agenda, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, organisers are streaming acts to give people the carnival experience in their own homes. But the streets of west London were not without the odd glimpse of carnival colour. A would-be carnival goer takes the opportunity to call for support for the NHS Djorn Fevrier, who has never missed a carnival, walks the route in Notting Hill Perhaps, at first glance, this year's MTV VMAs looked much like previous years: Lady Gaga took home five awards, while BTS and Ariana Grande scooped up four each and The Weeknd won video of the year. But there were key differences: the ceremony, which was dedicated to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, was filmed at several outdoor New York locations with a limited audience. And among the awards given was one for the best quarantine performance, highlighting artists who used their creativity to remain connected with their fans during lockdown. The prize went to Latino boy band CNCO - Unplugged At Home, who beat Chloe x Halle, DJ D-Nice, John Legend, Lady Gaga and Post Malone. Read about our seven key moments here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The year that changed EuropeMore than a million people arrived in Europe in 2015. Five years on, we reflect on what's changed.","Five years ago, more than one million people crossed into Europe. Many of them took huge risks and embarked on dangerous journeys in an effort to escape conflict and find a better life. But the sudden influx of people sparked a crisis - both humanitarian and political - as Europe struggled to respond. Thousands died attempting to reach its shores and, while some countries opened their arms, others erected fences and closed their borders. The impact of this mass migration is still being felt today. Here, BBC correspondents, experts and those who made the journey themselves reflect on that dramatic time. How did it change Europe and the lives of those involved? Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My life before the war in 2011 was very good. I was a maths teacher in Aleppo with two children. But as the war started, I knew we had no future in the country. I used to drive to work and see bodies on the side of the road. So I fled to Turkey - it was the easiest option back then. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:Syria's war shot Turkey to the front of the migration story. It borders Greece and Bulgaria, so in many ways it became the EU's waiting room. There was a huge flow of people from Syria to Turkey and then on to Greece in 2015. Julian Miglierini, BBC reporter in Rome:But in Italy, migration had been a big issue for years. Its closeness to North Africa made it a prime destination for those willing to risk crossing the Mediterranean, and many people did. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:That summer in Serbia it was common to see people on the streets who had travelled from the Middle East. They were taking the Balkan route - which wound north through Greece and North Macedonia on the path towards countries like Germany. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My two sisters already lived in Germany. I realised that Turkey was not the future I was looking for for me and my little kids, so I decided to travel there to find better opportunities. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany had been taking in people fleeing war and persecution and it had a reputation as a welcoming country. But when thousands of people arrived at the start of September 2015, a crowd was there to meet them with hand-painted signs and gifts for the exhausted people coming off the trains. They broke into spontaneous applause and cheering - it was an extraordinary moment. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:I arrived in Munich after a long and complicated journey. It was raining cats and dogs! For me that was the first strange thing I noticed... rain in the summer! But I met very nice people who were so open to the refugees. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Similarly, in Sweden, the mood at the time was that this was one of the most welcoming countries anywhere. At stations there were people with banners saying ""refugees welcome"", and a year earlier the prime minister had given a speech asking Swedes to open their hearts to migrants. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:At university they would always talk about how Sweden was welcoming to refugees, so I fled Jordan. I had no choice because my life was in danger. My sister was already in Sweden and we were eventually reunited. When I arrived I thought I was finally free. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:The big shift came when police in North Macedonia fired teargas at people trying to cross the border with Greece. The authorities said they were overwhelmed. It seemed like Europe had suddenly become keenly aware of a problem that had been hiding in plain sight. Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent:And in Hungary the government announced it would erect a fence on its border. Police also sealed off the main railway station in Budapest to stop people travelling further. But the measures just forced people into the hands of smugglers and illegality. Bethany Bell, Austria correspondent:The dead bodies of dozens of migrants were later discovered in the back of a lorry that had travelled from Hungary into Austria. It was a shocking moment that highlighted the issue of people smuggling and the desperation of those caught up in the crisis. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Angela Merkel, like all of us, was horrified by the lorry discovery. It seemed to have a profound impact on her. Just days later she said at least 800,000 people would likely seek asylum in Germany that year. And for the first time she used what would become her catchphrase: ""wir schaffen das"" - we will manage it. Men carry the coffin of a Kurdish man whose body was found in a lorry in Austria Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent:Merkel, in agreement with the Austrian chancellor, agreed to take in those who were left stuck in Hungary. Thousands gave up on Budapest station and marched to Vienna. Hungary's view was essentially: 'If you want these people, you can have them'. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:After I arrived in Munich, I went to two refugee camps before I was moved to a small town in Hessen. We met Germans who wanted to get in contact with refugees and help us integrate. They've been very supportive to me at every stage and I still live there now. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany's approach was to try to ensure that new arrivals were housed all over the country; that no one area should be disproportionately affected. In reality, it became the job of local mayors and authorities to sort the logistics. But they were supported by a remarkable volunteer movement. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Migrant families in Sweden often ended up in remote locations, or in temporary accommodation moving from place to place. And while openness to the new arrivals was the norm, that began to shift as the strain on resources became more apparent. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:Eventually, the Balkan Route was declared closed in March 2016. That helped to reduce the flow of people. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:And a deal struck between the EU and Turkey a few weeks later proved remarkably effective. It stated that Turkey would be given billions in EU aid for agreeing to take back Syrian refugees who arrived on Greek islands. It led to a massive decline in numbers. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:Sweden was very hard at first and people tried to take advantage of me before I was granted refugee status. I have legal status now, and I want to use my degree, but I've come to realise they don't accept foreign qualifications here. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:A lot of people thought Sweden would be paradise but the reality has delivered more challenges than they might have expected. Even highly educated migrants with great English have struggled to progress because their qualifications are invalid. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:I've applied for about 100 jobs and have never been invited to interview. So now I've decided to do what they want and I'm studying for a Swedish diploma. I want to build a future, I want to be independent, but it's been six years and I don't have anything. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Housing and employment have been two of the biggest issues. Sweden has a huge squeeze on accommodation in major cities. Unless you've been in a queue for social housing for years you're reliant on connections. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:One legacy of 2015 is the innovative ways people have addressed issues like housing. In Hamburg and Bremen they actually turned shipping containers into homes for migrants. In Amsterdam, they built a similar ""container city"" that housed 50% young Dutch people and 50% refugees. But there are still issues. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:The unemployment rate for foreign-born citizens is 21.2% vs. 5.5% for those born here. The aim is for new arrivals not to be doing black market jobs, and there has been a debate about whether there should be looser rules that would allow them to work more easily. Samar Jaber, Engineering graduate from Jordan:You cannot feel stable. It feels like every time I do something I get asked for another thing! Do you think I want to stay at home and not work? We all want to work. But there's nothing. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Germany has an ageing population and the new arrivals were seen by some as an answer to a shortage of skilled workers - big companies like Siemens started to offer apprenticeships. But inevitably there were problems and the migration issue dominated society for several years. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Crimes committed by asylum seekers dominated headlines. The attacks on young women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 at the hands of men who came - in the main - from North Africa fuelled anger as did the terror attack on a Berlin Christmas market, perpetrated by a Tunisian man who had come to Europe as an asylum seeker. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:Crime has become part of the immigration debate here, too. There have been high-profile incidents, but police will tell you that crime in certain high-immigration areas is largely not from recent arrivals but from criminal networks and gangs. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:There was a backlash against Merkel's ""we can manage"" policies, and she soon dropped the slogan as support for the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party grew. ""FlÃ¼chtlingspolitik"" (refugee politics) polarised society. Julian Miglierini, BBC reporter in Rome:In Italy, nationalists exploited a perceived lack of co-operation from the EU and fellow European countries during the crisis. They've expressed anti-migrant sentiments and the message has clicked with many Italians. Nationalists have certainly had electoral success here since. Daphne Halikiopoulou, professor of European politics:The trend we've seen in Europe, starting from the economic crisis and then continuing with the migrant crisis, is the shrinking of the mainstream and the rise of nationalist policies. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:The nationalist Sweden Democrats have got more attention here since the crisis and have gained in popularity. It's become more acceptable to voice anti-immigration views, and a cap on numbers has been introduced and even adopted as a policy by the centre-left. Bethany Bell, Austria correspondent:The crisis has brought about significant change in Austrian politics. Opposing immigration has been a huge theme for Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  His anti-migrant message helped him win two elections and take votes away from the far-right. It's still a dominant issue for his conservative party. Daphne Halikiopoulou, professor of European politics:The actual immigration numbers often don't correspond with people voting for a particular party. What's more important is how voters perceive the crisis and how it's portrayed. In this way, parties have been able to influence mainstream politics in a way that they weren't before. Guy De Launey, Balkans correspondent:Some nationalist politicians have attempted to use the crisis to stir up support. In general, sympathy for the plight of those coming up the Balkan Route appears to have declined. People are protesting against asylum centres and compassion fatigue has taken root. Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent: And in Hungary the conservative Fidesz government has used the crisis to bolster its own support. This, combined with an economic boom, made them unbeatable in 2018. Daphne Halikiopoulou, Professor of European politics:We can understand the impact of the migrant crisis mostly in terms of the opportunity it presented to [nationalist] parties to increase their support. And I think we'll continue to see these parties becoming more embedded in the political mainstream. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:In places like Sweden and Germany, which saw the largest number of arrivals, they were faced with a less orderly approach to addressing integration. But there was a huge, grassroots volunteering effort, which was one of the most positive things to come out of the situation. Maddy Savage, Sweden correspondent:But it's still difficult for immigrants to climb the ladder. Sooner rather than later we might see how things pan out for the children who came here and are approaching the age where they'll enter the job market. Jenny Phillimore, professor of migration:That will be the moment when Sweden knows whether its response has been a success or not. It has an ageing population, so to suddenly receive an injection of 40,000 young and able people could prove a major success. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:In Germany, schools recruited extra teachers and people from other professions were fast-tracked through training to boost numbers. Extra classes were set up for children who shared no common language. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:My daughter is doing very well at school here. We both speak German fluently and have a lot of friends. She's ambitious and I want her to do better than I have done. Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondent:Many of those who arrived have integrated, learned the language, and built new lives. It's by no means perfect and there are still plenty of problems but hundreds of thousands of people - Syrians, Iraqis, and many others - are putting down roots. Mark Lowen, Turkey correspondent 2014-19:It has really changed the fabric of Istanbul. Some streets there have exclusively Syrian shops, restaurants and cafes. And a lot of those Syrians actually want to stay in Turkey now because they're settled and it's a safe country. Samar Jaber, engineering graduate from Jordan:Sweden is a very generous country. It's changed me - I used to be afraid of many things but now I feel different. I'm preparing to study for a master's degree and I hope I'll be able to fulfil my dreams. Lara Tahan, Syrian teacher:I'm looking forward to getting my German passport. We decided to come here to have better lives and to live with dignity and security, and our life here is very good. Some names have been changed to protect identities. EU migration: Crisis in seven charts Â© 2025 BBC.

BLM - from Facebook post to global movement,"This video can not be played 'I feel like Black Lives Matter has become a trend' A slogan chanted by tens of thousands around the world, Black Lives Matter has sparked a hashtag, a network of grass-roots organisations, and a moral collective of activists. But how did it go from a social media post to a global phenomenon, and where does it go now? The names most associated with Black Lives Matter are not its leaders but the victims who have drawn attention to the massive issues of racism this country grapples with: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, to name a few. The movement can be traced back to 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in Florida. The 17-year-old had been returning from a shop after buying sweets and iced tea.  Mr Zimmerman claimed the unarmed black teenager had looked suspicious. There was outrage when he was found not guilty of murder, and a Facebook post entitled ""Black Lives Matter"" captured a mood and sparked action. An early Black Lives Matter demonstration in Beverly Hills following the acquittal of Goerge Zimmerman for the murder of Trayvon Martin ""Seven years ago, we were called together. There were about 30 of us standing in the courtyard of this black artist community in Los Angeles, summoned by Patrisse Cullors, one of our co-founders and one of my dearest friends,"" says Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan African Studies in Los Angeles and co-founder of one of Black Lives Matters first ""chapters"". ""It was students â¦ artists, organisers and mommas. We knew that it was part of our sacred duty to step up. And there was an audaciousness that we could transform the world, but we didn't have a plan for it,"" she laughs. If calls for justice for Trayvon Martin lit the spark for Black Lives Matter, it was the death of Michael Brown a year later that really brought the movement to national attention. The unarmed teenager had been shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri and Black Lives Matter took to the streets, often in angry confrontation with the police. But the killing of George Floyd took the movement to areas it had not reached before. This moment of national reckoning gives Ambassador Andrew Young, a legendary civil rights leader, a ""tremendous sense of pride"". ""Especially that they have remained overwhelmingly nonviolent,"" the 88-year-old says. For years he marched shoulder-to-shoulder with Rev Martin Luther King Jr, but very much as a civil rights leader in his own right. He was later awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom and served as US Ambassador to the United Nations. ""Of course it was very different back then. We had to go door-to-door, church-to-church,"" he says. ""When Dr King went to jail, only 55 people showed up,"" Ambassador Young remembers. Ambassador Andrew Young, seated to the right of Martin Luther King Jr with other civil rights leaders In the 1960s, many of the key American civil rights figures were known the world over, but even someone as connected to the struggle for equality as Ambassador Young finds it hard to name contemporaries in the modern movement. ""Honestly, I don't know who Black Lives Matter is,"" he acknowledges. ""I don't know who the leaders are. In fact, I don't know that they even have any leaders.  I think perhaps it's a spiritual, emotional movement created by implicit evils in our society that we have not been willing to face."" Those who have been involved with Black Lives Matter since its embryonic stages say this decentralized approach is intentional. ""Group-centred leadership is in our guiding principles,"" says Prof Abdullah. ""Leadership is not just about oratory, it's also about facilitation, planning, bringing arts to the movement, things that don't get as much recognition,"" she says. The leadership in many Black Lives Matter chapters is also often female. ""Black women have always been at the heart of the black freedom struggle. Often times they have been painted over, and this time we are refusing to allow ourselves to be painted over,"" says Prof Abdullah. The guiding light for this doctrine, and for Black Lives Matter as a whole, she says, has been Ella Baker - the feminist civil rights leader who championed collective grassroots activism over activism focused on a single leader. ""We all study Ella Baker as one of the most brilliant organisers to have ever walked the face of this earth. She was clear that movements should be bigger than individuals."" What black radio makes of this moment How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Though Black Lives Matter has evolved into this loose national and international umbrella network, the Black Lives Matter Global Network is registered in the US as a non-profit organisation, one that is now getting grants and pledges from foundations and corporations falling over themselves to ally themselves with the movement. Chapters of Black Lives Matter have spread across the US and around the globe, with massive protests in the UK, Europe, and Canada. The movement now includes many of diverse backgrounds, who had previously not felt connected to the cause. ""I think a lot of people in our town suddenly felt as white people we need to be really critical of ourselves and understand our role in this,"" says AJ Crocker, one of the organisers of a Black Lives Matter vigil in in Norwood, Colorado, a mostly white town of about 500 people located about six hours drive from the nearest international airport. Around 50 people attend the Black Lives Matter vigil in the predominantly white town of Norwood, Colorado Ms Crocker says the group is learning how they can combat racism in their own small community, such as campaigning for an official Spanish translator for the county. They will also bring up Black Lives Matter as a discussion topic in the town council and are reading Ibram X Kendi's book ""How to be an Antiracist"" in the local book club. ""I actually really do appreciate that people are starting to educate themselves. There's a lot of literature out there that's pushing to educate our white counterparts on the issues that affect us and that's good,"" says Charles White, a keyboard player with Day Dream Sessions. The band has been playing some of the songs that have become the soundtrack to the street demonstrations in Washington DC, including old protest anthems from Marvin Gaye and Sam Cooke. But Mr White and his bandmates are also sceptical about what they sees as the mainstreaming of the movement. ""I feel like Black Lives Matter has become a trend,"" says drummer and bandleader David Mooney. ""At first it was about changing the situation at hand, but now you have all these corporations saying they support black people but they're just hoping to gain more customers and more money."" (From left to right) Eric Jackson, David Mooney, Charles White perform as Day Dream Sessions during Black Lives Matter protests in Washington DC And though some Black Lives Matter leaders deny it, over the years there has sometimes been a disconnect between the organisation itself and young black men, a constituency they are fighting for, the band says. ""I think the initial inception of Black Lives Matter is what we believed in and what we were marching behind,"" says trumpeter Eric Jackson. ""It was really about police brutality and the effects of that on black people. But I think now it's a multilayered thing with feminism and LGBTQ and all these different things kind of coupled into it. I think there needs to be a little bit of refocusing."" ""But Black Lives Matter as a message is one I still stand behind,"" he insists. Why US protests are so powerful this time Black Lives Matter in rural England Young skater goes viral performing at Black Lives Matter Plaza Prof Abdullah though is proud of how the organisation has also been deliberately intersectional, with many women and LGBT activists at its heart. ""Black Lives Matter has been very clear that we are a womanist movement. And that doesn't mean that we exclude men, in fact there are lots of strong male leaders,"" she says. She says the organisation is also just as concerned about tangible change, and that results are already being seen, albeit limited. ""Over the past six years, overall the number of killings at the hands of police has remained relatively stable, and that is not a good thing,"" says Prof Abdullah. ""However, what we are seeing is that in cities with strong Black Lives Matter chapters, the numbers have dropped dramatically, though this has been offset by increases elsewhere."" She says the gains have been achieved not by negotiating with police forces, which the organisation refuses to do, but by taking to the streets and making sure the police know they are being scrutinised. Prof Abdullah says that Black Lives Matter is looking for much more, including the defunding and dismantling of the current police system in the US and its replacement with a new form of law enforcement, something for which it has received considerable criticism. Black Lives Matter protesters in London's Hyde Park But while she says the organisation advocates one way of putting pressure on those in power, she is also supportive of chapters going their own way. ""One of the things that's really great is that we see new Black Lives Matter chapters, popping up all over the globe. They may not be official chapters, but people are stepping into their own calling.""

Price of plastic carrier bags to double next year,"The fee for plastic shopping bags in England will be doubled to 10p and extended to all shops from April 2021. Small retailers - those employing 250 people or fewer - will no longer be exempt, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. Environment Secretary George Eustice described the UK as ""a world-leader in this global effort"". Greenpeace said the move was ""a small step in the right direction"" but urged the government to go further. The environmental group called for ""fast and substantial reductions on plastic pollution"" beyond the issue of carrier bags. Mr Eustice described the original 5p charge at large retailers as a ""tremendous success"" and said the increase to 10p should be seen alongside other measures such as the ban on plastic straws, drinks stirrers and cotton buds in England. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had somewhere between six and 10 bags for life at his home but did sometimes purchase carriers when he forgot them. The increase in charge for single-use bags will encourage the sale and use of bags for life, he added. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags. It was introduced first in Wales in 2011, then in Northern Ireland in 2013, before Scotland introduced the charge for all carrier bags in 2014, and England rolled out its plastic bag charge on 5 October 2015. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic A public consultation in England last year saw the ""vast majority"" of people back government plans to raise the fee, in a bid to further reduce the plastic used by consumers. Since the fee was introduced in England, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation, with studies demonstrating the levy has had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea. In 2014, 7.6 billion bags were given away to customers at England's seven largest supermarkets, the equivalent of 140 per member of the population. Between 2017 and 2018 just over a billion bags were sold at major supermarkets across the UK. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Smaller retailers in England supply about 3.6 billion single-use bags annually. Last December, the Association of Convenience Stores estimated about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags. The government ""expects"" retailers to donate proceeds from plastic bag sales to good causes - but it's not compulsory. According to Defra, an estimated Â£51m was donated in 2017-18. But while the vast majority of retailers chose to donate their plastic bag revenue - in line with government expectations - some chose to keep the money instead. Greenpeace welcomed the fee increase, but said plastic carriers bags were only ""one part of the problem"" and the government should be considering taking action on plastic bags-for-life. Greenpeace's Sam Chetan-Welsh said: ""By raising the price of plastic bags again the government is taking a small step in the right direction, but by now they should be taking great strides."" He added there were ""so many ways ministers know they could be driving fast and substantial reductions on plastic pollution"". ""If they're increasing costs for shoppers, ministers really have no excuse not to increase costs for the companies that are responsible for the escalating volumes of single-use plastic packaging in the first place."" Earlier this month, supermarketMorrisons initiated a trial offering paper bags instead of reusable plastic ones, with the aim of ditching all plastic bags from its stores. Responding to the forthcoming fee hike, CPRE - the countryside charity - said it was time to ""step up and face the war on plastic"". ""Government should bring in charges on all single-use, throwaway items - from takeaway cups to wooden forks,"" said Tom Fyans, deputy chief executive. ""Incentivising re-use systems and finally committing to an all-in Deposit Return Scheme for drinks containers are the only ways the government can achieve a litter-free countryside and win the war on waste.""

India sets new daily Covid case record,"Doctors say India has to do more to increase its testing India has set a record for the world's highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases. The nation, the world's third-most infected, on Sunday reported 78,761 new cases in 24 hours, passing the number posted in the US on 17 July. The rise comes as the government continues to lift restrictions to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. An upsurge of Covid-19 in many rural areas continues to be a major concern. On Sunday, global infections passed the 25 million mark, with 843,000 deaths. The US remains the most affected nation, closing in on six million infections,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. India's single-day tally on Sunday passed the one-day increase of 77,299 reported by the United States on 17 July. Cardiology doctor, Manoj Kumar, told Reuters: ""It is the largest one-day surge in cases worldwide and the reason behind this - because the pandemic is spreading in the rural areas."" How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing? In the initial stages of Covid-19, India appeared to be doing fairly well, imposing a strict lockdown, but the virus then hit megacities like Mumbai and Delhi, before surging in smaller cities and rural areas. Despite the increase, the government has pressed ahead with easing restrictions. Gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed at cultural, entertainment and sports events from next month, with face mask and social distancing measures. Underground train networks will also start to reopen in big cities. It is feared India's reporting of deaths has been far too low Dr Rajiv Parekh, chairman of the Medanta division of peripheral vascular and endovascular sciences, told Reuters: ""People thought that once the numbers started to go down, this was it, they had won the war.... everybody was out there without wearing a mask, without any social distancing. ""That is something that we should not have allowed to have happened."" Doctors also say under-reporting and limited testing remain major concerns. The figure of 63,000 deaths in India is roughly on a par with Mexico. But infections in the central American nation are only at 591,000, compared to India's 3.5 million. India's government collates the number of deaths from positive cases but not from suspected infections. On testing, virologist Shahid Jameel, who heads the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, told Agence France Presse: ""Testing per million in India at 30,000 remains the second lowest in top 10 [virus-infected] countries."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his monthly radio address without mentioning the latest milestone. He called on citizens to observe the rules and remain united to try to defeat coronavirus. ""It is important that every citizen is healthy and happy and we defeat coronavirus completely together,"" Mr Modi said. ""Corona can only be defeated when you remain safe, when you fulfil the resolve of keeping a safe distance of two metres and wearing masks.

Government paid influencers to promote Test and Trace,"Former Love Island contestant Shaughna Phillips is one Instagram influencer who has been promoting the NHS Test and Trace scheme to her followers The government paid social media influencers to promote the NHS Test and Trace service, it has confirmed. Instagram influencers, including Love Island stars, were paid an undisclosed amount to make posts during lockdown. The social media posts were part of a wider campaign to inform the public about the programme. ""Our use of social media influencers has meant over 7 million people have been reached,"" said a spokesman for the government. ""As a responsible government, we will use every means possible to keep the public informed during the pandemic and raise awareness of NHS Test and Trace. ""This is just one part of a wider campaign utilising TV, radio, social, print and other advertisements to ensure the public has the information it needs."" Health ministers hails 'successful' test and trace system Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number Coronavirus: England test and trace system identifies 31,000 contacts The government said that all costs involved in the campaign would be published in due course as part of the regular transparency reports on gov.uk. Dozens of Instagram influencers including former Love Island contestants Shaughna Phillips, Chris Hughes and Josh Denzel made paid Instagram posts marked as ads, with the hashtags ""#gettested"" and ""letsgetback"".

Ms Phillips, who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, posted on 17 August, saying that she wanted to remind her audience ""about the importance of coronavirus testing"". She stressed that being tested was ""totally free, quick and is vital to stop the spread of coronavirus"". She went on to say that she had visited a drive-through testing centre herself and that she had received her test results within 24 hours. The Instagram posts by Mr Hughes, who has 2.1 million followers, and Mr Denzel, who has 1.2 million followers, both follow a similar format. In each post, the stars reference activities such as going out clubbing or enjoying time at a resort, emphasising that the public needs to ""do its part"" in getting things back to normal. According to social insights firm Captiv8, influencers with over a million followers on Instagram can earn up to $20,000 (Â£14,980) per post they make on behalf of advertisers. Latest figures published by the government for the week ending 19 August show that the NHS Test and Trace programme is now able to trace 75.5% of close contacts in England - below the government's target of isolating 80% of contacts in coronavirus cases within 72 hours. Figures for England show 80% of people who test positive are reached by test and trace teams. Of that number, about 80% provide contacts. And of those contacts, roughly two-thirds will be reached.

Carbon monoxide poisons bunker partygoers,"Around 200 people are thought to have attended the rave Twenty-five people have been taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning after attending an illegal rave in a bunker in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. Five are in a critical condition and two police officers who tended to the partygoers are among those poisoned. Authorities believe the poisoning was caused by portable generators. Police say the ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a patrol met a group of confused young people. Country profile Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. It was not immediately known who had organised the underground event which was reportedly planned three weeks in advance and kept secret from the authorities. Oslo police say they are investigating why a tip-off about the rave was not acted upon. Emergency services found seven people unconscious in the bunker in the city's St Hanshaugen area. The lives of all of the victims, believed to be mainly aged between 20 and 30, are said to be out of danger but police have called for other attendees to seek medical attention if they start suffering from nausea, headaches or dizziness. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gasproduced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. The gas is harmful because it displaces oxygen from red blood cells, resulting in damage to major organs. One man who left before police arrived told public broadcaster NRK he had gone outside repeatedly for fresh air after arriving for the rave at 23:00 (21:00 GMT) on Saturday. ""When you rave in a room without windows with 50 to 60 others, the air becomes heavy,"" the unnamed man said. ""I had to go out several times and breathe fresh air."" The same man said other parties had been held in the same bunker this summer. Generators were being used to power lighting and sound systems, Norwegian media report. Vidar Haukeland, head ofthe company which owns the bunker, Stiftelsen Diakonissehuset Lovisenberg, described the rave as a ""serious break-in"",externaland said the company did not feel any responsibility, VG newspaper reports. Boards covering the entrance to the bunker had been removed, the paper says. Earlier this month, Norway banned the serving of alcohol in bars after midnight until further notice after a rise in coronavirus infections. The ban is due to be reviewed in September,external, Health Minister Bent HÃ¸ie told Aftenposten newspaper.

Stephanie Whitfield, from Cardiff, who was on the flight with her partner, told the BBC she was not surprised. She said she and her husband ""decided to isolate for two weeks on the flight"", before they even learnt about the positive cases. ""This flight was a debacle. The chap next to me had his mask around his neck. Not only did the airline not pull him up on it, they gave him a free drink when he said he knew a member of the crew. ""Loads of people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others. ""As soon as the flight landed, a load of people took their masks off immediately.

"Scottish gyms and swimming pools reopenAfter five months of lockdown, indoor sports and fitness can start up again under Covid restrictions.Scotland","This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish gyms and pools reopen Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts can now reopen in Scotland after the coronavirus lockdown. After almost 24 weeks, venues are able to open afterNicola Sturgeon brought the planned date for some indoor sports forwardby two weeks. It comes as the requirement for school pupils to wear face coverings also comes into effect. Secondary pupils will wear them between classes and all pupils will wear them on school transport. The reopening of indoor sports halls followsweeks of pressure from the fitness industryand sports governing bodies. They argued that strict safety measures would allow them to open safely. Why have Scotland's pubs opened before its gyms? Fear of 'long term damage' to Scottish gymnastics Rink closures threat to ice hockey club's future Over 12s can take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios. Younger children can do all activity. The gym and swimming pool at Inverness Leisure Centre opened at midnight. People were back in the gym in Inverness as soon as it opened Lee Crawford was one of the first in when the doors opened. ""I had nothing on tomorrow so thought I'd get a couple of hours tonight,"" he said. ""I haven't lifted heavy weights in a wee while, just been stuck in the garage with light weights. ""I thought it would be busier than this."" Social distancing measures have been put in place at the Inverness gym Swim coach Kirsty Ewan, who was back in the pool just after midnight, said: ""I was just a bit excited. I think it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. ""I spend a large proportion of my life here, coaching and swimming myself, so to be away for so long I just wanted to come back at the first opportunity. ""I've definitely missed being in the pool. I've done some open-water swimming in lochs but there's nothing quite like being in the pool with the smell of chlorine and things, so it's really nice to be back."" Gym owner Steven Morley opened the doors of his New Age Fitness gyms in Hamilton and Coatbridge at 06:00. He told the BBC his staff had been working non-stop to get safety measures in place. Steven said: ""It's been tough but we knew this was just temporary. To watch the members walk back through the doors will be absolutely amazing and will make all the hard work myself and the staff have put in the last few weeks worth it."" Gymnastics clubs were also waiting to welcome back their athletes. West Lothian Gym Club made videos to show its members its anti-virus measures West Lothian Gymnastics Club in Livingston was previously the only club in Scotland allowed to open as it welcomed just five high performance gymnasts but it was preparing to welcome its younger gymnasts on Monday. The club has shared videos showing the children how one-way systems and ""gym bubbles"" will work. Head women's coach Becki Campbell said: ""We have managed to prepare well in advance so we are ready. On Monday we welcome two recreational classes and five competitive groups. ""We have also been doing gymnast workshops on Zoom. We were worried some would not feel ready but they absolutely are."" The Gold Star cheerleaders know training will be very different now with restrictions in place Even dance schools have had to mark out the floor to keep children socially distanced Dance schools also have the go-ahead to open. Scotland's most successful cheerleading squad, Gold Star in Glasgow said it had made sure its studio was as safe as it could be. Owner Claire McCreath said: ""We have spent the whole week deep cleaning, then doing it again and again. We are relieved, excited and ready to roll and it will be the best feeling to see and hear the people in real life."" Many of Scotland's public and charitable trust-run pools and gyms are taking a slower approach. One issue is the viability of reopening if customer numbers are low and operational costs high. While High Life Highland, which operates sport and leisure facilities in the area, says all of its leisure facilities will reopen today, others have said some facilities will not reopen until October. Different arrangements are in place for each area. For example, although most of the facilities run by Live Argyll are reopening today, pre-booking will be required and limited to members only for the first four weeks. Pools will be open for lane swimming only and there will be a minimum age of eight. In the Borders, the trust that runs leisure facilities on behalf of the council has started a phased reopening of its facilities. Live Life Aberdeenshire is taking the same approach. But in Dumfries and Galloway, the council is working towards having its sites across the region - including the flagship DG1 centre - open by 14 September. In Angus, the seven Angus Live sport and leisure venues will not reopen until after 14 September. The operators say it is to allow for safety procedures to be put in place and for staff to be trained. No dates have been given for when pools in the area will reopen. Similarly in South Lanarkshire, fitness classes will not resume until 14 September and gyms will reopen the following week. Pools will not open until Monday 5 October. North Ayrshire Swimming Club will resume training in the water in two weeks. Swimmer Isla Waller has been training by Zoom for five months and only recently started land training and braving outdoor swimming. After missing her national championships she is ready to get back and more than willing to wait a little longer. Isla, like a lot of swimmers and athletes who train in local authority facilities, will have to wait a bit longer to get back The 13-year-old told the BBC: ""I was so excited when we heard the date. My mum texted me at school to tell me. ""It will be different when we get back to the pool but we will be fine. ""It will be good to see friends because we don't get to see everyone at land training."" More restrictions will be lifted on 14 September. Sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues will be able to reopen with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions.

"Arrest after woman stabbed in front of son, aged 5A teenager is held on suspicion of attempted murder following the ""vicious"" attack.Manchester","The attack happened on Rudheath Avenue, Withington A woman has been stabbed in a ""vicious and unprovoked attack"" while walking with her five-year-old son. Greater Manchester Police said the 24-year-old was approached by a man with a knife in Rudheath Avenue, Withington at about 13:30 BST on Saturday. She suffered wounds to her leg in the attack and was taken to hospital where she is in a stable condition.

"Organisers of 3,000-strong rave hit with Â£10k fine","An estimated 3,000 people have been at the event in the Dulais Valley in Neath Port Talbot The organisers of a rural rave which attracted 3,000 people from around the UK have been fined Â£10,000 - days after tougher penalties came into force. Police criticised the ""irresponsible"" actions of those at the unlicensed and illegal rave in south Wales at Banwen, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons. About 1,000 people remain on the site and police, who have removed some music equipment, will stay through the night. South Wales Police has given two organisers Â£10,000 fixed penalty fines. It comes two days after tougher penalties come into force in Wales, withillegal rave organisers facing unlimited fines or fixed penalties of up to Â£10,000. The Welsh Government's coronavirusrestrictionsallow for up to 30 people to meet outdoors. More than 500 at forest rave as new rules in force ""Those gathering know that their actions are irresponsible,"" said Supt Jason James. ""Events of this kind are illegal and have a significant impact on the community. A number of people have left the site but there are still around a thousand people in attendance and we will continue to have resources at the location throughout the night."" One man living 14 miles away said he was kept awake by the noise The force said it had deployed ""significant resources at the site throughout the day"" and was using new Covid-19 legislation, although Supt James said: ""We need to ensure that any action taken is done so safely."" As well as fining two of the organisers Â£10,000 each, officers have also penalised people for ""using their vehicles in an antisocial manner"" near the site of the rave in Neath Port Talbot. ""After everyone's sacrifices during Covid it's totally unacceptable,"" Chief Constable Matt Jukes wrote onTwitter,external. Police think ravers travelled from across the UK to the illegal event in Banwen ""Those gathering in large numbers and engaging in antisocial behaviour will know that their actions are irresponsible,"" said the force. ""To the parents or guardians of young people, we would ask you ensure that you know where your children are and what they are doing."" Jill Molen, from Banwen, called the party ""horrendous"". Jill Molen said people ""couldn't sleep at all"" ""We couldn't sleep at all; people peeing in the street and taking drugs - screaming and shouting. ""The noise was there all the time. It was a constant beat and banging. ""We've all been really good with social distancing and Covid and this just wrecks it."" Jamie Bowen lives in Resolven, in the Neath Valley, about 14 miles from the rave. He said he could hear ""really loud music"" from 03:00 BST. ""There must have been loads of complaints, as it is up in the mountain area, so the sound travels down,"" he said. ""It wasn't in your face sort of music, but you could still hear it from a great distance, like this constant thudding noise."" Police were called to the village on Sunday morning Chief Supt Simon Belcher from South Wales Police said: ""This type of illegal gathering is totally unacceptable and we are aware of the concerns it is causing for the local community. ""It has been estimated there are up to 3,000 people at the gathering who have apparently travelled from across the UK and we are looking at all pieces of legislation as to what action can be undertaken safely. ""Unlawfully parked cars will be dealt with and people who continue, despite our advice, to try and attend this illegal event area being turned away.""

Mass protest keeps pressure on Belarus president,"This video can not be played Dozens arrested in Belarus as they took to the streets over the 9 August election, widely believed to have been rigged Tens of thousands have again taken to the streets in Belarus, facing off against riot police to protest against President Alexander Lukashenko. A huge police presence cordoned off areas such as Independence Square in the capital, Minsk, and the interior ministry reported at least 140 arrests. Protesters chanted ""disgrace"" and ""leave"" in standoffs with police. Belarus has been gripped by mass protests since the 9 August election, widely believed to have been rigged. What's happening in Belarus? Shocked by violence, Belarusians lose their fear Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, has said he has no intention of stepping down and denies electoral fraud. It was very tense, with large numbers of riot police facing off against lines of protesters carrying balloons, flowers and red-and-white opposition flags. Reporting at the height of the protests, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Minsk said there were far more police than on the past two Sundays when similar rallies were held. Some protesters lay down on the road to try to prevent riot police from moving, with others chanting ""disgrace"" and ""go away"". Some mocked Mr Lukashenko on his 66th birthday, carrying a cockroach puppet and chanting ""happy birthday, you rat"". Many streets were blocked off by police to try to prevent people reaching the main protest areas. One large group of protesters marched towards Mr Lukashenko's residence at the Independence Palace, which was heavily protected by riot police and water cannon vehicles. Armoured personnel carriers were seen moving in the area, although reports later said they were also seen leaving and that the crowds were dispersing largely peacefully. Other smaller protests were reported in towns such as Brest and Grodno. Vast numbers gathered around the Hero City monument in Minsk to demand the end of President Lukashenko's rule Journalists continue to face issues reporting the unrest. On Saturday, the authorities withdrew the accreditation of 17 reporters, most of them Belarusian citizens who have been reporting for foreign media outlets. Two journalists with the BBC's Russian service were among those affected. In a statement, the BBC said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this stifling of independent journalism"". On Sunday, Germany said it was summoning the Belarus ambassador over the revocations of accreditation. Another Sunday. Another big protest. But this one felt different from previous weekends. Having cordoned off Independence Square in the centre of Minsk, police made a move against some of the protesters. Following scuffles, suddenly there were riot police everywhere: banging their shields on the ground as a warning, and then pushing demonstrators further down the road. But the police couldn't stop the protest from re-locating to another part of the city. What happens next in Belarus depends on many things: on the determination of protesters to keep taking to the streets; on whether Mr Lukashenko's security forces stay loyal to him; and on decisions taken to the East - in the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin has already made it clear he's keeping a close eye on events in Belarus. This video can not be played BBC's Steve Rosenberg amid the stand-off between protesters and riot police There is no direct word, although the interior ministry confirmed 140 arrests. Mr Lukashenko's press secretary sent Russian media outlet Ria Novosti a picture of him carrying a machine gun outside the Independence Palace. Allow Twitter content?

Last Sunday,he was seen wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle. Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Mr Lukashenko on his birthday and reportedly invited him to visit Moscow. It appeared to be the latest sign of Kremlin support for a president who has not always been seen positively by Russia. But Mr Putin has said he has formed a police reserve force to intervene in Belarus if necessary, although ""it won't be used until the situation gets out of control"". Unrest in Belarus was triggered earlier this month by an election widely believed to have been rigged in favour of Mr Lukashenko. Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest The leading opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was detained the day after the vote and left for Lithuania, from where she has since called for protests. Belarus has seen unprecedented opposition demonstrations and workers have staged walkouts at major state enterprises. Thousands have been arrested and there have been numerous reports of police brutality. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? At least four people have died and hundreds have been injured. The European Union and the US are among those to reject the election as neither free nor fair. The EU is preparing sanctions against officials it accuses of rigging the result to deliver Mr Lukashenko's victory and of cracking down on the opposition movement. Mr Lukashenko claimed a sixth term when election authorities said he had won 80% of the vote. But Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had won 60-70% based on results that had been properly counted. A criminal case has targeted the Co-ordination Council, which has since been set up by the opposition. Mr Lukashenko accuses it of trying to seize power.

Bunker partygoers poisoned by carbon monoxide,"Around 200 people are thought to have attended the rave Twenty-five people have been taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning after attending an illegal rave in a bunker in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. Five are in a critical condition and two police officers who tended to the partygoers are among those poisoned. Authorities believe the poisoning was caused by portable generators. Police say the ""Rave Cave"" event, attended by some 200 people, was discovered by chance when a patrol met a group of confused young people. Country profile Several more then emerged from the bunker and asked for an ambulance. It was not immediately known who had organised the underground event which was reportedly planned three weeks in advance and kept secret from the authorities. Oslo police say they are investigating why a tip-off about the rave was not acted upon. Emergency services found seven people unconscious in the bunker in the city's St Hanshaugen area. The lives of all of the victims, believed to be mainly aged between 20 and 30, are said to be out of danger but police have called for other attendees to seek medical attention if they start suffering from nausea, headaches or dizziness. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gasproduced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. The gas is harmful because it displaces oxygen from red blood cells, resulting in damage to major organs. One man who left before police arrived told public broadcaster NRK he had gone outside repeatedly for fresh air after arriving for the rave at 23:00 (21:00 GMT) on Saturday. ""When you rave in a room without windows with 50 to 60 others, the air becomes heavy,"" the unnamed man said. ""I had to go out several times and breathe fresh air."" The same man said other parties had been held in the same bunker this summer. Generators were being used to power lighting and sound systems, Norwegian media report. Vidar Haukeland, head ofthe company which owns the bunker, Stiftelsen Diakonissehuset Lovisenberg, described the rave as a ""serious break-in"",externaland said the company did not feel any responsibility, VG newspaper reports. Boards covering the entrance to the bunker had been removed, the paper says. Earlier this month, Norway banned the serving of alcohol in bars after midnight until further notice after a rise in coronavirus infections. The ban is due to be reviewed in September,external, Health Minister Bent HÃ¸ie told Aftenposten newspaper.

Black Panther director pays tribute to Boseman,"Ryan Coogler and Chadwick Boseman at the European premiere of Black Panther in 2018 Black Panther director Ryan Coogler has written a long and loving tribute to the film's star Chadwick Boseman, who has died aged 43. ""Chad was an anomaly. He was calm. Assured. Constantly studying,"" wrote the director on Sunday morning. ""The ancestors spoke through him,"" he added. ""What an incredible mark he's left for us."" Boseman died on Thursday at home in Los Angeles with his wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, and family by his side. He had been diagnosed with bowel cancer four years ago, undergoing treatment while filming hit movies like Avengers: Endgame, 21 Bridges and Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods. However, he never discussed his diagnosis in public, and Coogler said ""he shielded his collaborators from his suffering."" Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman dies of cancer 'Wakanda forever': Tributes pour in 'What Black Panther means to black people like me' Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman on being 'young, gifted and black' Here is the director's statement in full. Before sharing my thoughts on the passing of the great Chadwick Boseman, I first offer my condolences to his family who meant so very much to him. To his wife, Simone, especially. I inherited Marvel and the Russo Brothers' casting choice of T'Challa. It is something that I will forever be grateful for. The first time I saw Chad's performance as T'Challa, it was in an unfinished cut of Captain America: Civil War. I was deciding whether or not directing Black Panther was the right choice for me. I'll never forget, sitting in an editorial suite on the Disney Lot and watching his scenes. His first with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, then, with the South African cinema titan, John Kani as T'Challa's father, King T'Chaka. It was at that moment I knew I wanted to make this movie. After Scarlett's character leaves them, Chad and John began conversing in a language I had never heard before. It sounded familiar, full of the same clicks and smacks that young black children would make in the States. The same clicks that we would often be chided for being disrespectful or improper. But, it had a musicality to it that felt ancient, powerful, and African. In my meeting after watching the film, I asked Nate Moore, one of the producers of the film, about the language. ""Did you guys make it up?"" Nate replied, ""That's Xhosa, John Kani's native language. He and Chad decided to do the scene like that on set, and we rolled with it."" I thought to myself, ""He just learned lines in another language, that day?"" I couldn't conceive how difficult that must have been, and even though I hadn't met Chad, I was already in awe of his capacity as actor. I learned later that there was much conversation over how T'Challa would sound in the film. The decision to have Xhosa be the official language of Wakanda was solidified by Chad, a native of South Carolina, because he was able to learn his lines in Xhosa, there on the spot. He also advocated for his character to speak with an African accent, so that he could present T'Challa to audiences as an African king, whose dialect had not been conquered by the West. Black Panther was nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture, and won three I finally met Chad in person in early 2016, once I signed onto the film. He snuck past journalists that were congregated for a press junket I was doing for ""Creed,"" and met with me in the green room. We talked about our lives, my time playing football in college, and his time at Howard studying to be a director, about our collective vision for T'Challa and Wakanda. We spoke about the irony of how his former Howard classmate Ta-Nehisi Coates was writing T'Challa's current arc with Marvel Comics. And how Chad knew Howard student Prince Jones, who's murder by a police officer inspired Coates' memoir Between The World and Me. I noticed then that Chad was an anomaly. He was calm. Assured. Constantly studying. But also kind, comforting, had the warmest laugh in the world, and eyes that seen much beyond his years, but could still sparkle like a child seeing something for the first time. That was the first of many conversations. He was a special person. We would often speak about heritage and what it means to be African. When preparing for the film, he would ponder every decision, every choice, not just for how it would reflect on himself, but how those choices could reverberate. ""They not ready for this, what we are doingâ¦"" ""This is Star Wars, this is Lord of the Rings, but for usâ¦ and bigger!"" He would say this to me while we were struggling to finish a dramatic scene, stretching into double overtime. Or while he was covered in body paint, doing his own stunts. Or crashing into frigid water, and foam landing pads. I would nod and smile, but I didn't believe him. I had no idea if the film would work. I wasn't sure I knew what I was doing. But I look back and realize that Chad knew something we all didn't. He was playing the long game. All while putting in the work. And work he did. This video can not be played Chadwick Boseman: Five things to know He would come to auditions for supporting roles, which is not common for lead actors in big budget movies. He was there for several M'Baku auditions. In Winston Duke's, he turned a chemistry read into a wrestling match. Winston broke his bracelet. In Letitia Wright's audition for Shuri, she pierced his royal poise with her signature humour, and would bring about a smile to T'Challa's face that was 100% Chad. While filming the movie, we would meet at the office or at my rental home in Atlanta, to discuss lines and different ways to add depth to each scene. We talked costumes, military practices. He said to me ""Wakandans have to dance during the coronations. If they just stand there with spears, what separates them from Romans?"" In early drafts of the script. Eric Killmonger's character would ask T'Challa to be buried in Wakanda. Chad challenged that and asked, ""What if Killmonger asked to be buried somewhere else?"" Chad deeply valued his privacy, and I wasn't privy to the details of his illness. After his family released their statement, I realised that he was living with his illness the entire time I knew him. Because he was a caretaker, a leader, and a man of faith, dignity and pride, he shielded his collaborators from his suffering. He lived a beautiful life. And he made great art. Day after day, year after year. That was who he was. He was an epic firework display. I will tell stories about being there for some of the brilliant sparks 'till the end of my days. What an incredible mark he's left for us. I haven't grieved a loss this acute before. I spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say, that we weren't destined to see. It leaves me broken knowing that I won't be able to watch another close-up of him in the monitor again or walk up to him and ask for another take. It hurts more to know that we can't have another conversation, or Facetime, or text message exchange. He would send vegetarian recipes and eating regimens for my family and me to follow during the pandemic. He would check in on me and my loved ones, even as he dealt with the scourge of cancer. The star and his director at the 2016 Comic-Con in San Diego In African cultures, we often refer to loved ones that have passed on as ancestors. Sometimes you are genetically related. Sometimes you are not. I had the privilege of directing scenes of Chad's character, T'Challa, communicating with the ancestors of Wakanda. We were in Atlanta, in an abandoned warehouse, with bluescreens, and massive movie lights, but Chad's performance made it feel real. I think it was because from the time that I met him, the ancestors spoke through him. It's no secret to me now how he was able to skilfully portray some of our most notable ones. I had no doubt that he would live on and continue to bless us with more. But it is with a heavy heart and a sense of deep gratitude to have ever been in his presence, that I have to reckon with the fact that Chad is an ancestor now. And I know that he will watch over us, until we meet again. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"India sets new daily Covid case recordThe 78,761 new cases reported on Sunday is the largest number for a day anywhere in the world.India","Doctors say India has to do more to increase its testing India has set a record for the world's highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases. The nation, the world's third-most infected, on Sunday reported 78,761 new cases in 24 hours, passing the number posted in the US on 17 July. The rise comes as the government continues to lift restrictions to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. An upsurge of Covid-19 in many rural areas continues to be a major concern. On Sunday, global infections passed the 25 million mark, with 843,000 deaths. The US remains the most affected nation, closing in on six million infections,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. India's single-day tally on Sunday passed the one-day increase of 77,299 reported by the United States on 17 July. Cardiology doctor, Manoj Kumar, told Reuters: ""It is the largest one-day surge in cases worldwide and the reason behind this - because the pandemic is spreading in the rural areas."" How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing? In the initial stages of Covid-19, India appeared to be doing fairly well, imposing a strict lockdown, but the virus then hit megacities like Mumbai and Delhi, before surging in smaller cities and rural areas. Despite the increase, the government has pressed ahead with easing restrictions. Gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed at cultural, entertainment and sports events from next month, with face mask and social distancing measures. Underground train networks will also start to reopen in big cities. It is feared India's reporting of deaths has been far too low Dr Rajiv Parekh, chairman of the Medanta division of peripheral vascular and endovascular sciences, told Reuters: ""People thought that once the numbers started to go down, this was it, they had won the war.... everybody was out there without wearing a mask, without any social distancing. ""That is something that we should not have allowed to have happened."" Doctors also say under-reporting and limited testing remain major concerns. The figure of 63,000 deaths in India is roughly on a par with Mexico. But infections in the central American nation are only at 591,000, compared to India's 3.5 million. India's government collates the number of deaths from positive cases but not from suspected infections. On testing, virologist Shahid Jameel, who heads the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, told Agence France Presse: ""Testing per million in India at 30,000 remains the second lowest in top 10 [virus-infected] countries."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his monthly radio address without mentioning the latest milestone. He called on citizens to observe the rules and remain united to try to defeat coronavirus. ""It is important that every citizen is healthy and happy and we defeat coronavirus completely together,"" Mr Modi said. ""Corona can only be defeated when you remain safe, when you fulfil the resolve of keeping a safe distance of two metres and wearing masks.

Anger after attempt to storm German parliament,"Some protesters broke through to the Reichstag before being dispersed An attempt to storm Germany's parliament building during protests against Covid-19 restrictions has been condemned by politicians across the political spectrum. Demonstrators, many with far-right sympathies, broke through a cordon and ran up the steps of the parliament building before police dispersed them. The interior minister said there should be ""zero tolerance"" for such behaviour. Some 38,000 turned out for the wider, largely peaceful Berlin demonstration. Demonstrators bearing the flag of former imperial Germany - used by the ReichsbÃ¼rger (Reich Citizens) far-right group - overcame a handful of police to run to the entrance of the Reichstag Building in Berlin. Police put the number involved at several hundred. Scuffles broke out and the protesters were then overcome by police using pepper spray. Several people were arrested. Police rejected criticism of their small deployment, saying they could not ""be everywhere all the time"". This video can not be played Thousands took to the streets of Berlin in August 2020 to rally against coronavirus restrictions ""The Reichstag is the domain of our parliament and the symbolic centre of our democracy. It is unbearable that troublemakers and extremists misuse it for their own purposes,"" said Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. President Frank Walter Steinmeier condemned ""an unbearable attack on the heart of our democracy"". Police cleared the entrance to the Reichstag after the attempted storming ""Those angered by our coronavirus measures or who doubt their necessity can do so openly, in protests. But my tolerance ends when protesters hitch themselves to the wagon of enemies of democracy and political rabble-rousers."" Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, from the Social Democrats, was one of several to condemn the display of far-right and German imperial symbols. The Social Democrats have also called for improved security around parliament. The organiser of the main protest, tech entrepreneur Michael Ballweg, said the demonstrators had ""nothing to do"" with his movement. The protest had originally been banned but a court eventually allowed it to go ahead on condition that coronavirus measures such as mask-wearing and social-distancing were adhered to. In all, 300 people were arrested at various locations, 200 after right-wing agitators threw stones and bottles near the Brandenburg Gate. Police ordered the dispersal of the protest as the day went on because those taking part were failing to observe coronavirus rules. Protesters were closely packed in places, and sat together on the ground at one point. Attila Hildmann spoke to protesters outside the Russian Embassy on Unter den Linden Among those arrested was cookery author and conspiracy theorist Attila Hildmann, who had addressed crowds through a loudspeaker. Although Germany has so far not seen the wave of cases affecting some parts of Europe, its infection rate has been growing. New case numbers are reaching highs last seen in April. The demonstration was called by the Stuttgart-based movement Querdenken 711 (or Lateral Thinking 711). The group has more than 16,000 followers on Facebook and communicates largely through encrypted messaging service Telegram. It believes that coronavirus regulations infringe on basic rights and freedoms enshrined in Germany's constitution and wants them to be lifted. The protests have also gained support from Robert F Kennedy Jr. The anti-vaccination campaigner, also the son of assassinated US Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy and nephew of assassinated US President John F Kennedy, was at the demonstration in Berlin. Photos shared online also showed flags and slogans linked to the conspiracy theory QAnon. What is QAnon? The protests have drawn a range of different groups Participants also included families and children. Some people have said they just want the right to protest. Counter-protests against the main march also took place, with about 100 people at one rally. ""You are marching with Nazis and Fascists,"" shouted some participants, according to broadcaster RBB. The country was one of the most effective in enforcing the framework of response referred to as prevent, detect, contain and treat. It has been particularly effective in keeping the death rate among the over 70s lower. It began relaxing physical distancing in early April but continued to track infections, which have seen a rise in August. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the 16 federal states introduced a minimum â¬50 (Â£45; $59) fine for failing to wear a face mask where ordered. A ban on major public events was also extended until next year. Germany has recorded 242,000 infections, fewer than the other major European nations. Its figure of 9,297 deaths is considerably lower than the numbers in Russia, the UK, Spain, France and Italy,Johns Hopkins University research shows,external. What are the rules around Europe?
