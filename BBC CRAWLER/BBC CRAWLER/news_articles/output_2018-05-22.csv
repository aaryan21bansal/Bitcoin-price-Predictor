500 Tesco website jobs under threat,"Tesco plans to close its Tesco Direct website that sells general merchandise, putting 500 jobs at risk. The retailer said the non-food website was a ""small, loss-making part of the business"" and had ""no route to profitability"". Tesco said the site faced high delivery and marketing costs that meant it could not work as a standalone business. It will close the Direct site on 9 July and the Fenny Lock distribution centre in Milton Keynes in late August. The decision means about 500 workers are now at risk of redundancy. Tesco bins some 'use by' dates How can M&S get back in fashion? Charles Wilson, Tesco's UK chief, said the retailer wanted to focus on one website so that customers could buy groceries and non-food items in one place. ""This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,"" he said. Joanne McGuinness, national officer for the Usdaw union, said the decision was devastating news for Tesco Direct staff. ""Our priorities will be to support, advise and represent our members through this difficult period and to get the best possible deal for them,"" she said. Clive Black at Shore Capital said Tesco Direct had been a ""running sore"" and lost money since its inception in 2006. ""This is a clear signal that the company is taking decisive action and is the first demonstrable statement by Charles Wilson since he joined the group in early March,"" he added. Anika Newjoto, editor of shopperpoints.co.uk, a site that covers supermarket loyalty schemes, said the closure of Tesco Direct did not come as a surprise. ""Even with advantages such as Clubcard points and 'click and collect' delivery to Tesco stores it is incredibly difficult to compete with Amazon these days,"" she said. ""Sainsbury's closed its Entertainment site a couple of years ago and if Tesco can't make it work it is difficult to see who can. Whilst Tesco is promising to add non-food lines to the grocery website I would be very surprised if this is much more than a small selection."" Tesco Mobile products will remain available on Tesco.com, along with its uniform embroidery service. The grocery-focused site is used by an average of 100,000 customers a day.

Carney: Brexit has cost households Â£900,"The Brexit vote has left households worse off, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said. The vote to leave the European Union had lowered growth by ""up to 2%"", he told MPs on Tuesday. However, there could be a ""sharp pick-up"" in business investment when a Brexit agreement is struck, he said. Meanwhile, new figures showed the government finances have continued to improve, potentially giving the Chancellor more Budget spending power. Giving evidence to the Treasury Committee, Mr Carney said: ""Real household incomes are about Â£900 lower than we forecast in 2016. The question is why and what drove that difference. Some of it is ascribed to Brexit."" Asked about the governor's comments on a visit to Argentina, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""I believe the Chancellor of the Exchequer [Philip Hammond] has given an authoritative opinion on this matter, which is that it is absolutely not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country."" Mr Carney said business investment was still being held back, but there was a chance of a ""sharp pick-up"" when the Brexit agreement is finalised. ""It's understandable why businesses are holding back - there's some big decisions that are about to be made - why wouldn't they want to wait until the path becomes clearer?"" he told MPs. Meanwhile, the government borrowed Â£7.8bn in April - the lowest figure for April since 2008, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalalso revised the borrowing figure for last year to Â£40.5bn, down from its previous estimate of Â£42.6bn. The deficit was 2% of GDP last year - the lowest rate since 2002. When George Osborne took over as Chancellor in 2010, borrowing stood at 9.9% of GDP. Several years of austerity helped cut that figure and a policy of restricted spending has continued under Mr Hammond. Bank holds rates as UK hits 'soft patch' ""The public finances were boosted in April by strong income tax receipts, which was helped by the strong rise in employment over the early months of 2018,"" noted Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. How much money the Chancellor will have to play with will depend on how the economy performs this year. The year got off to a disappointing start when bad weather restricted growth to just 0.1% in the first quarter. However, Mr Carney has reiterated his view that the slowdown is temporary: ""Our view is not that circumstances changed in the first quarter. It's more likely to have been temporary and idiosyncratic factors that slowed the economy."" Analysis:Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor With public sector net borrowing now Â£4.7bn below the Office for Budget Responsibility's official forecast - record levels of employment are keeping tax receipts healthy - a little bit of ""wriggle room"" has certainly opened up in the public finances. If the trend continues, the government could announce more spending in the autumn Budget and still be on course to hit its own target of balancing borrowing and spending by the middle of the next decade. Of course there are many - including in the Labour Party - who say the Conservative focus on ""balancing the books"" and eliminating the deficit is the wrong approach and the government should borrow more to invest. Philip Hammond, a fiscal conservative, sees a different challenge. As the deficit falls, colleagues could become bolder in their spending requests. And the balance between keeping ""control"" of the public finances and loosening the spending reins may tip towards the latter. The government has already made it clear the NHS is set for a major Budget boost. Details of that are expected imminently. If the economy does bounce back from its stupor in the first three months, as the Bank of England expects, then the chancellor could be rather more generous on spending by the end of the year than he may originally have expected.

Trees of Hope mark arena attack,"St Ann's Square became the focus for tributes People can mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack on a tree trail planted in the city. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May last year. Members of the public are invited to attach messages to 28 trees planted between Victoria Station - near the concert venue - and St Ann's Square. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said it would be a ""moving and memorable sight"". The attack also left more than 800 people with physical and psychological injuries after suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device. Hundreds were injured after the Ariana Grande pop concert Known as Trees of Hope, the trail is part of a programme of events, including a cathedral service and national one-minute silence, to mark the first anniversary. Members of the public can write messages on specially designed tags to be attached to the Japanese maple trees until the evening of 27 May. Bomb victim's gran to be royal plus-one Ariana Grande: Manchester attack 'the worst of humanity' Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Sir Richard said: ""It promises to be a moving and memorable sight, which will help people to reflect on last year's events."" Every message will be kept, along with last year's tributes, in an archive of the city's response to the attack, a council spokesperson said. Thousands gathered for a vigil outside Manchester Town Hall after the attack Compost made from some of last year's floral tributes will be used to nurture the trees, which will remain in the city centre. Any other tributes left in public spaces will be taken to be displayed at Wythenshawe Park. A minute's silence is to be held at the start of the Great Manchester 10k Run on Sunday afternoon. Singers will also perform in Albert Square on the evening of 22 May, while song lyrics will be projected around St Ann's Square between 22 and 26 May.

Trump says summit with Kim may be delayed,"This video can not be played Trump says Kim Jong-un's attitude changed after his second visit to China US President Donald Trump has said there is a ""very substantial chance"" a historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un next month may not happen. He said the North must meet conditions for the summit to go ahead though if it did not, it might happen ""later"". Mr Trump was speaking as he received South Korea's President Moon Jae-in at the White House. The North has said it may cancel the summit if the US insists on it giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally. Mr Trump did not say what conditions the US had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North's arsenal, he said ""denuclearisation must take place"". Trump-Kim 'peace talks' coin criticised North Korea crisis in 300 words The 12 June summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in April. Meanwhile, North Korea has agreed to let in journalists from the South to watch the dismantling of its nuclear test site. The group, who had earlier been denied visas, will join a team of international media who are in the country to visit Punggye-ri over the next few days. The demolition of the site has been billed as a goodwill gesture but may be delayed by bad weather. Mr Trump told reporters: ""We'll see what happens. ""There are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't we don't have the meeting. ""You go into deals that are 100% certain - it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance and it happens and, sometimes, happens easily."" He also said Kim Jong-un's attitude had changed after his second visit to China, earlier this month. Shaking hands at the (fake) DMZ Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Later in the day, during a news conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo adopted a more positive position, saying the US was still working towards the 12 June date. He commended China for offering ""historic assistance"" in putting pressure on North Korea. Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington The optimistic build-up to the summit gave way to a reality check that was bound to happen sooner or later. With Kim Jong-un tapping the brakes and refusing to accept ""unilateral demands"" to disarm, President Trump also took a step back. He set his own conditions, although he didn't say what they were. He did stress that it would be worth it for the North Korean leader to risk denuclearisation, throwing the ball back into Mr Kim's court. The build-up to the summit has been shaped by an unusual degree of public showmanship by both leaders, a diplomatic version of their hostile exchanges last year. But while the threats and insults worked at the rhetorical level, this is about substantive issues where the detail matters. President Moon Jae-in also has his spin. He really wants to seize this opportunity for South Korea's sake and continues to be determined in his optimism, leaving some here wondering whether he's been overstating Kim Jong-un's willingness to deal. North Korea cancelled high-level talks with South Korea, saying the South's joint military exercises with the US - which it had previously said it would tolerate - were a ""provocation"". This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Pyongyang then accused US national security adviser John Bolton of making ""reckless statements"" for hissuggestion that the North could follow a ""Libya model"" of denuclearisation. That was a reference to Libya's former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003 and was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Mr Trump later denied the US would follow the ""Libyan model"" if an agreement was reached with North Korea. ""That model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. It would be historic as no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Mr Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for direct talks after more than a year of heated rhetoric and with global concern that hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr Trump was asking aides and advisers whether the meeting should go ahead. North Korea conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and developed long-distance missiles which, it says, can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland. Many observers had argued before Mr Trump met Mr Moon that there was too much at stake for Washington and Pyongyang not to proceed with the Singapore summit. However, Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. A group of Western, Russian and Chinese journalists have been invited by the North to its remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site ahead of its demolition. They were flown into the North Korean port city of Wonsan but their onward journey was postponed by bad weather, Tom Cheshire from the UK's Sky News tweets. Allow Twitter content?

Mother forced teen daughter to marry,"A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been convicted in the first successful prosecution in England. The woman duped the then 17-year-old into travelling to Pakistan to wed the man, who was 16 years her senior. Years before the ceremony, the girl was entered into a ""marriage contract"" with the man and became pregnant aged 13. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage. Midlands Live: Murder arrest after fatal shooting; Lucky escape as lorry rolls on to car in bridge crash The court heard the girl had an abortion upon her return to the UK, with her GP reporting his concerns to social services. Prosecutors said her mother ""made all the right noises"" to suggest her daughter and the man were just ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"" after she was referred. As she approached her 18th birthday, the girl was tricked into travelling to Pakistan again under the pretence of a family holiday. Once there, the court was told, the girl, then aged 18, sobbed as her mother forced her to sign marriage papers in September 2016. Giving evidence during the trial, she recalled crying as her mother led her by the arm to meet her husband-to-be. ""I didn't want to get married to him,"" she said. When the daughter protested against the marriage, jurors heard, her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. Manchester attack: Remembering the victims Fireworks factory owner guilty of fire deaths Voter ID: Hundreds turned away from voting The girl ""has been let down badly by her mother, whose love and attention she craves,"" prosecutor Deborah Gould said. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked shocked as she was convicted of forced marriage and of deceiving the victim to go to Pakistan in order to enter into a false marriage. She was also convicted of perjury, after she lied about the incident in the High Court. The mother was cleared of a fourth charge of perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced on Wednesday. It is the first time a forced marriage case of this kind has been successfully prosecuted in an English court. Prosecutions for forced marriage, which became an offence in 2014, are rare. In 2015, a man was jailed for offences including forced marriageat Merthyr Crown Court in Wales, and there is currently at least one live case on-going. Supt Sally Holmes from West Midlands Police said up to 300 calls a month about forced marriage and honour-based abuse are reported by Karma Nirvana, an organisation supporting victims of honour related abuse, ""but a lot of victims will not want to report these matters to police"". ""It's their parents of family members who might be responsible for that abuse and they [victims] should feel absolutely no guilt in coming forward,"" she said. Elaine Radway, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and applauded the ""brave testimony"" of the victim.

Mission launches to weigh Earth's waterThe joint US-German Grace satellites go into orbit to monitor Earth's most important resource.1h42 minutes agoScience & Environment,"SpaceX rocket: Climbing above California before heading south towards Antarctica A joint US-German mission has gone into orbit to weigh the water on Earth. The Grace satellites,externalare replacing a pair of highly successful spacecraft that stopped working last year. Like their predecessors, the new duo will circle the globe and sense tiny variations in the pull of gravity that result from movements in mass. These could be a signal of the land swelling after prolonged rains, or of ice draining from the poles as they melt in a warming climate. The satellites were launched on Tuesday aboard a SpaceX rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force base in California. It will take a number of weeks to prepare and test the spacecraft before they can start gathering data. Space lasers to track Earth's ice Europe plans Sentinels expansion The satellites were assembled in Europe by Airbus The first Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace), which ran from 2002 to 2017, was widely regarded as transformative in the type of information it was able to gather, and maintaining the capability is now seen as a top priority for the American space agency (Nasa). The follow-on mission again draws heavily on expertise from Europe, in particular from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). Europe's biggest space company, Airbus, assembled the satellites at its factory in Friedrichshafen. The Grace duo will obtain their data by executing a carefully calibrated pursuit in orbit. As the lead spacecraft lurches and drags through the Earth's uneven gravity field, the second satellite will follow 220km behind, measuring changes in their separation to the nearest micron (a thousandth of a millimetre). ""That is about a tenth of the width of a human hair over the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego,"" Prof Frank Flechtner, the Grace-FO project manager at GFZ, told BBC News. What the Grace concept is brilliant at sensing is the big changes that occur in the hydrological cycle. Grace data can show whether agriculture is using groundwater in a sustainable way These could, for example, be major movements of water from the ocean to the land during precipitation events. ""There was a period in 2011 when sea-level rise slowed down and went in the other direction very briefly,"" explained Nasa project project scientist Dr Frank Webb. ""From the Grace data we could see there were heavy rain seasons in Australia and South America, and that equivalent of mass was going into storage on land. Eventually, it was released back to the oceans and sea-level rise continued."" The ice sheets are losing about 400 gigatonnes to the oceans every year One of the great contributions from the first Grace mission was to confirm the scale of change at the poles - to essentially weigh the ice sheets year on year. Satellites carrying altimeters can do this by measuring the change in shape of Antarctica and Greenland - but Grace provided completely independent insight through its gravity assessments. Antarctica was seen to be losing some 120 billion tonnes of ice a year; for Greenland, the figure was 280 billion tonnes. ""Mass loss from the ice sheets is an increasing contribution to total sea-level rise and, even though the poles are remote, this mass loss will have large impacts all around the world,"" said Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""With the launch of Grace-FO, we can now continue to detect changes in the ice mass, to determine the extent to which ice is being lost, and find out if there has been any acceleration,"" she told BBC News. The previous Grace pair used a microwave-ranging instrument to measure their separation. The new satellites carry the same technology, but have now a laser system incorporated as well. It should give a roughly 10 times improvement in precision. And although this is unlikely to deliver an equivalent jump in the resolution of the gravity field, scientists are still hopeful they can get significant gains in performance. The new pair will use both microwave and laser-ranging to measure their separation The total cost for Grace-FO is on the order of $520m (â¬440m; Â£390m). The mission should work for at least five years. As to what follows the follow-on, there is already talk about trying to widen involvement to include more EU member states. This could eventually see a future Grace-like gravity mission pulled into the European Commission's Sentinel Earth-observation programme. The same has already happened with the US-French Jason series, which has been measuring sea-surface height since 1992. Future Jasons will be known as the Sentinel-6 mission- a status that has helped secure long-term funding. ""I think it's important we get an operational mission,"" commented Prof Flechtner. ""The 'e' in Grace stands for 'experiment', but the data is now being used for services, such as flood monitoring. My strong opinion is that it could be a Sentinel."" To be clear, however, the EC does not have a gravity option amongthe possibilities it is currently scoping for Sentinel expansion.

Jada Pinkett Smith reveals hair loss,"Smith says wearing a headscarf makes her feel empowered Jada Pinkett Smith has opened up about her struggle with hair loss in the latest episode of her Facebook chat show, Red Table Talk. ""I've been getting a lot of questions about why I've been wearing this turban,"" said the US actress, 46. ""Well, I've been having issues with hair loss. And it was terrifying when it first started."" Doctors have not identified a cause but Smith believes it may be stress-related. TheGirls Tripstar says she first suspected she had the hair loss disease after ""handfuls of hair"" came loose in the shower. ""I was just like 'Oh my god am I going bald?' It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking with fear,"" she explained. ""That's why I cut my hair and continue to cut it."" Her comments feature in the third episode of her Facebook mini-series, co-hosted by her mother Adrienne Canfield Norris, and teenage daughter Willow Smith. Other topics discussed have included coping with loss, motherhood and body image - with Willow previously disclosing sheself-harmed as a childfollowing the release of her debut single Whip My Hair in 2010. Jada's daughter Willow had a hit single in 2010 with Whip My Hair Smith admitted she finds her hair loss ""difficult to talk about"" as taking care of it used to be a ""beautiful ritual"". However, she said, the fate of her body lies in a ""higher power"" and that accepting it has helped her find perspective to deal with the emotional impact of alopecia. ""People are out here with cancer, with sick childrenâ¦ I watch the higher power take things every day,"" she said, adding her hair loss pales by comparison. ""When I looked at it from that perspective it did settle me."" As a result of the physical changes, Smith begun wearing scarves on her head, which she said act as an empowering fashion choice.

"500 Tesco website jobs under threatSupermarket says Tesco Direct faces high costs, will not become profitable and will be closed.5h5 hours agoBusiness","Tesco plans to close its Tesco Direct website that sells general merchandise, putting 500 jobs at risk. The retailer said the non-food website was a ""small, loss-making part of the business"" and had ""no route to profitability"". Tesco said the site faced high delivery and marketing costs that meant it could not work as a standalone business. It will close the Direct site on 9 July and the Fenny Lock distribution centre in Milton Keynes in late August. The decision means about 500 workers are now at risk of redundancy. Tesco bins some 'use by' dates How can M&S get back in fashion? Charles Wilson, Tesco's UK chief, said the retailer wanted to focus on one website so that customers could buy groceries and non-food items in one place. ""This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,"" he said. Joanne McGuinness, national officer for the Usdaw union, said the decision was devastating news for Tesco Direct staff. ""Our priorities will be to support, advise and represent our members through this difficult period and to get the best possible deal for them,"" she said. Clive Black at Shore Capital said Tesco Direct had been a ""running sore"" and lost money since its inception in 2006. ""This is a clear signal that the company is taking decisive action and is the first demonstrable statement by Charles Wilson since he joined the group in early March,"" he added. Anika Newjoto, editor of shopperpoints.co.uk, a site that covers supermarket loyalty schemes, said the closure of Tesco Direct did not come as a surprise. ""Even with advantages such as Clubcard points and 'click and collect' delivery to Tesco stores it is incredibly difficult to compete with Amazon these days,"" she said. ""Sainsbury's closed its Entertainment site a couple of years ago and if Tesco can't make it work it is difficult to see who can. Whilst Tesco is promising to add non-food lines to the grocery website I would be very surprised if this is much more than a small selection.""

Sweden issues advice on preparing for war,"The leaflet suggests having candles and tea lights at the ready in case the electricity supply fails Salmon balls, tea lights and wet wipes. These are just some of the things Sweden has advised every household to stock up on in the case of war. Its government has sent leaflets to 4.7 million households explaining how to best prepare for various major crises. These include terror and cyber-attacks, natural disasters, serious accidents and military conflicts. Those who prepare improve ""the ability of the country as a whole to cope with a major strain"", the booklet reads. ""Think about how you and people around you will be able to cope with a situation in which society's normal services are not working as they usually do,"" it adds. Swedish security chief warning on fake news How Sweden became an exporter of jihad The leaflet, which is entitled If Crisis or War Comes, has been distributed,externalamid concerns over Russia's military activities and the rise of terrorism and fake news. Under a section called ""home preparedness tips"", there is an eclectic list of some of the key items it says every household should have access to. It stresses the importance of having non-perishable food ""that requires little water or can be eaten without preparation"", such as: Bread with a long shelf-life (eg tortillas and crackers) Precooked lentils, beans, tinned hummus Sardines and ravioli Quick-cook pasta, rice, instant mashed potatoes Prepared blueberry, rosehip soup, energy bars The leaflet advises households to stock up on foods with a long shelf life, such as rice and jam The leaflet also warns that, in a major crisis, the electricity supply may fail meaning your home will quickly become cold. ""Gather together in one room, hang blankets over the windows, cover the floor with rugs and build a den under a table to keep warm,"" it advises. If there is no electricity, it says people should prepare to keep warm and stay informed when communications systems are no longer working. Households can do so by having: Woollen clothes Sleeping bags Candles and tea lights A radio powered by batteries, solar cells or winding A list of important telephone numbers A mobile phone charger that works in the car Similar instructions were distributed during World War Two, but printing ceased in the 1980s, according to local media. The leaflet also includes advice on how to spot propaganda, find a bomb shelter and get clean water. Pages from the leaflet explaining Sweden's air raid warning system and public shelters Numerous governments have issued advice on how to best prepare for a major crisis or even war in recent years. In 2016,Germany advised people to stockpile food and waterfor use in a national emergency. It suggested storing enough food to last for 10 days as well as five days' worth of water. It was the first time since the Cold War the German government had issued this kind of advice, and some opposition MPs accused it of scaremongering. Also in 2016,Lithuania told its citizens what to do in the event of a Russian invasion. Its booklet included guides to spotting Russian tanks as well as surviving in the wild. Moscow's relations with its Baltic neighbours have deteriorated since 2014, when it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. In recent years, Sweden has increased its military spending, citing the deteriorating security situation in Europe, particularly in light of Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine. In 2016, it restored a troop presence on the strategic Baltic island of Gotland amid concerns over military drills by Moscow, and has debated whether to move closer to the Nato military alliance. It also reintroduced military conscription last year.

Forgetful couple offer lost car reward,"The car was parked in ""a really nice, quiet street"" somewhere in Cheltenham An elderly couple who forgot where they parked their car are offering a reward for it to be found. Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner Hilda Farmer, 79, parked ""within a mile and a half"" of Cheltenham General Hospital on Friday, but cannot remember where. Family and friends have spent four days searching for the Ford Fiesta with no success. The couple, from Gloucester, have offered Â£100 to anyone who locates the car. Mr Elliott said it was on a street with ""really nice houses on one side and some kind of greenery on the other"". Ms Farmer dropped her partner off for a hospital appointment and drove off to find somewhere to park. ""I don't know Cheltenham very well at all. I was born in Gloucester,"" she said. The vehicle was left ""within a mile and half"" of Cheltenham General Hospital ""I'm frightened of Cheltenham. I [normally] always go on the bus."" Mr Elliott said his partner parked the silver Ford Fiesta - registration EJ12 VSP -  in ""a really nice, quiet street"" at about 14:30 BST on Friday.

""On the other side there was greenery - maybe a park or a field. ""Ours was the only car parked on that side of the road, alongside the greenery."" It took Ms Farmer about 30 minutes to walk from the car, so it was probably ""within a mile and half"" of the hospital, Mr Elliott said. Police had told him they were ""fairly confident"" the vehicle will still be where it was left, he added.

US couple sue son who refuses to move out,"Michael Rotondo, 30, appeared in court on Tuesday The parents of a 30-year-old man have resorted to drastic measures in an effort to get their son to fly the coop: they are suing him. Court documents say Michael Rotondo does not pay rent or help with chores, and has ignored his parents' offers of money to get him settled. Despite doling out five eviction letters, Christina and Mark Rotondo say their son still refuses to move out. Michael is arguing that legally, he was not given enough notice to leave. Mr and Mrs Rotondo filed their case with the Onondaga County Supreme Court, near Syracuse, New York, on 7 May, after months of unsuccessfully urging their son to leave. The would-be empty nesters' lawyer, Anthony Adorante,told Syracuse.com,externalthe couple did not know how else to get their adult son out of their house. ""We have decided that you must leave this house immediately,"" reads the first letter, dated 2 February, according to court filings. The home near Syracuse, New York that is at the centre of the family dispute When Michael ignored the letter, his parents wrote up a proper eviction notice with the help of their lawyer. ""You are hereby evicted,"" a 13 February notice signed by Mrs Rotondo reads. ""A legal enforcement procedure will be instituted immediately if you do not leave by 15 March 2018."" Sex and dating when you live with your parents Eviction threat over crying baby Why Utah now has first 'free-range' parenting law Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' The couple then offered their son $1,100 (Â£819) to move out - along with some sharp commentary about his behaviour. ""There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you. Get one - you have to work!"" they said. By 30 March, however, it was becoming clear their son had no intention of leaving. In April, Mr and Mrs Rotondo went to their local town court to see if they could evict their son. But they were told that because Michael is family, they would need a Supreme Court justice to officially send him packing. According to WABC News,external, Michael has called his parents' lawsuit ""retaliatory"" and has asked the court to toss out the request. The Rotondo family will take their case to Supreme Court later this month - some weeks ahead of Michael's 31st birthday. Sex and dating when you live with parents.

Thousands sing for attack victims,"This video can not be played Thousands attended the event in Manchester's Albert Square Over 3,500 singers have come together to lead a chorus of amateur voices in a mass sing-along to remember the Manchester Arena attack victims. Twenty-two people died and hundreds injured when a bomb was detonated outside a concert on 22 May 2017. Manchester Together in Albert Square featured songs by Elbow and Oasis. It followsa memorial service at Manchester Cathedral, which saw Prince William join political leaders and the families of the victims to remember. This video can not be played Who were the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena attack? Some of those who have gathered have a connection to what happened on the night, while others have come to show their support. Gina and Casey Hankey, from Stoke, said they were at the arena. ""We did the arena visits, so this is another step. The atmosphere has been good so far, but it's still a bit sad."" Rachel and Mia, from Bolton, said they had come ""to show we won't be beaten and show you carry on and remember those who died"". Julie, from Eccles, who came with her son Louis, said they wanted ""to pay our respects as it just touched everybody"". 'This is the place' -At the scene: Kaleigh Watterson, BBC News Last year, a vigil was held in Albert Square with thousands gathering to honour those who lost their lives and to show solidarity in the face of hatred. This year, thousands gathered again on the same spot in an atmosphere that was much more upbeat. Tony Walsh's poem This Is The Place, which left many in tears a year ago was this time set to a dance beat, with the crowd clapping along, cheering and giving it a rapturous round of applause. Tonight is emotional, there is no doubt about that, but it also feels like a celebration of Manchester's spirit, which guided the city in those dark days last May. Ahead of the singing, the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend David Walker, led those assembled in a minute's silence. He also told the crowd that the 22 candles lit in tribute to the victims at Manchester Cathedral had been made from the remnants of the hundreds left around the city in the aftermath of the attack. The crowd also heard from some of those singing, including two members of the A City United Choir, a one-off coming together of the signing groups attached to the city's Premier League football teams. Nine-year-old Molly said she was taking part because it was ""a good thing to do for all the people who can't be here"", while Matty, 14, said the unity in singing ""is what Manchester's all about"". Thousands crammed into Albert Square for the two-hour event The sing-along saw performances from 10 singing groups, including the Manchester Survivors Choir, who sang a tearful version of Andra Day's Rise Up to rapturous applause, and the Parrs Wood High School Harmony Group. The former is made up of people who were caught up the attack last year, while the latter saw their post-attack tribute - a version of Ariana Grande's My Everything - go viral and earn them the chance to perform with the star at the One Love Manchester concert. Many at the sing-along were wearing the bee emblem, a symbol of Manchester's defiance That concert was held two weeks after the homemade device was detonated outside Grande's concert. Daren Buckley, who is in Manchester Survivors' Choir, said he had found comfort in singing, but thathis recovery was far from complete. ""It's strange because I never used to have fear over anything. I have flashbacks,"" he said. ""I must've died 200 times in my nightmares."" The two-hour event saw the choirs sing versions of many popular songs, including Labi Siffre's Something Inside So Strong, Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, Emile Sande's Wonder, Clean Bandit's Symphony and Coldplay's Fix You. This video can not be played Bells rang out at St Ann's Church, Manchester Town Hall and St Mary's Roman Catholic Church It also saw poet Tony Walsh call for the crowd to join him in making a ""minute's noise for the 22"" and ""in solidarity with everyone that was injured, mentally and physically [and] for those who were first on the scene"". It concluded with a mass sing-along of five songs - Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger, Elbow's One Day Like This, Grande's One Last Time, Take That's Never Forget and The Beatles' All You Need Is Love. The Oasis song, which was introduced via a video message by Noel Gallagher, became an anthem of defiance in the aftermath of the attack and wassung by a crowd in Manchester's St Ann's Squarefollowing a minute's silence on 25 May 2017. People have been writing tributes to those who died on St Ann's Square's paving stones As happened a year ago, many people have once again left flowers in St Ann's Square From 21:30 BST, song lyrics chosen by members of the public will be projected onto its pavements and buildings.

Zuckerberg apologises to Europe for 'harm',"Mr Zuckerberg stayed beyond the allotted 75 minutes but did not answer all questions put to him Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to EU lawmakers for the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and for allowing fake news to proliferate on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg apologised for Facebook's tools being used ""for harm"". But his testimony did not please all MEPs at the meeting, some of whom felt he had dodged their questions. One leading UK politician later said the session at the European Parliament had been a ""missed opportunity"". ""Unfortunately the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point,"" said Damian Collins, chair of the UK Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee. The format was very different from that of Mr Zuckerberg's testimony to US lawmakers in April. Mr Zuckerberg met European Parliament President Antonio Tajani before the Q&A session While the US politicians took turns to cross-examine the Facebook chief in a series of back-and-forth exchanges, the leaders of the European Parliament's various political groups each asked several questions apiece. The tech chief had to wait until they were all delivered before responding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuckerberg spent 22 minutes going through the huge number of questions put to him during the session and was able to pick and choose which to give answers to. Several of the politicians expressed frustration at this, and one accused Mr Zuckerberg of having ""asked for this format for a reason"". A spokesman for Facebook later contacted the BBC to say it had not chosen the structure. This was subsequently confirmed by the parliament's president, Antonio Tajani. In a follow-up press conference, Mr Tajani added that the MEPs had been aware Mr Zuckerberg's time was limited yet had decided to use up much of the allotted period speaking themselves. He also drew attention to the fact that the chief executive had agreed to provide follow-up written answers. Mr Zuckerberg did not address questions about whether Facebook was a monopoly and how it plans to use data from its WhatsApp division. Nor did he directly answer questions about shadow profiles or whether non-Facebook users' data should be collected. Guy Verhofstadt had threatened not to attend when the event was set to be restricted from public view Several of the MEPs had also voiced scepticism about the business. Guy Verhofstadt MEP had asked Mr Zuckerberg if he wanted to be remembered as ""the genius who created a digital monster"", which the Facebook boss did not answer. British MEP and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage expressed his view that Facebook was not a politically neutral platform, asking whether the social network ""wilfully discriminated"" against right-of-centre commentators. Mr Zuckerberg did respond to this point, saying Facebook had ""never made a decision about what content was allowed on the basis of political orientation"". Tackling other questions, he also said he expected to find other apps that had misused customer data and pointed out that an internal investigation into thousands of third-party developers to see if there similar cases to the Cambridge Analytica scandal would take ""many months"". So far, he said, Facebook had suspended more than 200 apps. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal U-turn over Facebook chief's EU meeting Who's policing Facebook? The European Parliament has been left wanting more. The format of the meeting meant that rather than tackle specific concerns - particularly about the tracking of non-Facebook users - Mr Zuckerberg was able to group the questions into broad areas. That meant he could give broad answers. Reading any blog from the company published in the past three months would give you much the same information as we heard today. This clearly angered several MEPs, who expressed frustration over what they saw as insufficient responses to their concerns. Then again, how detailed can you be when you have been given less than half an hour to answer huge, almost existential, questions? Facebook is under close examination, but maybe so too should be the way politicians question these incredibly powerful figures. If you're following along, here's a scorecard for Mr Zuckerberg's ""tough"" committee appearances: Congress achieved little, Europe even less. The meeting between Mr Zuckerberg and the European Parliament's political group leaders had originally been planned to be held in private. But that sparked a wave of criticism resulting it being livestreamed via the web. One popular topic among the MEPs was an imminent shake-up of data privacy rules. Nigel Farage challenged Facebook's claims to impartiality Facebook recently transferred 1.5 billion of its international users from the jurisdiction of its European headquarters, in Ireland, to that of its US headquarters, with some speculating this was to avoid costly legal action resulting from breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The sweeping changes to data laws will give consumers much more control over how their personal details are used. Several of the MEPs challenged Mr Zuckerberg over whether he was truly committed to obeying the regulation. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? He responded that he expected Facebook would be fully compliant with the law by the time it came into force on Friday. He added that the app had already presented European members with the revised settings required and ""a large percentage"" of the users had already reviewed them. UK MPs are keen to pose their own questions to Mr Zuckerberg about the Cambridge Analytica scandal but the Facebook founder has so far declined to make a trip to the UK. Who's policing Facebook?

Blitz on sweet treats sees slow start,"The sugar hit in puddings, biscuits and chocolate has not been cut despite a government crackdown on sweet treats. Public Health England has set a target of reducing the sugar intake from a host of popular foods by a fifth by 2020. Its first year update shows progress in yoghurts and breakfast cereals, but not in other areas. PHE said it still represented a good start, although it expected faster progress in the coming years. On average, the public consume more than twice as much sugar as is recommended. PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie said: ""Tackling the obesity crisis needs the whole food industry to step up, in particular those businesses that have as yet taken little or no action."" Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate Britain 'needs to go on a diet' Soft drink sugar tax starts, but will it work? If progress is not made, ministers have made it clear they will consider legislation. But Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, said sugar reduction was ""challenging - it can't happen overnight"". ""Sugar reduction has considerable technical challenges,"" he said. ""Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food, including colour, texture and consistency. ""It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined."" PHE has identified 10 types of products in which it wants to see sugar levels reduced. The latest update covers the 12 months up to the summer of 2017, effectively the first year of the programme. A target of 5% had been set - but sugar levels have been reduced by just 2% in the products for which PHE currently has data. This data, from retailers and manufacturers, covers all of the 10 groups of foods except two - breakfast pastries and cakes. Food items sold in cafes and restaurants are also excluded from this current data, although they will be included in the future. The measuring of sugar levels is based on the amount per 100g (3.5oz) of all products, within the 10 categories, sold. So, to hit the target, industry must not only produce lower-sugar alternatives but also persuade consumers to buy more of them, in terms of weight, than of the products within the categories that retain higher levels. The big supermarket chains have cut the amount of sugar - known as reformulation - in many of their own-brand cereals, ice-creams and yoghurts. And big brands such as Muller have followed suit. The sugar content of its bestselling Corner strawberry twinpot has been cut by a fifth, to 12.6g per 110g. Meanwhile, Nestle has cut sugar in Kit Kats and Milkybars, adding extra milk - and, in the case of Kit Kats, cocoa - to retain their weights. But other companies have relied on making their higher-sugar products smaller so - counterbalanced by heavier lower-sugar products - they will carry less weight in their overall sugar-per-100g calculation. Costa Coffee teacakes have reduced in size. And Lidl has reduced the size of some of its chocolate bars by nearly a third. The third tactic relies on industry changing the habits of shoppers. For example, Rowntree has launched lower-sugar versions of Fruit Pastilles and Randoms. And others have promoted healthier options more heavily. PHE has provided anonymous information on the 20 brands that sell the most products with high sugar levels: 33% have seen a fall in sugar levels 56% have seen no change 12% have seen an increase While PHE is not naming these brands, the report did provide some individual company information by the different food groups. Some companies, such as Marks and Spencer, did not give PHE permission for its figures to be used, and in some categories data was not comparable between the two years. But there was some interesting variation in performance. Tesco and Morrisons for example saw falls in the sugar levels of all yoghurts sold, but Waitrose and the Co-op had not. Whereas for sweets, Waitrose saw the biggest improvement out of the 10 biggest supermarket chains, while Morrisons saw the worst. But in an appearance before MPs on Wednesday, PHE bosses came under fire for not naming and shaming companies. Health committe chair Sarah Wollaston said it seemed ""a bit of a shame"" given some companies had made progress and some had not. No. The sugar levy is a separate policy applied to high-sugar drinks. That came into force in April. This sugar-reduction programme is aimed at popular foods that account for a quarter of calories consumed by children. The drinks targeted by the sugar levy account for another 5%. And a separate calorie-reduction programme has been launched targeting foods such as pizzas, burgers and takeaways, which account for another 20%.. PHE has also announced on Tuesday that the sugar-reduction target will be extended to those drinks not covered by the sugar tax. These include milk-based drinks and juices.

Epic offers Â£74m Fortnite prize fund,"Epic Games is offering $100m prize fund for Fortnite players Publisher Epic Games has announced that it will be offering a prize pot of $100m (Â£74m) for Fortnite competitions. The prize fund has been set aside for the first year of competitive play of the popular game due to start later this year. It is believed to be the biggest sum of money offered for an e-sports tournament. Epic made the announcement in ablog post.,external It said: ""Fortnite Competitors! Grab your gear, drop in and start training. Since the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale we've watched the passion for community competition grow and can't wait to empower you to battle with the best. ""In the 2018-19 season, Epic Games will provide $100m to fund prize pools for Fortnite competitions. We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game."" Fortnite is a survival shooting game that lets players build structures out of materials they scavenge from the game world. No further details have been revealed at this stage but games industry experts believe the announcement is a smart marketing move by Epic. ""It is quite an impressive headline figure, but there is no detail on how the money is going to be divided, whether there will be a traditional tournament and a world champion player or lots of smaller tournaments."" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games research at IHS Markit. ""China's Tencent, who own part of Epic, have said that they plan to launch Fortnite in China, so, in effect, this is a very large marketing budget. ""Launching the game into a competitive e-sports market like China means that it is less of a gamble than the headline suggests,"" added Mr Harding-Rolls. He added that the game has not yet been established as an e-sports game so this would be a good way to try to ""establish itself as a major e-sports proposition"". E-sports is organised, competitive computer gaming and can be staged in front of a live audience and watched by millions more people online. Fortnite first was launched in June 2017. Its most popular format is the Battle Royale mode, launched in September of that year, which pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars.

Voter ID trial: 338 people turned away,"Returning officers said the vast majority of people voted after showing the correct ID About 340 people in five areas of England were turned away from voting in council elections because of a pilot scheme requiring proof of identity. At least 688 were initially stopped but later returned to the polling station with the correct documents. The Electoral Reform Society said requiring ID risked denying people their ""democratic right"". The government said an ""overwhelming majority"" of voters had the right documents. Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking councils tried out asking voters to present ID. In Bromley 154 were unable to vote, in Watford 66 could not vote - initial figures had showed the number was 64. In Woking it was 51, in Gosport it was 44 and in Swindon 25. A breakdown of the data published by Woking Borough Council showed a driving licence was the most common form of ID used. It was presented by 11,282 out of 18,735 voters at its polling stations. Just 43 people in Woking used a local elector card, which was offered by the council for free to anyone who did not have other acceptable means of proving their identity. Ray Morgan, Woking Borough Council's returning officer, said: ""Given that 99.73% of voters brought a correct form of ID and engaged positively with the pilot and only 0.27% did not, I think we can call this trial a great success. ""Following our experiences in the polling stations on 3 May, I see no reason why bringing ID to vote cannot be embedded in our democratic process and have already expressed my desire to the Cabinet Office that Woking continues to participate in any future trials."" Royal wedding guests sell gift bags online Airports with worst flight delays revealed How long are you going to live? A spokesman for the Electoral Reform Society said: ""Unfortunately we'll never know how many blameless voters stayed home or turned back before they even got to the polling desk in these trials, but any number is too high. These people would not have come into contact with polling station staff and therefore are not included in any official data. ""The local elections showed these trials to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted, with honest voters denied their democratic right to take part. They must not be used as an excuse to impose this flawed scheme across the UK."" The pilot tested different requirements in different areas. In Swindon and Watford, people only needed ID if they did not bring their polling card with them. In Gosport people could use photo ID such as a driving licence or passport or two other forms of ID, such as a birth certificate or recent utility bill. Bromley council said turnout compared ""favourably"" with previous local elections. Chief executive and returning officer Doug Patterson said: ""Though we have no reported voter fraud in the borough at present, I am proud that the council and the people of Bromley have helped the Cabinet Office look at how the integrity of our voting system can be maintained into the future."" A government spokeswoman said the ""overwhelming majority"" of voters had the right documents and were ""not adversely affected"". She said: ""The success of the voter ID pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take and voters were fully aware of the changes on polling day. ""We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally.""

Families walk out as Grenfell video shown,"Six members of the Choucair family spanning three generations died Families of those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire left an inquiry in tears after a video of the blaze was shown without a warning. One woman was said to have collapsed outside the hearing after seeing the video, which included footage filmed from inside the burning building. An inquiry official apologised, saying a warning system had failed. The second day has been dedicated to commemorations of those killed, including six members of one family. A nephew of one of the 72 victims said the bereaved wanted ""the truth"" and ""those in power"" must ""listen to our stories and learn from your mistakes."" Karim Mussily, whose uncle Hesham Rahman lived on the 23rd floor, earned a standing ovation from other relatives in the room when he told the inquiry: ""We've been censored enough, it's our time; whether you like it or not, you have to listen."" Tributes were paid to Hesham Rahman including by his sister Noha A video about the Choucair family started with clips of the fire in which people could be seen at windows surrounded by flames and screams could be heard. Between 20 and 30 people left the room and wails could be heard outside. The BBC's Emma Harrison said some were in extreme states of distress. The inquiry at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel, South Kensington, paused while the person who collapsed received medical treatment. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 2 What happened at the tower block? Bernard Richmond QC, who is leading the presentations by bereaved family members, said he was sorry a warning had not been read out before the film was shown. He said it had been a busy day and a system the inquiry had put in place for warning of troubling material had failed before this particular video was shown. When the hearing resumed, Mr Mussily said on a previous visit to his uncle the lift had been broken and the single staircase was narrow. He said: ""I couldn't help but think how on earth would my uncle escape if there was a fire."" Mierna, Fatima and Zainab Choukair died along with their grandmother and parents Hisam Choucair, who lost his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nieces in the blaze on 14 June 2017, had earlier told the inquiry how he could only watch helplessly as they died. Mr Choucair said the deaths of his mother Sirria, 60, sister Nadia, 30, her husband Bassem Choukair, 40, and their daughters Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and three-year-old Zainab was an ""atrocity"". He said he had ""always had a bad feeling"" about the building. Mr Choucair said when he got to the scene the building was ""completely engulfed in flames"" and he simply had to ""stand there for hours watching them all burn to death"". He said his mother, who arrived from Lebanon as a teenager in the 1970s, was ""loving, kind and patient"" while his sister and her husband, who lived two doors away from her in the block, were very popular and hard-working. He said his eldest niece, Mierna, had an ""excellent sense of humour"", loved sport, music and school and wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer. Bassem Choukair and his wife Nadia were very popular, the inquiry was told His sister Sawsam, who lived with their mother in the tower, also spoke of her grief. She said she managed to speak to Bassem on the phone during the fire, adding: ""His first thoughts were to reassure me. ""He told me everything was alright, even though he was trapped with my family in a burning building."" ByBBC reporter Emma Harrison Laughter fills the room during lighter moments of the tributes, as family members recall funny stories or traits of their loved ones. But the tears continue to flow as those reading emotional tributes struggle to maintain composure throughout their statements. The support and empathy towards those talking is strong, and the audience shows appreciation for their bravery with applause. As the first day had already witnessed, the common theme so far is how incomprehensible their deaths were and the need, as one family member put it, ""to find out the truth"". This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The second day of the inquiry also heard from the husband of Maria Del Pilar Burton, who is regarded as the final of the 72 victims. Mrs Burton, 74, who had dementia, died in January after her health deteriorated following the fire. In an emotional tribute, Nicholas Burton said it took away her ""dignity and everything we had in this world"". Maria Del Pilar Burton died in hospital in January Mrs Burton, known as Pily, was born in Spain in the 1940s and was one was one of the very first residents in Grenfell Tower. Mr Burton, who was with his wife for 34 years, told the inquiry she was an ""extraordinary woman"". He said: ""She was a unique, beautiful, exceptional person until this tragedy had taken it away."" Also commemorated were Rania Ibrahim, 30, and her daughters Fathia, five, and Hania, three, who lived on the 23rd floor of the building. Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fathia, known as Fou-Fou, and Hania, lived on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower Rasha Ibrahim said her sister moved to the UK from Egypt in 2009 but the pair remained very close. In a statement read to the inquiry by an interpreter, Mrs Ibrahim said: ""It is so important for me to understand how I have lost my beloved sister while my children have lost their little cousins."" Debbie Lamprell was 45 years old A tribute to Debbie Lamprell, a safety officer at Opera Holland Park, from her mother said the 45-year-old was ""always laughing"". Miriam Lamprell said she was ""bereft"" without her daughter and she felt a part of her had been ""ripped out"". A memorial stone has been placed at Opera Holland Park, where Debbie Lamprell worked Relatives of all 72 victims will be given the chance to commemorate loved ones during the inquiry, which will look into all the deaths. Families are being given as long as they need to tell the inquiry about their loved ones through a mixture of words, pictures and videos. A minute's silence was held at the start of the afternoon session to respectthe anniversary of the Manchester terrorist attack. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell: Unpacking our old life.

Moon meets Trump to discuss Kim summit,"This video can not be played Trump says Kim Jong-un's attitude changed after his second visit to China US President Donald Trump has said there is a ""very substantial chance"" a historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un next month may not happen. He said the North must meet conditions for the summit to go ahead though if it did not, it might happen ""later"". Mr Trump was speaking as he received South Korea's President Moon Jae-in at the White House. The North has said it may cancel the summit if the US insists on it giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally. Mr Trump did not say what conditions the US had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North's arsenal, he said ""denuclearisation must take place"". Trump-Kim 'peace talks' coin criticised North Korea crisis in 300 words The 12 June summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in April. Meanwhile, North Korea has agreed to let in journalists from the South to watch the dismantling of its nuclear test site. The group, who had earlier been denied visas, will join a team of international media who are in the country to visit Punggye-ri over the next few days. The demolition of the site has been billed as a goodwill gesture but may be delayed by bad weather. Mr Trump told reporters: ""We'll see what happens. ""There are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't we don't have the meeting. ""You go into deals that are 100% certain - it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance and it happens and, sometimes, happens easily."" He also said Kim Jong-un's attitude had changed after his second visit to China, earlier this month. Shaking hands at the (fake) DMZ Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Later in the day, during a news conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo adopted a more positive position, saying the US was still working towards the 12 June date. He commended China for offering ""historic assistance"" in putting pressure on North Korea. Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington The optimistic build-up to the summit gave way to a reality check that was bound to happen sooner or later. With Kim Jong-un tapping the brakes and refusing to accept ""unilateral demands"" to disarm, President Trump also took a step back. He set his own conditions, although he didn't say what they were. He did stress that it would be worth it for the North Korean leader to risk denuclearisation, throwing the ball back into Mr Kim's court. The build-up to the summit has been shaped by an unusual degree of public showmanship by both leaders, a diplomatic version of their hostile exchanges last year. But while the threats and insults worked at the rhetorical level, this is about substantive issues where the detail matters. President Moon Jae-in also has his spin. He really wants to seize this opportunity for South Korea's sake and continues to be determined in his optimism, leaving some here wondering whether he's been overstating Kim Jong-un's willingness to deal. North Korea cancelled high-level talks with South Korea, saying the South's joint military exercises with the US - which it had previously said it would tolerate - were a ""provocation"". This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Pyongyang then accused US national security adviser John Bolton of making ""reckless statements"" for hissuggestion that the North could follow a ""Libya model"" of denuclearisation. That was a reference to Libya's former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003 and was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Mr Trump later denied the US would follow the ""Libyan model"" if an agreement was reached with North Korea. ""That model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. It would be historic as no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Mr Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for direct talks after more than a year of heated rhetoric and with global concern that hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr Trump was asking aides and advisers whether the meeting should go ahead. North Korea conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and developed long-distance missiles which, it says, can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland. Many observers had argued before Mr Trump met Mr Moon that there was too much at stake for Washington and Pyongyang not to proceed with the Singapore summit. However, Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. A group of Western, Russian and Chinese journalists have been invited by the North to its remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site ahead of its demolition. They were flown into the North Korean port city of Wonsan but their onward journey was postponed by bad weather, Tom Cheshire from the UK's Sky News tweets. Allow Twitter content?

Danish minister prompts Ramadan row,"Ms Stojberg argues that an 18-hour fast could affect safety in some jobs in Denmark Denmark's immigration minister has been widely rebuffed after she suggested Muslims should take time off work during Ramadan because of potential safety risks to the rest of society. Inger Stojberg, who has a reputation for hardline immigration policies, said fasting throughout the working day raised challenges for modern society. She cited potential risks for bus drivers and in hospitals. Bus companies were among the first to say they had no problem with Ramadan. Arriva, which runs a number of bus routes in Denmark, said it had never had any accidents involving drivers who were fasting. ""So de facto it's not a problem for us,"" spokeswoman Pia Hammershoy Splittorff told Berlingske Tidende (BT) newspaper. The same message came from Denmark's 3F transport union, whose leader Jan Villadsen wondered if the minister was trying to create a problem that did not yet exist. Denmark's Muslim Union posted a message on social media thanking Ms Stojberg for her concern, but pointed out that Muslims were adults who were perfectly capable of looking after themselves and society, ""even when we fast"". A party colleague of the minister, Jacob Jensen, suggested politicians should focus on solving ""real problems"" rather than interfering. What is Ramadan? Should children be allowed to fast? How to exercise, eat and sleep well during Ramadan Inger Stojberg wrote in an opinion piece for BT (in Danish),externalthat Denmark had religious freedom and religion was a private matter. But she suggested that Muslims who observed Ramadan in Denmark could not eat or drink for more than 18 hours. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, which can occur at 21:29 in Denmark in June. Ms Stojberg said the demands of modern-day Denmark required long working days, sometimes involving operating dangerous machines. She gave the example of bus drivers who had not drunk or eaten for over 10 hours and suggested that fasting could affect ""safety and productivity"". ""I want to call on Muslims to take leave from work during the month of Ramadan to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society,"" she said. Why are countries taking refugees' valuables? Danes to double penalty for ghetto crime Migrants yield little cash for Denmark The integration minister is a centre-right politician from the liberal Venstre party who has been instrumental in tightening Denmark's immigration policy. She wrote an article last month in which she suggested that a ""significant proportion of refugees"" cheat or abuse the trust of Danes. Since her party formed a coalition government in 2015, Denmark has imposed a string of immigration controls to the extent that last year she posted a picture of a cake marking the 50th such amendment.

Two years ago Denmark approved a controversial measure to confiscate the valuables of asylum seekers to pay for their board and lodging. After the act drew comparisons with the Nazis' seizure of valuables from Jews in World War Two, wedding and engagement rings were excluded from the law. Other measures include tightening requirements for learning Danish, tougher citizenship tests and financial independence. Denmark saw a spike in arrivals of asylum seekers and irregular migrants in 2015 but the numbers have fallen significantly. Figures published this month by Politiken newspaper suggest that the number of Muslims successfully applying for citizenship in Denmark has also gone down. In 2014 70% of new citizenships were awarded to people from predominantly Muslim countries, and that figure has since fallen to 21%.

Mother forced teen daughter to marryThe girl became pregnant at 13 by a relative 16 years her senior whom she was later forced to marry.1h34 minutes agoBirmingham & Black Country,"A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been convicted in the first successful prosecution in England. The woman duped the then 17-year-old into travelling to Pakistan to wed the man, who was 16 years her senior. Years before the ceremony, the girl was entered into a ""marriage contract"" with the man and became pregnant aged 13. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage. Midlands Live: Murder arrest after fatal shooting; Lucky escape as lorry rolls on to car in bridge crash The court heard the girl had an abortion upon her return to the UK, with her GP reporting his concerns to social services. Prosecutors said her mother ""made all the right noises"" to suggest her daughter and the man were just ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"" after she was referred. As she approached her 18th birthday, the girl was tricked into travelling to Pakistan again under the pretence of a family holiday. Once there, the court was told, the girl, then aged 18, sobbed as her mother forced her to sign marriage papers in September 2016. Giving evidence during the trial, she recalled crying as her mother led her by the arm to meet her husband-to-be. ""I didn't want to get married to him,"" she said. When the daughter protested against the marriage, jurors heard, her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. Manchester attack: Remembering the victims Fireworks factory owner guilty of fire deaths Voter ID: Hundreds turned away from voting The girl ""has been let down badly by her mother, whose love and attention she craves,"" prosecutor Deborah Gould said. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked shocked as she was convicted of forced marriage and of deceiving the victim to go to Pakistan in order to enter into a false marriage. She was also convicted of perjury, after she lied about the incident in the High Court. The mother was cleared of a fourth charge of perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced on Wednesday. It is the first time a forced marriage case of this kind has been successfully prosecuted in an English court. Prosecutions for forced marriage, which became an offence in 2014, are rare. In 2015, a man was jailed for offences including forced marriageat Merthyr Crown Court in Wales, and there is currently at least one live case on-going. Supt Sally Holmes from West Midlands Police said up to 300 calls a month about forced marriage and honour-based abuse are reported by Karma Nirvana, an organisation supporting victims of honour related abuse, ""but a lot of victims will not want to report these matters to police"". ""It's their parents of family members who might be responsible for that abuse and they [victims] should feel absolutely no guilt in coming forward,"" she said. Elaine Radway, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and applauded the ""brave testimony"" of the victim.

The North has said it may cancel the summit if the US insists on it giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally. Mr Trump did not say what conditions the US had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North's arsenal, he said ""denuclearisation must take place"". Trump-Kim 'peace talks' coin criticised North Korea crisis in 300 words The 12 June summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in April. Meanwhile, North Korea has agreed to let in journalists from the South to watch the dismantling of its nuclear test site. The group, who had earlier been denied visas, will join a team of international media who are in the country to visit Punggye-ri over the next few days. The demolition of the site has been billed as a goodwill gesture but may be delayed by bad weather. Mr Trump told reporters: ""We'll see what happens. ""There are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't we don't have the meeting. ""You go into deals that are 100% certain - it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance and it happens and, sometimes, happens easily."" He also said Kim Jong-un's attitude had changed after his second visit to China, earlier this month. Shaking hands at the (fake) DMZ Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Later in the day, during a news conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo adopted a more positive position, saying the US was still working towards the 12 June date. He commended China for offering ""historic assistance"" in putting pressure on North Korea. Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington The optimistic build-up to the summit gave way to a reality check that was bound to happen sooner or later. With Kim Jong-un tapping the brakes and refusing to accept ""unilateral demands"" to disarm, President Trump also took a step back. He set his own conditions, although he didn't say what they were. He did stress that it would be worth it for the North Korean leader to risk denuclearisation, throwing the ball back into Mr Kim's court. The build-up to the summit has been shaped by an unusual degree of public showmanship by both leaders, a diplomatic version of their hostile exchanges last year. But while the threats and insults worked at the rhetorical level, this is about substantive issues where the detail matters. President Moon Jae-in also has his spin. He really wants to seize this opportunity for South Korea's sake and continues to be determined in his optimism, leaving some here wondering whether he's been overstating Kim Jong-un's willingness to deal. North Korea cancelled high-level talks with South Korea, saying the South's joint military exercises with the US - which it had previously said it would tolerate - were a ""provocation"". This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Pyongyang then accused US national security adviser John Bolton of making ""reckless statements"" for hissuggestion that the North could follow a ""Libya model"" of denuclearisation. That was a reference to Libya's former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003 and was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Mr Trump later denied the US would follow the ""Libyan model"" if an agreement was reached with North Korea. ""That model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. It would be historic as no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Mr Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for direct talks after more than a year of heated rhetoric and with global concern that hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr Trump was asking aides and advisers whether the meeting should go ahead. North Korea conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and developed long-distance missiles which, it says, can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland. Many observers had argued before Mr Trump met Mr Moon that there was too much at stake for Washington and Pyongyang not to proceed with the Singapore summit. However, Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. A group of Western, Russian and Chinese journalists have been invited by the North to its remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site ahead of its demolition. They were flown into the North Korean port city of Wonsan but their onward journey was postponed by bad weather, Tom Cheshire from the UK's Sky News tweets. Allow Twitter content?

Mother forced teen daughter to marryThe girl became pregnant at 13 by a relative 16 years her senior whom she was later forced to marry.7m7 minutes agoBirmingham & Black Country,"A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been convicted in the first successful prosecution in England. The woman duped the then 17-year-old into travelling to Pakistan to wed the man, who was 16 years her senior. Years before the ceremony, the girl was entered into a ""marriage contract"" with the man and became pregnant aged 13. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage. Midlands Live: Murder arrest after fatal shooting; Lucky escape as lorry rolls on to car in bridge crash The court heard the girl had an abortion upon her return to the UK, with her GP reporting his concerns to social services. Prosecutors said her mother ""made all the right noises"" to suggest her daughter and the man were just ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"" after she was referred. As she approached her 18th birthday, the girl was tricked into travelling to Pakistan again under the pretence of a family holiday. Once there, the court was told, the girl, then aged 18, sobbed as her mother forced her to sign marriage papers in September 2016. Giving evidence during the trial, she recalled crying as her mother led her by the arm to meet her husband-to-be. ""I didn't want to get married to him,"" she said. When the daughter protested against the marriage, jurors heard, her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. Manchester attack: Remembering the victims Fireworks factory owner guilty of fire deaths Voter ID: Hundreds turned away from voting The girl ""has been let down badly by her mother, whose love and attention she craves,"" prosecutor Deborah Gould said. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked shocked as she was convicted of forced marriage and of deceiving the victim to go to Pakistan in order to enter into a false marriage. She was also convicted of perjury, after she lied about the incident in the High Court. The mother was cleared of a fourth charge of perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced on Wednesday. It is the first time a forced marriage case of this kind has been successfully prosecuted in an English court. Prosecutions for forced marriage, which became an offence in 2014, are rare. In 2015, a man was jailed for offences including forced marriageat Merthyr Crown Court in Wales, and there is currently at least one live case on-going. Supt Sally Holmes from West Midlands Police said up to 300 calls a month about forced marriage and honour-based abuse are reported by Karma Nirvana, an organisation supporting victims of honour related abuse, ""but a lot of victims will not want to report these matters to police"". ""It's their parents of family members who might be responsible for that abuse and they [victims] should feel absolutely no guilt in coming forward,"" she said. Elaine Radway, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and applauded the ""brave testimony"" of the victim.

Elon Musk to fix Tesla 'braking flaw'Flaws pointed out in a review of Tesla's Model 3 have prompted Elon Musk to make changes.,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has admitted there is a braking issue in its Model 3 cars but promised a firmware update to fix it ""in the next few days"". The problems were flagged up ina review of the electric car,externalby US website Consumer Reports. ""Our testers found flaws - big flaws - such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls,"" wrote Patrick Olsen. Tesla had at first disputed the findings. The reviewer said braking distances on average were 152ft (46m), adding that that ""was far worse than any contemporary car we've tested"". In response, Tesla released a statement which read: ""Tesla's own testing has found braking distances with an average of 133ft when conducting the 60-0 mph stops using the 18"" Michelin all season tyre and as low as 126ft with all tyres currently available."" But later Mr Musk tweeted that the issue would be dealt with before the end of the week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tesla's long-awaited successor to its Model S has had more than 400,000 pre-orders, making it one of the most anticipated mass-production vehicles ever. The electric car comes with a starting price tag of $35,000 (Â£29,600) and has been described by Mr Musk as affordable for the mass market. It has faced repeated production and manufacturing delays and when deliveries started in July, it was for a more expensive version that included a long-range battery package which cost an extra $9,000. Recently Mr Musk unveiled specifications for a faster and more powerful version of the Model 3 which will cost $78,000, which does not include the Autopilot driver-assist feature. Consumer Reports stopped short of recommending the Model 3, despite describing it as an ""impressive performance sedan"". It also criticised over-reliance on touch-screen controls for everything from adjusting the mirrors to changing the direction of airflow, saying this could cause ""driver distraction"". Previously another review from Car and Driver noted that there was ""a bizarre amount of variation"" in the car's emergency stopping distance. The news comes as a driver was killed in a Tesla Model S, which veered off the road into a pond. It is not yet clear whether the car's Autopilot mode was in use during the accident, which happened near the city of San Ramon in California on Sunday evening. The semi-autonomous Autopilot can brake, accelerate and steer by itself under certain conditions but is not intended to operate independently and the driver is meant to have their hands on the wheel at all times. The driver was identified as 34-year-old Keith Leung. In March, a Model X car involved in a fatal crash in California was revealed to have been in Autopilot mode at the time.

'Living fossil' heading for extinction,"Jing Che of the Chinese Academy of Sciences lifts a giant salamander The world's largest amphibian is in ""catastrophic"" decline, with possibly only a handful left in the wild. Field surveys carried out over four years suggest the Chinese giant salamander has all but disappeared from its natural habitat. In contrast, millions of the animals live in commercial farms, where they are sold to luxury restaurants. Remaining largely unchanged for 170 million years, this ""living fossil"" is seen as a global conservation priority. ""The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time-span,"" said study researcher Dr Samuel Turvey of the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). ""Unless co-ordinated conservation measures are put in place as a matter of urgency, the future of the world's largest amphibian is in serious jeopardy."" The giant salamander, which lives in freshwater rivers, was once common across China. Eating the creature was historically seen as taboo, but, in a reversal of fortunes, the giant salamander is now regarded as a delicacy, despite its status as an endangered species. It is illegal to harvest wild giant salamanders, but commercial breeding farms are booming. The largest can fetch upwards of RMB 10,000 (US $1,500). The amphibian can grow up to 1.8m long Field surveys were carried out at 97 different sites in 16 of the country's 23 provinces in what is thought to be the largest wildlife survey carried out in China to date. Giant salamanders were found in wild conditions at four sites, but genetic analysis suggested they were not native to the local environment and had probably been released from commercial breeding farms. It is illegal to harvest wild populations of giant salamander in China, but the country's Ministry of Agriculture supports widespread release of farmed animals as a conservation measure. It appears this may be doing more harm than good. Researchers have just learned that giant salamanders aren't one species, but five, and possibly as many as eight. Scientists from the Kunming Institute carry out a survey Releasing the amphibians back into the wild without taking these genetic differences into account may be putting their future at even greater risk. ""Together with addressing wider pressures such as poaching for commercial farms and habitat loss, it's essential that suitable safeguards are put in place to protect the unique genetic lineage of these amazing animals, which dates back to the time of the dinosaurs,"" said co-researcher Dr Fang Yan from the Kunming Institute of Zoology. Dr Jing Che of the Chinese Academy of Sciences added: ""Conservation strategies for the Chinese giant salamander require urgent updating."" The giant salamander is listed as ""critically endangered"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and is a protected species in China. It holds a special place in Chinese culture and is sometimes called ""wa wa yu"", or ""baby fish"", in Chinese because its distress call resembles the cry of a baby. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

Grenfell victims' aunt 'plagued' by fire,"Six members of the Choucair family spanning three generations died Families of those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire left an inquiry in tears after a video of the blaze was shown without a warning. One woman was said to have collapsed outside the hearing after seeing the video, which included footage filmed from inside the burning building. An inquiry official apologised, saying a warning system had failed. The second day has been dedicated to commemorations of those killed, including six members of one family. A nephew of one of the 72 victims said the bereaved wanted ""the truth"" and ""those in power"" must ""listen to our stories and learn from your mistakes."" Karim Mussily, whose uncle Hesham Rahman lived on the 23rd floor, earned a standing ovation from other relatives in the room when he told the inquiry: ""We've been censored enough, it's our time; whether you like it or not, you have to listen."" Tributes were paid to Hesham Rahman including by his sister Noha A video about the Choucair family started with clips of the fire in which people could be seen at windows surrounded by flames and screams could be heard. Between 20 and 30 people left the room and wails could be heard outside. The BBC's Emma Harrison said some were in extreme states of distress. The inquiry at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel, South Kensington, paused while the person who collapsed received medical treatment. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 2 What happened at the tower block? Bernard Richmond QC, who is leading the presentations by bereaved family members, said he was sorry a warning had not been read out before the film was shown. He said it had been a busy day and a system the inquiry had put in place for warning of troubling material had failed before this particular video was shown. When the hearing resumed, Mr Mussily said on a previous visit to his uncle the lift had been broken and the single staircase was narrow. He said: ""I couldn't help but think how on earth would my uncle escape if there was a fire."" Mierna, Fatima and Zainab Choukair died along with their grandmother and parents Hisam Choucair, who lost his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nieces in the blaze on 14 June 2017, had earlier told the inquiry how he could only watch helplessly as they died. Mr Choucair said the deaths of his mother Sirria, 60, sister Nadia, 30, her husband Bassem Choukair, 40, and their daughters Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and three-year-old Zainab was an ""atrocity"". He said he had ""always had a bad feeling"" about the building. Mr Choucair said when he got to the scene the building was ""completely engulfed in flames"" and he simply had to ""stand there for hours watching them all burn to death"". He said his mother, who arrived from Lebanon as a teenager in the 1970s, was ""loving, kind and patient"" while his sister and her husband, who lived two doors away from her in the block, were very popular and hard-working. He said his eldest niece, Mierna, had an ""excellent sense of humour"", loved sport, music and school and wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer. Bassem Choukair and his wife Nadia were very popular, the inquiry was told His sister Sawsam, who lived with their mother in the tower, also spoke of her grief. She said she managed to speak to Bassem on the phone during the fire, adding: ""His first thoughts were to reassure me. ""He told me everything was alright, even though he was trapped with my family in a burning building."" ByBBC reporter Emma Harrison Laughter fills the room during lighter moments of the tributes, as family members recall funny stories or traits of their loved ones. But the tears continue to flow as those reading emotional tributes struggle to maintain composure throughout their statements. The support and empathy towards those talking is strong, and the audience shows appreciation for their bravery with applause. As the first day had already witnessed, the common theme so far is how incomprehensible their deaths were and the need, as one family member put it, ""to find out the truth"". This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The second day of the inquiry also heard from the husband of Maria Del Pilar Burton, who is regarded as the final of the 72 victims. Mrs Burton, 74, who had dementia, died in January after her health deteriorated following the fire. In an emotional tribute, Nicholas Burton said it took away her ""dignity and everything we had in this world"". Maria Del Pilar Burton died in hospital in January Mrs Burton, known as Pily, was born in Spain in the 1940s and was one was one of the very first residents in Grenfell Tower. Mr Burton, who was with his wife for 34 years, told the inquiry she was an ""extraordinary woman"". He said: ""She was a unique, beautiful, exceptional person until this tragedy had taken it away."" Also commemorated were Rania Ibrahim, 30, and her daughters Fathia, five, and Hania, three, who lived on the 23rd floor of the building. Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fathia, known as Fou-Fou, and Hania, lived on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower Rasha Ibrahim said her sister moved to the UK from Egypt in 2009 but the pair remained very close. In a statement read to the inquiry by an interpreter, Mrs Ibrahim said: ""It is so important for me to understand how I have lost my beloved sister while my children have lost their little cousins."" Debbie Lamprell was 45 years old A tribute to Debbie Lamprell, a safety officer at Opera Holland Park, from her mother said the 45-year-old was ""always laughing"". Miriam Lamprell said she was ""bereft"" without her daughter and she felt a part of her had been ""ripped out"". A memorial stone has been placed at Opera Holland Park, where Debbie Lamprell worked Relatives of all 72 victims will be given the chance to commemorate loved ones during the inquiry, which will look into all the deaths. Families are being given as long as they need to tell the inquiry about their loved ones through a mixture of words, pictures and videos. A minute's silence was held at the start of the afternoon session to respectthe anniversary of the Manchester terrorist attack. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell: Unpacking our old life.

Tesco removing some 'best before' dates,"Tesco is removing ""best before"" labels from many of its fresh produce lines, which it says will help reduce waste. The supermarket will remove the advice from about 70 pre-packaged produce lines to avoid ""perfectly edible food"" being thrown away. The items that will lose the label include apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons, other citrus fruit and onions. ""Best before"" labels indicate that the quality of a product may deteriorate after the date indicated. In contrast ""use by"" dates indicate when it becomes less safe to consume the food. ""We know some customers may be confused by the difference between 'best before' and 'use by' dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded,"" said Mark Little, Tesco's head of food waste. He said fruit and vegetables were among the food most frequently thrown away by consumers, although many are ignoring ""best before"" dates already. ""Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the 'best before' date code on the packaging,"" he added. Stopping the rot: Meet the waste warriors Watch: Turning bread into beer to fight food waste Use By- Cannot be sold, redistributed or consumed after this date. Applied to foods which are highly perishable - such as fresh fish, meat and poultry - and therefore constitute an immediate danger to human health Best Before- Can be sold, redistributed and consumed after this date. Applied to all other kinds of food Some products aren't legally required to carry a date label Only one date label is recommended for each food item Source: Wrap Tesco said removing the information on the label would encourage customers to make their own decisions about the freshness of produce. However, all the produce affected will be items sold in bags or boxes and so are less easy to handle. Individual items, such as loose lemons or onions, already do not carry ""best before"" labels. The supermarket said that although customers would no longer be able to differentiate between bags of produce to determine how fresh they were at purchase, there were ""rigorous stock rotation procedures in place"" to ensure older items did not remain on shelves. Advice issued,externaljointly last year by anti-waste campaign group Wrap, the Food Standards Agency and the Department for the Environment suggested fewer foods should be labelled with ""use by"" dates, including pasteurised fruit drinks and hard cheese. Greater use of ""best before"" dates should be encouraged, they suggested. But a recent survey by the National Federation of Women's Institutes found that less than half of respondents understood what ""best before"" means. However, more than 70% had a clear understanding of ""use by"" labels. Last year, the East of England Co-op, which is separate from the national Co-operative chain,began selling dried and tinned products that were beyond their ""best before"" datesat knock-down prices. Justine Roberts, founder of parenting website Mumsnet, said: ""Mumsnet users are keen not to waste food or, just as importantly, money. ""When it comes to 'best before' dates, most parents on Mumsnet take very little notice. Sad-looking veg often ends up in the slow cooker, leftover portions are put in the freezer for pot-luck nights, bread gets grated for breadcrumbs.""

New rules to protect police chase drivers,"This video can not be played Stories of moped crime from victims and police Police drivers will have more legal protection if they are involved in a crash, in a bid to tackle criminals on mopeds, as part of Home Office plans. New proposals aim to smash the ""myth"" that officers cannot pursue riders who are not wearing helmets. ""Criminals must not think they can get away with a crime by riding or driving in a certain way,"" policing minister Nick Hurd said. The Police Federation, which has called for the changes, welcomed the reforms. But the federation's roads policing lead Tim Rogers urged government to ""act quickly to prevent more officers suffering unnecessary and often mendacious prosecutions"". The reforms - which would affect forces in England and Wales - follow concerns among officers that they risk prosecution for careless or dangerous driving if they chase criminals at high speed, particularly those on mopeds and motorcycles. Moped crime: 'Change in law intended' Moped crime up 30 times in five years Under current rules, any motorist - including police officers - who fails to drive in a ""competent and careful"" manner can be prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving.

Or select from           Since 2012, by far the most common type of crime has been theft and handling with 30,387 offences - around three quarters of the total:  If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhereto reload the page. The Police Federation argues this deters some officers from pursuing suspects - because they are worried they will be investigated and charged if they have to break the speed limit, jump red lights or drive on the wrong side of the road. The overhaul of the law follows a surge in crimes involving scooters and motorbikes in the last three years,particularly in London. Common moped crimes include snatching phones, but some people have been slashed with knives and weapons by drivers too. By BBC Reality Check There's no specific rule which forces the police from calling off a pursuit. Instead it's up to police forces to issue guidance to officers. The Home Office consultation says ""we have seen how criminals' perception of well-intentioned local guidance around pursuing motorcycle riders not wearing crash helmets has contributed to an increase in motorcycle-related crime, particularly in London"". The Metropolitan Police said that if a suspect removes their helmet they can still pursue, while ""taking advice from the pursuit tactical adviser"". Joy Merriam, a solicitor advocate, told Reality Check it comes down to a value judgement: ""If the police pursue someone who is not wearing a helmet they have to weigh up the risk of the suspect getting injured. Officers have to consider things like: how built up the area is, whether the speed is appropriate to the conditions and the risk to pedestrians."" Under the government's proposals, published on the first day of the annual conference of the Police Federation, rules would be changed to take into account police drivers' high level of training. Police would instead be subject to a separate test requiring an officer to drive in a way that is necessary and proportionate to the circumstances. ""Our proposed changes will make sure that skilled police drivers who follow their rigorous training are protected, while ensuring the minority of officers who do cross the line are robustly held to account,"" Policing Minister Nick Hurd said. The rules will also make clear that a moped or motorcycle rider who does not wear a helmet is responsible for their own decision to drive dangerously. In 2016-17 there were about 10,000 police pursuits and 500,000 blue-light responses in England and Wales.

Air pollution plans to tackle wood burners,"Plans to tackle sources of air pollution - such as wood-burning stoves - put too much responsibility on local councils, critics say. The government, as part of its clean air strategy, wants to clamp down on all sources of pollution, including coal-burning and ammonia from farms. Campaigners welcome the consultation, but say it does not go far enough. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it would be ""disproportionate"" to have a uniform ban on certain fuels. He said the air pollution effects in rural areas of fuels, such as diesel or coal, are significantly less compared to urban areas as they are dispersed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: ""What we've got here are a series of proportionate measures which we hope will deal with what is a big public health issue."" UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed UK faces European court over dirty air Ministers want to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of pollution from fine particles, known as particulates, by 2025. One of the most contentious proposals is to reduce pollution from wood burners, which, along with solid fuels, cause 38% of particulate pollution. But a source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC there was no plan to ban existing stoves - or the burning of coal and open wood fires, which are far more polluting than wood burners. Sorry, your browser does not support this tool Source: MappAir100 by EarthSense If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhere,externalto reload the page. Farmers, who have largely evaded pollution controls so far, will be told to buy new equipment to reduce airborne ammonia from slurry. The government has been obliged to publish this Clean Air Strategy under an EU rule. It's in addition to the law which has seen the UK taken to court over high levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution. The new legislation would not ban existing wood-burning stoves. However, any new stoves that are sold would have to be cleaner People would be encouraged to burn dry seasoned wood, which emits fewer particulates than wet wood Councils would be given new powers, such as limiting what people can burn or introducing ""no-burn days"" But there is not expected to be a ban on the sale of wet wood, which typically come from garage forecourts Ministers estimate that their plans will reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated Â£1 billion every year by 2020, rising to Â£2.5 billion every year from 2030. They describe air pollution as the fourth biggest threat to public health after cancer, obesity and heart disease. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains - air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment. ""This clean air strategy sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of the government to improve air quality."" All EU nations will have to submit similar plans to cut pollution but Mr Gove says the UK's policies will be carried out beyond Brexit. This video can not be played Michael Gove told Today ""conventional cars"" will be banned by 2040 The legislation will give new powers to local councils so they can solve pollution hotspots. Some councils welcome this approach whilst others think they're being left to do the government's dirty work. Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association said: ""If we're to truly tackle air pollution, we need government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission vehicles and power generation."" Green groups are pleased that the plan will be embedded in new primary legislation - and they applaud the decision to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of particulates. But they say the document so far doesn't say how the government will deal with the on-going problem of NOX emissions from cars. And they accuse it of loading too much work on to local councils. Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""The ambition is impressive - but how is it going to be achieved? Lots of councils simply don't have the resources to deal with these issues."" He said the proposal on wood burners was far too vague: ""Will hard-pressed environmental health officers really be checking on wet wood in forecourts?"" he asked. Sue Hayman MP, Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, said: ""Michael Gove has become the Secretary of State for Consultations - with over 25 consultations published by his department since the General Election and not a single piece of primary legislation brought forward."" Farmers will be supported to cut ammonia emissions through the proposednew farming funding system known as public money for public goods. One technologically-difficult issue is also acknowledged - the contribution to microplastic air pollution and water pollution from vehicle brakes and tyres wearing on the road. The government says it will work with international partners to research and develop new standards. Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Do you have any questions about tackling air pollution?

Epic offers $100m Fortnite prize fund,"Epic Games is offering $100m prize fund for Fortnite players Publisher Epic Games has announced that it will be offering a prize pot of $100m (Â£74m) for Fortnite competitions. The prize fund has been set aside for the first year of competitive play of the popular game due to start later this year. It is believed to be the biggest sum of money offered for an e-sports tournament. Epic made the announcement in ablog post.,external It said: ""Fortnite Competitors! Grab your gear, drop in and start training. Since the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale we've watched the passion for community competition grow and can't wait to empower you to battle with the best. ""In the 2018-19 season, Epic Games will provide $100m to fund prize pools for Fortnite competitions. We're getting behind competitive play in a big way, but our approach will be different - we plan to be more inclusive, and focused on the joy of playing and watching the game."" Fortnite is a survival shooting game that lets players build structures out of materials they scavenge from the game world. No further details have been revealed at this stage but games industry experts believe the announcement is a smart marketing move by Epic. ""It is quite an impressive headline figure, but there is no detail on how the money is going to be divided, whether there will be a traditional tournament and a world champion player or lots of smaller tournaments."" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games research at IHS Markit. ""China's Tencent, who own part of Epic, have said that they plan to launch Fortnite in China, so, in effect, this is a very large marketing budget. ""Launching the game into a competitive e-sports market like China means that it is less of a gamble than the headline suggests,"" added Mr Harding-Rolls. He added that the game has not yet been established as an e-sports game so this would be a good way to try to ""establish itself as a major e-sports proposition"". E-sports is organised, competitive computer gaming and can be staged in front of a live audience and watched by millions more people online. Fortnite first was launched in June 2017. Its most popular format is the Battle Royale mode, launched in September of that year, which pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free but players can spend real money on in-app purchases including skins to customise player avatars.

Blair 'did not know' about Belhaj case,"This video can not be played Tony Blair says he will ""go along"" with government apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj Tony Blair says he was not made aware of the abduction of Libyan dissident Abdul Hakim Belhaj until after he had left office in 2007. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised to Mr Belhaj, who in 2004 was seized by the CIA and sent to Libya with the assistance of MI6. Mr Belhaj says he was tortured by Col Muammar Gaddafi's forces.

Abdul Hakim Belhaj says he was tortured by his Libyan jailers Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I have gone along with what the government has done, which is to issue an apology.

Belarus slams UK embassy over rainbow flag,"A video of the flag was posted on the embassy's Instagram account Belarus has slammed the UK embassy in Minsk for flying a rainbow flag on the International Day Against Homophobia, calling LGBT relationships ""fake"". In a lengthy statement, the Interior Ministry said the UK was challenging the country's ""traditional values"". ""The LGBT community, and all this fight for 'their rights', and the very day of the community are just a fake!"" A spokeswoman for the embassy said it would not comment. Homosexuality is not illegal in Belarus but it is a taboo. Marriage between same-sex people is not recognised and activists say the government has intensified a crackdown on the LGBT community. The secret executions in Europe's 'last dictatorship' Belarus country profile Often described as Europe's ""last dictatorship"", Belarus has been ruled with an iron fist by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. In 2012,he famously declared it was ""better to be a dictator than gay""after complaints of human rights abuses in the country. In the statement issued on Sunday, the government accused the UK of creating ""problems where they do not exist"", saying the day against homophobia, celebrated on 17 May, had never been significant in the country. ""The reason for this is obvious - the overwhelming majority of Belarusians stick to traditional family values, including Christian ones. And such statements are a challenge to these values."" Relationships between men and women were the ""only way of reproduction"", it added. ""No matter which way you look at it but a same-sex relationship is a fake. And the essence of the fake is always the same - the erosion of the truth."" The embassy posted a video of the flag on its Instagram account, using the hashtag #Idahobit, which stands for International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia.

Elon Musk admits Tesla braking flaw,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has admitted there is a braking issue in its Model 3 cars but promised a firmware update to fix it ""in the next few days"". The problems were flagged up ina review of the electric car,externalby US website Consumer Reports.

The reviewer said braking distances on average were 152ft (46m), adding that that ""was far worse than any contemporary car we've tested"". In response, Tesla released a statement which read: ""Tesla's own testing has found braking distances with an average of 133ft when conducting the 60-0 mph stops using the 18"" Michelin all season tyre and as low as 126ft with all tyres currently available.""

Tesla's long-awaited successor to its Model S has had more than 400,000 pre-orders, making it one of the most anticipated mass-production vehicles ever. The electric car comes with a starting price tag of $35,000 (Â£29,600) and has been described by Mr Musk as affordable for the mass market. It has faced repeated production and manufacturing delays and when deliveries started in July, it was for a more expensive version that included a long-range battery package which cost an extra $9,000. Recently Mr Musk unveiled specifications for a faster and more powerful version of the Model 3 which will cost $78,000, which does not include the Autopilot driver-assist feature. Consumer Reports stopped short of recommending the Model 3, despite describing it as an ""impressive performance sedan"". It also criticised over-reliance on touch-screen controls for everything from adjusting the mirrors to changing the direction of airflow, saying this could cause ""driver distraction"". Previously another review from Car and Driver noted that there was ""a bizarre amount of variation"" in the car's emergency stopping distance. The news comes as a driver was killed in a Tesla Model S, which veered off the road into a pond. It is not yet clear whether the car's Autopilot mode was in use during the accident, which happened near the city of San Ramon in California on Sunday evening. The semi-autonomous Autopilot can brake, accelerate and steer by itself under certain conditions but is not intended to operate independently and the driver is meant to have their hands on the wheel at all times. The driver was identified as 34-year-old Keith Leung. In March, a Model X car involved in a fatal crash in California was revealed to have been in Autopilot mode at the time.

'I must've died 200 times in my nightmares',"Manchester is marking the first anniversary of the arena bombing. The survivors of the atrocity, in which 22 people died, explain how they have coped and how they are approaching the milestone. Daren Buckley helped treat and comfort the wounded and dying ForDaren Buckley, life changed forever when 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device. The 50-year-old had been about to leave the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena when the blast almost knocked him and his son off their feet. The pair had been standing only nine metres (30ft) from the bomber, and Mr Buckley struggles to describe the ""complete chaos"" of the moments that followed, which were filled with screams and confusion. Yet the father of four's first instinct was not to flee, but to run to help the wounded - ripping up piles of souvenir Ariana Grande T-shirts to be used as bandages. He said: ""We saw a big puff of smoke and a flash. It knocked us back. We thought the building was about to collapse. I couldn't hear anything - it was like water was in my ears. ""I took my son to a safe place with another chap and said to him to stay there, that I had to go and help. ""That's when the screaming started. The scenes in the foyer I can't describe. It was like a nightmare. I thought someone was going to tap me on my shoulder and say it was a dream."" Thousands attended a vigil in Manchester's Albert Square following the bombing Mr Buckley, who has basic first aid training, joined a handful of arena staff who initially tended to the injured and dying. He continued: ""I looked around on the floor. Some people were moving, some weren't. I was talking to people who seemed alright, just trying to reassure them. It was just an instinct, which is human."" The emergency services soon arrived, before armed police declared the area a crime scene, and Mr Buckley and his son were moved away. A year later, the married pub cellar man remains traumatised. Manchester remembers arena bomb victims Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Attack 'could have been stopped' Mr Buckley, from Swinton, has only recently felt able to return to Manchester city centre, but he plans to go to the service at the city's cathedral. He said he'd found comfort in joining the Manchester Survivors Choir, which will be performing at Tuesday'ssing-along event in Albert Square, but that his recovery was far from complete. ""If I hear sirens I'm thinking 'do I have to go and help someone else?' - I feel like I'm still in adrenaline mode,"" he said. ""It's strange because I never used to have fear over anything. I have flashbacks. ""I must've died 200 times in my nightmares."" Lyndsay Turner and her son Ciaran Danson say it has been a struggle to get help WhenLyndsay Turnerbought her two children tickets to the concert she wanted to make sure it was a special evening and hired a limo. She had originally planned to go with them but was awaiting surgery so gave the ticket to her sister-in-law, who attended with Lyndsay's mother. However, she kept in touch with her family throughout the night, and was on the phone to her sonCiaran Danson, now 14, when the explosion happened. ""I heard the bang and I said 'Ciaran, what's that?' and I could hear panic in his voice and then the phone went dead."" It wasn't until 45 minutes later that her mother was able to ring. ""The fact that I bought the tickets, I put them in danger, it'll always live with me,"" she said. Ciaran still hopes to follow in his hero's footsteps and become a singer one day Both children were left with severe post-traumatic stress. Tegan, now 12, spent some time in hospital and Ciaran is still struggling. He has flashbacks, has been unable to sleep and experiences ""very scary"" hallucinations of the attacker, he said. ""It was just a blur at first but now he's as real as you or me."" Ms Turner, from Blackpool, says ""a part of her children died that night"" and Ciaran also says he has changed. The teenager said: ""Before that I was very bubbly and happy, I was always singing and acting and now I feel depressed, I just don't want to go out of the house."" He said he had struggled to get mental health support and felt ""forgotten"". ""I had counselling for six weeks. It helped a bit, but not much and then after that I got left. ""I've just been waiting for referral after referral with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. I've only just been seen now. "" Armed police stand guard near ambulances on the night of the bombing One of the hardest things for Ciaran has been bullying, which has resulted in him being taken out of school by his social worker. He will be attending a non-mainstream school over the next few months. Ms Turner said children have made ""flippant"" and ""disgusting"" comments, highlighting one incident in particular. ""An Asian child had started at the school and some pupils thought it would be funny to say 'she's here to blow you up',"" she said. ""It's disgusting the society we live in where children are thinking like that."" Ciaran is set to start counselling this week and is hoping it will help him. He also wants to be able to go back to the arena as he hopes to follow in his idol's footsteps and become a singer. Ms Turner believes finding help has been harder because the family don't live in Manchester. ""There are a lot of people affected all over the UK, probably outside of the UK. It shouldn't just be centred around Manchester; you have to cater for everybody. ""I can't even see him smile. All I want to do is see him smile again."" Dr Alistair Rennie coordinated the response to the bombing at two hospitals Emergency medicine consultantAlistair Rennieco-ordinated the response to the attack at Manchester Royal Infirmary and the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. After declaring a major incident, he worked for 24 hours without sleep, managing surgeons, liaising with the police and ambulance service. Dr Rennie, who describes his role as ""managing the shop floor"", said he was left deeply saddened by the deaths of three of the victims at the two hospitals. He said: ""We all train for this, and you can imagine having a bad bus crash or a train crash to deal with. On this occasion, what was even more emotive was that this had been planned. ""That was an emotional issue to deal with. You are treating people who have been targeted."" Dozens of staff answered the call to come into the hospitals, with some getting to work despite fearing for the safety of friends or loved ones at the arena. Dr Rennie said they were faced with what were effectively ""warzone"" injuries and, across Greater Manchester, 23 operating theatres worked through the night. With thoughts now turning to Tuesday's anniversary, Dr Rennie said it had remained ""very difficult"" for some staff to come to terms with the bombing. ""We are all human. Some have been quite badly affected, particularly some of those who dealt with children,"" he said. Twenty-two people were killed in the blast on 22 May Returning home to his young children, Dr Rennie said he was left ""fully aware"" of the loss and grief families had suffered. ""It was one of those moments of thinking 'my God, what are other people going through?'"" The hospitals will observe a minute's silence on Tuesday. At the children's hospital, this will be broken by singing from the Manchester Survivors Choir - something Dr Rennie fears could ""tip me into a crying, bubbling wreck"". However, he said the pressures of work would mean there won't be much time to spend in reflection. ""Life is very short,"" he said. ""We've got to live the best life we can for everyone."" Mark Robinson was photographed as he was helped from the area Mark Robinsontravelled to the concert from Leeds with his partner Eli and her two daughters. He was standing with Eli in the foyer about seven metres (23ft) away from Abedi at the time of the blast, and suffered shrapnel wounds and a perforated eardrum. ""The actual explosion, your brain cannot process fast enough what's gone on. You think you're in a dream, you're certainly not trained for what you see,"" he said. ""How can I describe the last year? It's like being at the edge of a pond with ripples keep coming towards you. The flashbacks that you have. ""I feel guilt for taking Eli and her girls there. Why was it that concert?"" Although he has recovered from his physical injuries, he said he was still affected by what happened that night. ""It doesn't stop overnight because your wounds heal,"" he explained, mentioning the regular blood tests to check for HIV and hepatitis he continues to undergo. However, he credits going back to work as something that has helped him. Manchester's St Ann's Square became a focal point for tributes following the attack ""My colleagues, the company I work for, they were absolutely fantastic and it's so humbling,"" he said. ""Life is so precious and it can be taken away in an instant. ""Walking the dog, listening to birdsong, rain on your face. Simple things that you appreciate. ""I am so so grateful that I have got my legs and arms and I was able to go back to work and carry on."" Mr Robinson and his partner will be attending the service at Manchester Cathedral. He said he was glad Prince William and Theresa May would be in attendance as it ""shows it's not forgotten in higher circles"". ""It's important to go and hopefully see the people who helped you. And to remember those who didn't make it."" Janet Sherret says her most important job is to get her daughter's sparkle back Janet Sherrettravelled to the gig with her daughterKaela, then aged 12. Mrs Sherret, from Fife, has since joined an online support group for survivors of the bombing. ""Living in Scotland, we felt kind of left out of it because obviously there was the Manchester Resilience Hub support group,"" she said. The past year has been ""like a recovery from everything"", Mrs Sherret says, and the emotional impact will ""remain there forever"". ""It puts a different slant on anywhere you go where there's a big crowd because you're on high alert. ""This is why it's the loss of innocence for my daughter. She never used to think like that and was her carefree self."" Manchester was awash with tributes following the attack Mrs Sherret has been left with separation anxiety when her daughter is not with her. ""I thought I was having to protect her with my life,"" she said. ""It's not something you come across every day."" She, too, has experienced feelings of guilt. ""You have this guilt that you took your child to something that you thought would be safe, as well as a survivor's guilt."" The mother and daughter plan to mark the anniversary with a simple ""girlie day"". ""I'm going to keep her off school and we'll sit and watch films. ""My most important job is to get my daughter's sparkle back.""

How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts,"Ed Sheeran has taken an aggressive stance against touts by cancelling more than 10,000 tickets for his upcoming stadium tour. After the tour went on sale, the star's team identified purchases by known touts and revoked their tickets. Any tickets listed for re-sale on sites like Viagogo were also cancelled. Fans who'd bought from those sites - often at vastly inflated prices - were given assistance in claiming refunds and getting genuine tickets. So far, more than Â£240,000 has been returned to fans who inadvertently bought invalid tickets. ""We're achieving exactly what Ed wanted, which is 'we want you to come in and pay this [fixed] price,'"" said Stuart Galbraith of concert promoters Kilimanjaro Live. A further 500 tickets are going to be cancelled this week, ahead of Sheeran's first night at Manchester's Etihad Stadium, he added. Allow YouTube content?

Sheeran's team decided to pursue touts after hundreds of tickets for a Teenage Cancer Trust gig were snapped up and sold for profit last March. He imposed strict conditions on his 18-date stadium tour, including: Names printed on tickets, with ID required at the door A maximum of four tickets per customer Tickets listed for resale to be cancelled Any tickets bought by a ""business or trader""  to be cancelled In addition, the on-sale date was a Saturday - rather than the traditional Friday - to make sure genuine fans had the greatest possible chance of being online. Sheeran also partnered withTwickets,external- a site which allows fans to swap tickets at face value or less, in order to protect fans from the ""unethical practices"" of touts. Galbraith negotiated with ticket resellers Get Me In, Seatwave and StubHub to make sure they wouldn't list tickets for the tour - in some cases, using the threat of prosecution under the Consumer Rights Act to reinforce his point. ""The only agency which listed against our wishes and ignored all our correspondence was Viagogo,"" said Galbraith. Once tickets had been sold, the promoters ""very laboriously"" went through all the transactions and ""identified known touts and multiple purchases"". Those tickets, and any listed on sites like Viagogo were immediately invalidated. The woman taking on Viagogo Ticket resellers 'misleading' consumers ""We refunded everybody even though we know they're power sellers and touts, so we can't be accused of taking double income off a single ticket,"" said Galbraith. When the tour launches, anyone who turns up unaware their ticket has been cancelled will be met by a customer care team, he added. ""We'll have teams that say, 'your ticket is invalid' and it'll be stamped invalid. That's important because it will enable them to go back to Viagogo and claim a refund. ""What we'll also then do is... send them to the next window and sell them a ticket at face value."" Arctic Monkeys have also been battling touts on their upcoming UK tour He added: ""We genuinely hope we turn away as few people as possible. Because at the end of the day, even the people who've bought in the secondary market, as far as Ed is concerned, are still his [fans]."" At the time of writing, Viagogo was still offering tickets to the tour, with prices in excess of Â£400, compared to a face value of between Â£49 and Â£88. Sheeran's ticketing system is not a first - Glastonbury and the West End musical Hamilton operate similar policies - but no-one has attempted it for a large-scale tour before. It was conceived with the help of theFanFair Alliance,external, which lobbies against the ""black market"" in concert tickets, and has already been mimicked by the Arctic Monkeys for their upcoming UK tour. Their manager, Ian McAndrew, said he and the band had grown tired of fans being ""misled, confused and, I believe, fraudulently led to spend large sums of money on tickets, even when tickets are actually still available"" at face value. In total, the band sold 190,000 tickets with only a small percentage appearing on secondary resale sites. Again, only Viagogo refused a request not to list the tickets. The Swiss-based site iscurrently facing legal actionover its failure to comply with consumer protection laws. Asked for a response to this story, Viagogo directed the BBC to theFAQ section,externalof its website, where it protests against concert promoters who deny entry to fans using resold tickets. ""These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal,"" it says.

He also said there was ""no question"" that Mr Trump could walk away from the 12 June summit.

Danish minister prompts Ramadan rowInger Stojberg suggested Muslims should take time off work because of potential safety risks.,"Ms Stojberg argues that an 18-hour fast could affect safety in some jobs in Denmark Denmark's immigration minister has been widely rebuffed after she suggested Muslims should take time off work during Ramadan because of potential safety risks to the rest of society. Inger Stojberg, who has a reputation for hardline immigration policies, said fasting throughout the working day raised challenges for modern society. She cited potential risks for bus drivers and in hospitals. Bus companies were among the first to say they had no problem with Ramadan. Arriva, which runs a number of bus routes in Denmark, said it had never had any accidents involving drivers who were fasting. ""So de facto it's not a problem for us,"" spokeswoman Pia Hammershoy Splittorff told Berlingske Tidende (BT) newspaper. The same message came from Denmark's 3F transport union, whose leader Jan Villadsen wondered if the minister was trying to create a problem that did not yet exist. Denmark's Muslim Union posted a message on social media thanking Ms Stojberg for her concern, but pointed out that Muslims were adults who were perfectly capable of looking after themselves and society, ""even when we fast"". A party colleague of the minister, Jacob Jensen, suggested politicians should focus on solving ""real problems"" rather than interfering. What is Ramadan? Should children be allowed to fast? How to exercise, eat and sleep well during Ramadan Inger Stojberg wrote in an opinion piece for BT (in Danish),externalthat Denmark had religious freedom and religion was a private matter. But she suggested that Muslims who observed Ramadan in Denmark could not eat or drink for more than 18 hours. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, which can occur at 21:29 in Denmark in June. Ms Stojberg said the demands of modern-day Denmark required long working days, sometimes involving operating dangerous machines. She gave the example of bus drivers who had not drunk or eaten for over 10 hours and suggested that fasting could affect ""safety and productivity"". ""I want to call on Muslims to take leave from work during the month of Ramadan to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society,"" she said. Why are countries taking refugees' valuables? Danes to double penalty for ghetto crime Migrants yield little cash for Denmark The integration minister is a centre-right politician from the liberal Venstre party who has been instrumental in tightening Denmark's immigration policy. She wrote an article last month in which she suggested that a ""significant proportion of refugees"" cheat or abuse the trust of Danes. Since her party formed a coalition government in 2015, Denmark has imposed a string of immigration controls to the extent that last year she posted a picture of a cake marking the 50th such amendment.

Two years ago Denmark approved a controversial measure to confiscate the valuables of asylum seekers to pay for their board and lodging. After the act drew comparisons with the Nazis' seizure of valuables from Jews in World War Two, wedding and engagement rings were excluded from the law. Other measures include tightening requirements for learning Danish, tougher citizenship tests and financial independence. Denmark saw a spike in arrivals of asylum seekers and irregular migrants in 2015 but the numbers have fallen significantly. Figures published this month by Politiken newspaper suggest that the number of Muslims successfully applying for citizenship in Denmark has also gone down. In 2014 70% of new citizenships were awarded to people from predominantly Muslim countries, and that figure has since fallen to 21%.

'Illegal' adoption claims at Catholic homeA BBC investigation uncovers allegations of 'illegal' adoptions at a home run by Catholic nuns.12h12 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"As a baby, Karen Trimnell was issued with three birth certificates, including one with numerous false details A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of 'illegal' cross-border adoptions at a home run by Catholic nuns in Northern Ireland. Evidence suggests some children may have been moved out of the UK without their mothers' consent from Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry. One woman was issued with three birth certificates in three countries. The Catholic Good Shepherd Sisters said adoptions were ""conducted strictly in accordance with the legislation"". One of the three birth certificates issued as part of Karen Trimnell's adoption to the USA contained many false details. Karen Trimnell was born in Newry but was adopted and grew up in Texas The Marianvale mother and baby home in County Down operated between 1955 and 1984. It was one of a network of institutions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which offered women the voluntary option for those who were unmarried to give birth in private and give their babies up for adoption. However, BBC radio programme File on 4 has heard claims that some adoptions were not voluntary and uncovered evidence that laws may have been broken. These include falsified details on official documents. Campaigners claim this may have been to facilitate the illegal movement of babies across state borders. The former nuns' residence at the Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry, County Down Karen, 49, an English teacher in New York, was born in 1968. Her mother travelled to Marianvale and gave birth at a nearby hospital. Karen believes she was moved illegally from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland - where she was cared for by another Catholic order - before being adopted by a couple from Texas in the USA. Karen's concerns are based on a stash of documents charting her early life which she passed to File on 4. They revealed that she had been issued with a birth certificate in Northern Ireland which correctly recorded all the details of her birth. But two days earlier, another birth certificate had been generated for her in the Republic of Ireland containing false information, including changing her date and place of birth as well as listing her future adopted parents as her natural parents. It is not clear who was responsible for submitting this false information to the register. Karen was adopted by an older couple who died when she was just a teenager Karen's birth was then registered for a third time when she arrived in the USA and she is concerned that laws were broken to facilitate an adoption for a couple who were becoming too old to adopt in America. ""They died when I was a teenager and that was going to have an effect on anybody's life,"" she said. ""And the fact that their health and age was overlooked because of the desire of the people who ran the orphanage, I don't think is justifiable or acceptable."" The BBC has also seen the adoption consent form signed by Karen's birth mother which agreed she could be taken into the care of a Catholic adoption organisation in the Republic of Ireland. This document appears to have been signed after the falsified birth certificate in the Republic of Ireland had been created. At the time a baby could only be moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland following a court order or with the express consent of the mother. Toni Maguire, an archaeologist and anthropologist, believes Karen may have been taken illegally to the Republic of Ireland before her mother had consented to it. ""If you are taking a baby from one country basically to another country, I would call it trafficking,"" she said. ""If you then are giving that child or allowing that child to be adopted, how do we deal with that? Is that illegal?"" File on 4 accessed Marianvale home's baptismal register The BBC has discovered that Karen is one of scores of babies who were born at Marianvale and taken out of Northern Ireland for adoption. File on 4 accessed the home's baptism book, which revealed extensive movement of babies and women across state borders. The ledger contained details of more than 800 babies born to Marianvale women. The BBC has established at least 25 babies left Northern Ireland, mostly going to families in the Republic of Ireland, but at least two went to the USA. Meanwhile, at least 120 women came from outside Northern Ireland to Marianvale, from as far afield as Fife, London, Plymouth and Manchester. Patrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said: ""This now cries out for a thorough, independent investigation and I think what will certainly need to happen is that there is a strong cross-border cross-jurisdictional dimension to any investigation into what happened in Northern Ireland."" In response, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd said: ""We utterly reject any suggestion that illegal adoptions were conducted from Marianvale. ""All adoptions were conducted strictly in accordance with the legislation which then applied. ""Some women did not proceed with adoption, as was originally planned, and with the support of families, took their babies home.""

Tribute to 'final victim' of Grenfell fire,"Six members of the Choucair family spanning three generations died Families of those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire left an inquiry in tears after a video of the blaze was shown without a warning. One woman was said to have collapsed outside the hearing after seeing the video, which included footage filmed from inside the burning building. An inquiry official apologised, saying a warning system had failed. The second day has been dedicated to commemorations of those killed, including six members of one family. A nephew of one of the 72 victims said the bereaved wanted ""the truth"" and ""those in power"" must ""listen to our stories and learn from your mistakes."" Karim Mussily, whose uncle Hesham Rahman lived on the 23rd floor, earned a standing ovation from other relatives in the room when he told the inquiry: ""We've been censored enough, it's our time; whether you like it or not, you have to listen."" Tributes were paid to Hesham Rahman including by his sister Noha A video about the Choucair family started with clips of the fire in which people could be seen at windows surrounded by flames and screams could be heard. Between 20 and 30 people left the room and wails could be heard outside. The BBC's Emma Harrison said some were in extreme states of distress. The inquiry at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel, South Kensington, paused while the person who collapsed received medical treatment. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 2 What happened at the tower block? Bernard Richmond QC, who is leading the presentations by bereaved family members, said he was sorry a warning had not been read out before the film was shown. He said it had been a busy day and a system the inquiry had put in place for warning of troubling material had failed before this particular video was shown. When the hearing resumed, Mr Mussily said on a previous visit to his uncle the lift had been broken and the single staircase was narrow. He said: ""I couldn't help but think how on earth would my uncle escape if there was a fire."" Mierna, Fatima and Zainab Choukair died along with their grandmother and parents Hisam Choucair, who lost his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nieces in the blaze on 14 June 2017, had earlier told the inquiry how he could only watch helplessly as they died. Mr Choucair said the deaths of his mother Sirria, 60, sister Nadia, 30, her husband Bassem Choukair, 40, and their daughters Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and three-year-old Zainab was an ""atrocity"". He said he had ""always had a bad feeling"" about the building. Mr Choucair said when he got to the scene the building was ""completely engulfed in flames"" and he simply had to ""stand there for hours watching them all burn to death"". He said his mother, who arrived from Lebanon as a teenager in the 1970s, was ""loving, kind and patient"" while his sister and her husband, who lived two doors away from her in the block, were very popular and hard-working. He said his eldest niece, Mierna, had an ""excellent sense of humour"", loved sport, music and school and wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer. Bassem Choukair and his wife Nadia were very popular, the inquiry was told His sister Sawsam, who lived with their mother in the tower, also spoke of her grief. She said she managed to speak to Bassem on the phone during the fire, adding: ""His first thoughts were to reassure me. ""He told me everything was alright, even though he was trapped with my family in a burning building."" ByBBC reporter Emma Harrison Laughter fills the room during lighter moments of the tributes, as family members recall funny stories or traits of their loved ones. But the tears continue to flow as those reading emotional tributes struggle to maintain composure throughout their statements. The support and empathy towards those talking is strong, and the audience shows appreciation for their bravery with applause. As the first day had already witnessed, the common theme so far is how incomprehensible their deaths were and the need, as one family member put it, ""to find out the truth"". This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The second day of the inquiry also heard from the husband of Maria Del Pilar Burton, who is regarded as the final of the 72 victims. Mrs Burton, 74, who had dementia, died in January after her health deteriorated following the fire. In an emotional tribute, Nicholas Burton said it took away her ""dignity and everything we had in this world"". Maria Del Pilar Burton died in hospital in January Mrs Burton, known as Pily, was born in Spain in the 1940s and was one was one of the very first residents in Grenfell Tower. Mr Burton, who was with his wife for 34 years, told the inquiry she was an ""extraordinary woman"". He said: ""She was a unique, beautiful, exceptional person until this tragedy had taken it away."" Also commemorated were Rania Ibrahim, 30, and her daughters Fathia, five, and Hania, three, who lived on the 23rd floor of the building. Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fathia, known as Fou-Fou, and Hania, lived on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower Rasha Ibrahim said her sister moved to the UK from Egypt in 2009 but the pair remained very close. In a statement read to the inquiry by an interpreter, Mrs Ibrahim said: ""It is so important for me to understand how I have lost my beloved sister while my children have lost their little cousins."" Debbie Lamprell was 45 years old A tribute to Debbie Lamprell, a safety officer at Opera Holland Park, from her mother said the 45-year-old was ""always laughing"". Miriam Lamprell said she was ""bereft"" without her daughter and she felt a part of her had been ""ripped out"". A memorial stone has been placed at Opera Holland Park, where Debbie Lamprell worked Relatives of all 72 victims will be given the chance to commemorate loved ones during the inquiry, which will look into all the deaths. Families are being given as long as they need to tell the inquiry about their loved ones through a mixture of words, pictures and videos. A minute's silence was held at the start of the afternoon session to respectthe anniversary of the Manchester terrorist attack. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell: Unpacking our old life.

"How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket toutsThe pop star has taken an aggressive stance by cancelling more than 10,000 tickets for his tour.1han hour agoEntertainment & Arts","Ed Sheeran has taken an aggressive stance against touts by cancelling more than 10,000 tickets for his upcoming stadium tour. After the tour went on sale, the star's team identified purchases by known touts and revoked their tickets. Any tickets listed for re-sale on sites like Viagogo were also cancelled. Fans who'd bought from those sites - often at vastly inflated prices - were given assistance in claiming refunds and getting genuine tickets. So far, more than Â£240,000 has been returned to fans who inadvertently bought invalid tickets. ""We're achieving exactly what Ed wanted, which is 'we want you to come in and pay this [fixed] price,'"" said Stuart Galbraith of concert promoters Kilimanjaro Live. A further 500 tickets are going to be cancelled this week, ahead of Sheeran's first night at Manchester's Etihad Stadium, he added. Allow YouTube content?

Sheeran's team decided to pursue touts after hundreds of tickets for a Teenage Cancer Trust gig were snapped up and sold for profit last March. He imposed strict conditions on his 18-date stadium tour, including: Names printed on tickets, with ID required at the door A maximum of four tickets per customer Tickets listed for resale to be cancelled Any tickets bought by a ""business or trader""  to be cancelled In addition, the on-sale date was a Saturday - rather than the traditional Friday - to make sure genuine fans had the greatest possible chance of being online. Sheeran also partnered withTwickets,external- a site which allows fans to swap tickets at face value or less, in order to protect fans from the ""unethical practices"" of touts. Galbraith negotiated with ticket resellers Get Me In, Seatwave and StubHub to make sure they wouldn't list tickets for the tour - in some cases, using the threat of prosecution under the Consumer Rights Act to reinforce his point. ""The only agency which listed against our wishes and ignored all our correspondence was Viagogo,"" said Galbraith. Once tickets had been sold, the promoters ""very laboriously"" went through all the transactions and ""identified known touts and multiple purchases"". Those tickets, and any listed on sites like Viagogo were immediately invalidated. The woman taking on Viagogo Ticket resellers 'misleading' consumers ""We refunded everybody even though we know they're power sellers and touts, so we can't be accused of taking double income off a single ticket,"" said Galbraith. When the tour launches, anyone who turns up unaware their ticket has been cancelled will be met by a customer care team, he added. ""We'll have teams that say, 'your ticket is invalid' and it'll be stamped invalid. That's important because it will enable them to go back to Viagogo and claim a refund. ""What we'll also then do is... send them to the next window and sell them a ticket at face value."" Arctic Monkeys have also been battling touts on their upcoming UK tour He added: ""We genuinely hope we turn away as few people as possible. Because at the end of the day, even the people who've bought in the secondary market, as far as Ed is concerned, are still his [fans]."" At the time of writing, Viagogo was still offering tickets to the tour, with prices in excess of Â£400, compared to a face value of between Â£49 and Â£88. Sheeran's ticketing system is not a first - Glastonbury and the West End musical Hamilton operate similar policies - but no-one has attempted it for a large-scale tour before. It was conceived with the help of theFanFair Alliance,external, which lobbies against the ""black market"" in concert tickets, and has already been mimicked by the Arctic Monkeys for their upcoming UK tour. Their manager, Ian McAndrew, said he and the band had grown tired of fans being ""misled, confused and, I believe, fraudulently led to spend large sums of money on tickets, even when tickets are actually still available"" at face value. In total, the band sold 190,000 tickets with only a small percentage appearing on secondary resale sites. Again, only Viagogo refused a request not to list the tickets. The Swiss-based site iscurrently facing legal actionover its failure to comply with consumer protection laws. Asked for a response to this story, Viagogo directed the BBC to theFAQ section,externalof its website, where it protests against concert promoters who deny entry to fans using resold tickets. ""These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal,"" it says.

"Belarus slams UK embassy over rainbow flagOfficials accuse the UK of challenging ""traditional values"" as it marked the day against homophobia.1han hour agoEurope","A video of the flag was posted on the embassy's Instagram account Belarus has slammed the UK embassy in Minsk for flying a rainbow flag on the International Day Against Homophobia, calling LGBT relationships ""fake"". In a lengthy statement, the Interior Ministry said the UK was challenging the country's ""traditional values"". ""The LGBT community, and all this fight for 'their rights', and the very day of the community are just a fake!"" A spokeswoman for the embassy said it would not comment. Homosexuality is not illegal in Belarus but it is a taboo. Marriage between same-sex people is not recognised and activists say the government has intensified a crackdown on the LGBT community. The secret executions in Europe's 'last dictatorship' Belarus country profile Often described as Europe's ""last dictatorship"", Belarus has been ruled with an iron fist by President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. In 2012,he famously declared it was ""better to be a dictator than gay""after complaints of human rights abuses in the country. In the statement issued on Sunday, the government accused the UK of creating ""problems where they do not exist"", saying the day against homophobia, celebrated on 17 May, had never been significant in the country. ""The reason for this is obvious - the overwhelming majority of Belarusians stick to traditional family values, including Christian ones. And such statements are a challenge to these values."" Relationships between men and women were the ""only way of reproduction"", it added. ""No matter which way you look at it but a same-sex relationship is a fake. And the essence of the fake is always the same - the erosion of the truth.""

Secret badger baiting network exposed,"This video can not be played BBC Wales Investigates went undercover to expose badger-baiting gangs A secret network of badger baiters has been exposed by an undercover BBC Wales investigation Secret filmingshows two men pulling a cub from the ground and setting dogs on it before killing it with a spade. Other members of the network, including a convicted badger baiter banned from keeping dogs, were filmed illegally digging a sett in Pembrokeshire. RSPCA special operations unit head Ian Briggs said there was ""a particular problem"" with badger baiting in Wales. Undercover with badger baiters as network infiltrated Animal cruelty jail sentences increased He said this was because of ""remoteness and the ease of which they [badger baiters] can carry out their activities"". BBC Wales Investigatesinfiltrated two gangs as part of a six-month investigation into the violent and brutal blood sport. It is the first time in more than 30 years a badger baiting group has been infiltrated in this way. Undercover filming saw men digging into a badger sett in Pembrokeshire It discovered Wales and parts of the English borders were hotspots and uncovered a network of illegal hunters across south Wales. It also revealed the brutal reality of how wild animals - and the dogs used to kill them - were treated. Tomas Young from the Gwent valleys claimed he shot his dogs when they did not perform as he wanted. Performing bear at football match 'inhumane' New rules for exotic animal parties Vet Mike Jessop, an expert witness for dozens of animal welfare prosecutions, said: ""The dog is just another working tool. They're just thrown down holes, they've got to do their job. If they're not doing their job they become a useless commodity. ""This is the classic blood sport activity that we all thought had been brought under some sort of control - this is showing clearly it hasn't."" The Protection of Badgers Act 1992,externalbans people from injuring, killing or taking the animal or disturbing their setts. But police forces are not obliged to report incidents of badger baiting investigations - or outcomes - to the Home Office, meaning the scale of the crime is unknown. The RSPCA's Ian Briggs said badger baiting was ""hugely prevalent across the whole of the UK"" The Ministry of Justice said 13 people across England and Wales were convicted in 2016 - four were in Wales. But information compiled by charities suggested there were 18 reports of badger baiting in Wales over 17 months ending in 2017 and four reports of dug badger setts. Labour's shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, said: ""If we're going to genuinely tackle something we need to know the extent of the problem and the only way we're going to properly know the extent of the problem is to record it effectively."" Mr Briggs said prosecutions relied on the RSPCA getting ""information from friends, family, neighbours, who are aware of what these people are doing"". The investigation also uncovered a convicted badger baiter boasting on a closed Facebook group dedicated to Patterdale terriers about digs he had recently been on and puppies he was breeding. Mr Young denies all allegations against him. A spokesman for RSPCA Cymru said: ""We have requested all material from the BBC in relation to their investigations related to alleged illegal badger baiting activity in Wales - and are awaiting this evidence. ""Badger baiting is a barbaric activity - and we will investigate thoroughly any evidence passed onto us which suggest crimes have been committed against these animals.""

Archbishop guilty of child abuse cover-up,"Philip Wilson faces a maximum two-year sentence An Australian court has found a Catholic archbishop guilty of concealing child sexual abuse in the 1970s. Philip Wilson, now archbishop of Adelaide, becomes the most senior Catholic in the world to be charged and convicted of the offence. He was found to have covered up the abuse of altar boys by a paedophile priest colleague in New South Wales. During his trial he denied being told about the abuse by some of the victims. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Catholic Church 'abused 4,400 children' Wilson will be sentenced in June and faces a maximum two-year jail term. Last month, Wilson told the Newcastle Local Court he had no knowledge of priest James Fletcher's actions, which took place when he was an assistant priest in Maitland, 130km (80 miles) north of Sydney. Fletcher was later convicted of nine child sexual abuse charges in 2004, and died in jail in 2006. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know One of his victims, former altar boy Peter Creigh, told the court he had described the abuse to Wilson in detail in 1976, five years after it took place. Peter Creigh testified that he had told Wilson about being abused Magistrate Robert Stone rejected Wilson's claims that he had no memory of the conversation, and said he had found Mr Creigh to be a reliable witness. The priest knew ""what he was hearing was a credible allegation and the accused wanted to protect the Church and its reputation"", Magistrate Stone said. Another victim, who cannot be named, told the court he disclosed the abuse in the confessional box when he was 11 years old. He said Wilson told him he was telling lies and to recite 10 Hail Mary prayers as punishment. In a statement issued by the Church on Wednesday, Wilson said he was ""obviously disappointed"" with the verdict and would consider his legal options. Archbishop of Adelaide Philip Wilson outside the city's cathedral in 2002 His lawyers had tried to get the case thrown out on four occasions, after the 67-year-old was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Child sexual abuse survivors praised the verdict in emotional scenes outside the court following the decision. ""The decision will hopefully unravel the hypocrisy, the deceit and the abuse of power and trust that the Church has displayed,"" Mr Creigh told reporters. In 2012, then PM Julia Gillard set up a royal commission, the country's highest form of public inquiry, to look into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. By the time it had published its final report in December last year, it had handled 42,000 calls and referred more than 2,500 cases to the authorities. It said institutions including churches, schools and sports clubs had ""seriously failed"" to protect children. Catholic institutions came in for particular criticism. The president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Denis Hart, offered an ""unconditional"" apology. PM Malcolm Turnbull said ""a national tragedy"" had been exposed. Acting on Australia's landmark abuse inquiry The first cases of molestation by priests came to light in the 1980s. In the 1990s, revelations began of widespread abuse in Ireland, with cases spreading to more than a dozen countries this century. The abuse victim who has protested in the same spot for 20 years Ireland, the US and Australia have carried out national inquiries, and there have been cover-up scandals such as in the Archdiocese of Boston in the US. Although there have been convictions of priests for sexual abuse, in many cases accused clergymen were either moved or retired by their Church, with financial settlements agreed in some cases, particularly in the US. Victims rights groups have complained the convictions do not often extend beyond priest level, with few senior figures brought to account, although a number have left their positions over their actions in sexual abuse cases,including Cardinal Bernard Law in Boston. One of the most high-profile recent cases has been in Chile.All of its 34 Catholic bishops offered to resign.Pope Francis had handed them a 10-page document accusing Chile's Church hierarchy of negligence in sexual abuse cases. All Chile's 34 bishops offer to resign Pope renews anti-sexual abuse panel 'I still continue to suffer to this day' Video, 00:00:46'I still continue to suffer to this day' Australia abuse 'tragedy' Catholic Church 'abused 4,400 children' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

M&S to close 100 stores by 2022,"Marks and Spencer plans to close 100 stores by 2022, accelerating a reorganisation that it says is ""vital"" for the retailer's future. Of the 100 stores, 21 have already been shut and M&S has now revealed the location of 14 further sites to close. Under its plan,external, M&S wants to move a third of its sales online and plans to have fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations. The latest closures will affect a total of 872 employees. How can M&S get back in fashion? ""Closing stores isn't easy but it is vital for the future of M&S,"" said Sacha Berendji, its retail operations director. He said that where stores have already closed, ""encouraging"" numbers of consumers were now shopping at nearby stores. The company has just over 1,000 UK stores. The 14 M&S stores affected are: Bayswater, Fleetwood (outlet store) and Newton Abbot (outlet store), which are all due to close by the end of July 2018 Clacton and Holloway Road, which will both shut by early 2019 Darlington, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall, which are proposed for closure Since M&S first announced its closure programme in November 2016, 18 stores have shut and three have been relocated. The 18 closures were in Andover, Basildon, Birkenhead, Bournemouth, Bridlington, London Covent Garden, Dover, Durham, Fareham, Fforestfach, Keighley, Portsmouth, London Putney, Redditch, Slough, Stockport, Warrington and Wokingham. The three relocations were in Greenock, Newry and Crewe. M&S store closures are always big news, especially for the towns where the shops have been reassuring fixtures on the high street for decades. This latest wave of closures will feel like a body blow to locations that are already under pressure. But the hard truth is that M&S has more stores than it needs, given our changing shopping habits. Many experts believe that closing a large swathe of stores is a tough but necessary step. One key question is: will those lost fashion and home sales be recaptured online or in the fewer but better physical locations in the future? M&S says there are encouraging signs from towns such as Warrington where it closed a town centre store, but shoppers have since flocked to its new outlet in a retail park. But this business still has a massive task in reviving its fortunes and tomorrow's annual results will be further proof of that. Retail veteran Archie Norman, who took over as M&S chairman last year, said the retailer has been ""drifting"" and promised to speed up changes. Those changes included scaling back ambitions for its Simply Food chain. It had intended to open 40 stores this financial year, but has cut that number to 25. ""M&S is repositioning itself for the new retail world,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Having a huge store estate is no longer the powerful retail force that it once was."" Retail crisis forces hundreds of closures Six reasons behind the High Street crisis The retailer is trying to spur growth after disappointing trading over the Christmas period. In the three months to 30 December, M&S said like-for-like sales fell at its food business, where sales had been rising, as well as at its clothing and homeware division. Investors will be looking for evidence of improvement in the company's annual results on Wednesday. M&S shareswere down 2.6% at 292p in afternoon trading on Tuesday. They had been worth almost 400p a year ago. Maureen Hinton, from analytics firm GlobalData, said M&S was ""perilously close"" to losing its top spot in the UK clothing market to Primark. GlobalData has forecast that its clothing market share will be 7.6% this year - almost halving in two decades - despite opening more stores selling clothing, homewares and food under the one roof. ''To make its space more productive M&S has to produce a compelling offer showcased in an inspiring environment,"" Ms Hinton said. ""Closing stores will make its space more productive and help to improve profitability, but it still has not solved its fundamental problem: top-line growth."" How can M&S get back in fashion?

'Illegal' adoption claims at Catholic home,"As a baby, Karen Trimnell was issued with three birth certificates, including one with numerous false details A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of 'illegal' cross-border adoptions at a home run by Catholic nuns in Northern Ireland. Evidence suggests some children may have been moved out of the UK without their mothers' consent from Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry. One woman was issued with three birth certificates in three countries. The Catholic Good Shepherd Sisters said adoptions were ""conducted strictly in accordance with the legislation"". One of the three birth certificates issued as part of Karen Trimnell's adoption to the USA contained many false details. Karen Trimnell was born in Newry but was adopted and grew up in Texas The Marianvale mother and baby home in County Down operated between 1955 and 1984. It was one of a network of institutions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which offered women the voluntary option for those who were unmarried to give birth in private and give their babies up for adoption. However, BBC radio programme File on 4 has heard claims that some adoptions were not voluntary and uncovered evidence that laws may have been broken. These include falsified details on official documents. Campaigners claim this may have been to facilitate the illegal movement of babies across state borders. The former nuns' residence at the Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry, County Down Karen, 49, an English teacher in New York, was born in 1968. Her mother travelled to Marianvale and gave birth at a nearby hospital. Karen believes she was moved illegally from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland - where she was cared for by another Catholic order - before being adopted by a couple from Texas in the USA. Karen's concerns are based on a stash of documents charting her early life which she passed to File on 4. They revealed that she had been issued with a birth certificate in Northern Ireland which correctly recorded all the details of her birth. But two days earlier, another birth certificate had been generated for her in the Republic of Ireland containing false information, including changing her date and place of birth as well as listing her future adopted parents as her natural parents. It is not clear who was responsible for submitting this false information to the register. Karen was adopted by an older couple who died when she was just a teenager Karen's birth was then registered for a third time when she arrived in the USA and she is concerned that laws were broken to facilitate an adoption for a couple who were becoming too old to adopt in America. ""They died when I was a teenager and that was going to have an effect on anybody's life,"" she said. ""And the fact that their health and age was overlooked because of the desire of the people who ran the orphanage, I don't think is justifiable or acceptable."" The BBC has also seen the adoption consent form signed by Karen's birth mother which agreed she could be taken into the care of a Catholic adoption organisation in the Republic of Ireland. This document appears to have been signed after the falsified birth certificate in the Republic of Ireland had been created. At the time a baby could only be moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland following a court order or with the express consent of the mother. Toni Maguire, an archaeologist and anthropologist, believes Karen may have been taken illegally to the Republic of Ireland before her mother had consented to it. ""If you are taking a baby from one country basically to another country, I would call it trafficking,"" she said. ""If you then are giving that child or allowing that child to be adopted, how do we deal with that? Is that illegal?"" File on 4 accessed Marianvale home's baptismal register The BBC has discovered that Karen is one of scores of babies who were born at Marianvale and taken out of Northern Ireland for adoption. File on 4 accessed the home's baptism book, which revealed extensive movement of babies and women across state borders. The ledger contained details of more than 800 babies born to Marianvale women. The BBC has established at least 25 babies left Northern Ireland, mostly going to families in the Republic of Ireland, but at least two went to the USA. Meanwhile, at least 120 women came from outside Northern Ireland to Marianvale, from as far afield as Fife, London, Plymouth and Manchester. Patrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said: ""This now cries out for a thorough, independent investigation and I think what will certainly need to happen is that there is a strong cross-border cross-jurisdictional dimension to any investigation into what happened in Northern Ireland."" In response, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd said: ""We utterly reject any suggestion that illegal adoptions were conducted from Marianvale. ""All adoptions were conducted strictly in accordance with the legislation which then applied. ""Some women did not proceed with adoption, as was originally planned, and with the support of families, took their babies home.""

FTSE 100 surges to a fresh record high,"London's main index, the FTSE 100, has surged to a fresh record high for the second time in less than a week. The FTSE 100 index closed over 1% higher at 7,859.17, comfortably above its previous high of 7,787 on 17 May. An easing of trade tensions between the US and China cheered investors, analysts said. The dollar rose after the deal, boosting UK-listed miners, oil firms and banks which earn much of their money in dollars. The pound was down 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro, trading at $1.3431 and â¬1.1406 respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, credited the stronger dollar with driving most of the FTSE 100's gains. He warned that the upbeat mood among investors may not last, given that the agreement between China and the US - which avoids a punishing trade war for now -  lacked concrete details. ""The sides could return to blows quickly - there may not be much weight behind the move and the positivity could float off into the atmosphere on the emergence of any downbeat news,"" he said. Mr Wilson said whether the FTSE continued to gain ground would depend largely on what happened to the pound, which was likely to be volatile with the start of a fresh round of Brexit talks on Tuesday. Retail firms were some of the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 on Monday. Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury and Next rose between 2 and 4%, putting them among the top ten biggest risers.

Air quality fourth biggest threat to health,"Plans to tackle sources of air pollution - such as wood-burning stoves - put too much responsibility on local councils, critics say. The government, as part of its clean air strategy, wants to clamp down on all sources of pollution, including coal-burning and ammonia from farms. Campaigners welcome the consultation, but say it does not go far enough. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it would be ""disproportionate"" to have a uniform ban on certain fuels. He said the air pollution effects in rural areas of fuels, such as diesel or coal, are significantly less compared to urban areas as they are dispersed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: ""What we've got here are a series of proportionate measures which we hope will deal with what is a big public health issue."" UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed UK faces European court over dirty air Ministers want to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of pollution from fine particles, known as particulates, by 2025. One of the most contentious proposals is to reduce pollution from wood burners, which, along with solid fuels, cause 38% of particulate pollution. But a source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC there was no plan to ban existing stoves - or the burning of coal and open wood fires, which are far more polluting than wood burners. Sorry, your browser does not support this tool Source: MappAir100 by EarthSense If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhere,externalto reload the page. Farmers, who have largely evaded pollution controls so far, will be told to buy new equipment to reduce airborne ammonia from slurry. The government has been obliged to publish this Clean Air Strategy under an EU rule. It's in addition to the law which has seen the UK taken to court over high levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution. The new legislation would not ban existing wood-burning stoves. However, any new stoves that are sold would have to be cleaner People would be encouraged to burn dry seasoned wood, which emits fewer particulates than wet wood Councils would be given new powers, such as limiting what people can burn or introducing ""no-burn days"" But there is not expected to be a ban on the sale of wet wood, which typically come from garage forecourts Ministers estimate that their plans will reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated Â£1 billion every year by 2020, rising to Â£2.5 billion every year from 2030. They describe air pollution as the fourth biggest threat to public health after cancer, obesity and heart disease. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains - air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment. ""This clean air strategy sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of the government to improve air quality."" All EU nations will have to submit similar plans to cut pollution but Mr Gove says the UK's policies will be carried out beyond Brexit. This video can not be played Michael Gove told Today ""conventional cars"" will be banned by 2040 The legislation will give new powers to local councils so they can solve pollution hotspots. Some councils welcome this approach whilst others think they're being left to do the government's dirty work. Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association said: ""If we're to truly tackle air pollution, we need government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission vehicles and power generation."" Green groups are pleased that the plan will be embedded in new primary legislation - and they applaud the decision to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of particulates. But they say the document so far doesn't say how the government will deal with the on-going problem of NOX emissions from cars. And they accuse it of loading too much work on to local councils. Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""The ambition is impressive - but how is it going to be achieved? Lots of councils simply don't have the resources to deal with these issues."" He said the proposal on wood burners was far too vague: ""Will hard-pressed environmental health officers really be checking on wet wood in forecourts?"" he asked. Sue Hayman MP, Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, said: ""Michael Gove has become the Secretary of State for Consultations - with over 25 consultations published by his department since the General Election and not a single piece of primary legislation brought forward."" Farmers will be supported to cut ammonia emissions through the proposednew farming funding system known as public money for public goods. One technologically-difficult issue is also acknowledged - the contribution to microplastic air pollution and water pollution from vehicle brakes and tyres wearing on the road. The government says it will work with international partners to research and develop new standards. Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Do you have any questions about tackling air pollution?

"Tesco removing some 'best before' datesThe supermarket says removing the labels will help avoid ""perfectly edible food"" being thrown away.11m11 minutes agoBusiness","Tesco is removing ""best before"" labels from many of its fresh produce lines, which it says will help reduce waste. The supermarket will remove the advice from about 70 pre-packaged produce lines to avoid ""perfectly edible food"" being thrown away. The items that will lose the label include apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons, other citrus fruit and onions. ""Best before"" labels indicate that the quality of a product may deteriorate after the date indicated. In contrast ""use by"" dates indicate when it becomes less safe to consume the food. ""We know some customers may be confused by the difference between 'best before' and 'use by' dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded,"" said Mark Little, Tesco's head of food waste. He said fruit and vegetables were among the food most frequently thrown away by consumers, although many are ignoring ""best before"" dates already. ""Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the 'best before' date code on the packaging,"" he added. Stopping the rot: Meet the waste warriors Watch: Turning bread into beer to fight food waste Use By- Cannot be sold, redistributed or consumed after this date. Applied to foods which are highly perishable - such as fresh fish, meat and poultry - and therefore constitute an immediate danger to human health Best Before- Can be sold, redistributed and consumed after this date. Applied to all other kinds of food Some products aren't legally required to carry a date label Only one date label is recommended for each food item Source: Wrap Tesco said removing the information on the label would encourage customers to make their own decisions about the freshness of produce. However, all the produce affected will be items sold in bags or boxes and so are less easy to handle. Individual items, such as loose lemons or onions, already do not carry ""best before"" labels. The supermarket said that although customers would no longer be able to differentiate between bags of produce to determine how fresh they were at purchase, there were ""rigorous stock rotation procedures in place"" to ensure older items did not remain on shelves. Advice issued,externaljointly last year by anti-waste campaign group Wrap, the Food Standards Agency and the Department for the Environment suggested fewer foods should be labelled with ""use by"" dates, including pasteurised fruit drinks and hard cheese. Greater use of ""best before"" dates should be encouraged, they suggested. But a recent survey by the National Federation of Women's Institutes found that less than half of respondents understood what ""best before"" means. However, more than 70% had a clear understanding of ""use by"" labels. Last year, the East of England Co-op, which is separate from the national Co-operative chain,began selling dried and tinned products that were beyond their ""best before"" datesat knock-down prices. Justine Roberts, founder of parenting website Mumsnet, said: ""Mumsnet users are keen not to waste food or, just as importantly, money. ""When it comes to 'best before' dates, most parents on Mumsnet take very little notice. Sad-looking veg often ends up in the slow cooker, leftover portions are put in the freezer for pot-luck nights, bread gets grated for breadcrumbs.""

Missing microbes 'cause' childhood cancer,"Our modern germ-free life is the cause of the most common type of cancer in children, according to one of Britain's most eminent scientists. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects one in 2,000 children. Prof Mel Greaves, from the Institute of Cancer Research, has amassed 30 years of evidence to show the immune system can become cancerous if it does not ""see"" enough bugs early in life. It means it may be possible to prevent the disease. The type of blood cancer is more common in advanced, affluent societies, suggesting something about our modern lives might be causing the disease. There have been wild claims linking power cables, electromagnetic waves and chemicals to the cancer. That has been dismissed in this work published inNature Reviews Cancer,external. Instead, Prof Greaves - who has collaborated with researchers around the world - says there are three stages to the disease. The first is a seemingly unstoppable genetic mutation that happens inside the womb Then a lack of exposure to microbes in the first year of life fails to teach the immune system to deal with threats correctly This sets the stage for an infection to come along in childhood, cause an immune malfunction and leukaemia This ""unified theory"" of leukaemia was not the result of a single study, rather a jigsaw puzzle of evidence that established the cause of the disease. Prof Greaves said: ""The research strongly suggests that acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has a clear biological cause and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed."" Evidence that helped build the case included: An outbreak of swine flu in Milan that led to seven children getting leukaemia Studies showing children who went to nursery or had older siblings, which expose them to bacteria, had lower rates of leukaemia Breastfeeding - which promotes good bacteria in the gut - protects against leukaemia Lower rates in children born vaginally than by caesarean section, which transfers fewer microbes Animals bred completely free of microbes developed leukaemia when exposed to an infection This study is absolutely not about blaming parents for being too hygienic. Rather it shows there is a price being paid for the progress we are making in society and medicine. Coming into contact with beneficial bacteria is complicated, it's not just about embracing dirt. But Prof Greaves adds: ""The most important implication is that most cases of childhood leukaemia are likely to be preventable."" His vision is giving children a safe cocktail of bacteria - such as in a yoghurt drink - that will help train their immune system. This idea will still take further research. In the meantime, Prof Greaves said parents could ""be less fussy about common or trivial infections and encourage social contact with other and older children"". Dr Alasdair Rankin, the director of research at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said: ""We urge parents not to be alarmed by this study. ""While developing a strong immune system early in life may slightly further reduce risk, there is nothing that can be currently done to definitively prevent childhood leukaemia."" This study is part of a massive shift taking place in medicine. To date we have treated microbes as the bad guys. Yet recognising their important role for our health and wellbeing is revolutionising the understanding of diseases from allergies to Parkinson's and depression and now leukaemia. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""Childhood leukaemia is rare and it's currently not known what or if there is anything that can be done to prevent it by either medical professionals or parents. ""We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.""

Cuba plane crash claims 111th victim,"Grettel Landrove's mother, Amparo Font (C) spoke to the BBC outside hospital The death toll of Cuba's deadliest air disaster in 30 years has risen to 111 after one of the survivors died of her injuries on Monday evening. Grettel Landrove, 23, was a flamenco dancer and student engineer. The news comes on the same day that Mexico's civil air authority suspended the operations of a company that owned the plane involved in the crash. Officials said in a statement that AerolÃ­neas Damojh was under ""extraordinary verification"". The charter company had leased the aeroplane in question to Cuban state airlines Cubana de AviaciÃ³n. Speaking to the BBC outside the hospital, Ms Landrove's mother, Amparo Font, described her daughter as a fighter. But her death was announced shortly afterwards. Ms Landrove was one of three initial survivors of Friday's crash. The other two - Mailen Diaz, 19, and Emiley Sanchez, 39 - remain in a critical condition, according to reports. The plane crashed in a field near Havana international airport The plane was reportedly built in 1979. One former pilot said it had dropped off radar once, while another alleged that maintenance was poor. Cuba plane company 'had safety worries' The Mexican General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) statement, in Spanish, saysthe authority will seek information to help the crash investigation,external, and about whether the Mexican company continues to follow regulations. This video can not be played Doctor Jose Luis Castellano described the crash site as ""very painful"" to behold It says AerolÃ­neas Damojh was subject to previous investigations: in 2010, due to a crash in Puerto Vallarta, and in 2013 following a complaint from an airline pilot. The authority has run ""annual checks"" on AerolÃ­neas Damojh, the statement reads, with the most recent in November 2017. All aircraft have to renew their airworthiness certificates every two years. The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency that the plane that crashed had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports,Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets.,external Wreckage was spread over a large area The plane crashed after taking off from Havana airport. It was a scheduled internal flight to the Cuban town of Holguin. All six crew members were Mexican, while the majority of passengers were Cuban. An Argentine couple and two passengers from the dispute territory of Western Sahara were also killed, as was a Mexico tourist.

Grenfell insulation 'never passed fire test',"The fire ripped through the west London tower block on 14 June last year The insulation that burned out of control on Grenfell Tower had never passed the required safety test and should never have been on the building, a BBC investigation has discovered. Panorama understands the manufacturer, Celotex, used extra fire retardant in the product that qualified for the safety certificate. A more flammable version was then sold for public use, the programme believes. Celotex said it is co-operating with the police investigation and inquiry. The company said it could not comment further but wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. But it has not denied any of Panorama's allegations. Panorama also accused Celotex of mis-selling the insulation with misleading marketing. The programme has been advised that the way Celotex tested and sold the insulation could amount to corporate manslaughter. The RS5000 insulation, which was used in the refurbishment of Grenfell, gives off toxic fumes which contain cyanide when it burns. Panorama understands that almost all of the 72 people who died at Grenfell were killed by smoke. Celotex's plastic foam insulation has been used on hundreds of other buildings around the country. Fire safety expert Arnold Tarling said he was shocked by the revelation: ""Well, words fail me. This is absolutely mind-blowing. This material is all over the place."" This video can not be played A University of Central Lancashire fire test for the BBC of the products used in Grenfell Tower shows the cladding core melting and lighting the insulation. The change in formula was not the only problem with the fire safety test that the insulation passed. The BS8414-2 test only showed RS5000 was safe to use on certain new build projects when it was combined with a specific fire-proof cladding panel. But Celotex knowingly misled buyers about RS5000. Its marketing suggested the insulation was suitable for use with other cladding panels and for tower block refurbishment projects like Grenfell. Neither was true. The company was repeatedly warned that its marketing was misleading, but it carried on mis-selling the product anyway. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the fire Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Panorama has discovered Celotex targeted the contractors who were refurbishing Grenfell and specifically offered its flammable insulation - even though the company knew it was going to be combined with combustible cladding panels. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said Panorama's allegations should be investigated: ""If there are breaches of the law then those people need to be held to account."" Celotex said it wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. It said it was co-operating fully with all the inquiries into the Grenfell Tower fire, including the police investigation and the public inquiry. This video can not be played BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton doorsteps the man that managed Grenfell Tower, Robert Black. ""We believe that the right forum for considering and assessing the many, complex and inter-related issues which arise in relation to the fire - and which require consideration of the involvement of all relevant parties - is through these official investigations. We do not think it is appropriate to comment any further outside of or in advance of that process."" When Panorama told Celotex that its actions might amount to corporate manslaughter, the company said: ""We fully recognise the seriousness of the Grenfell fire. It is for this reason that we believe the public inquiry and the police investigation are the right processes to consider the events leading up to the fire, and the night of the fire itself."" Phase two of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire began on Monday The programme also reveals for the first time that the cladding panels and insulation used at Grenfell were never tested together before the fire. Robert Bond, chief executive of the main contractor Rydon, tells the programme that testing of the cladding system wasn't required because ""it was deemed to comply"". But Panorama understands the company had a legal responsibility to test the system for safety. Grenfell: Who is to Blame? will be broadcast on BBC One at 20:00 BST on 21 May.

Fuel price rise threatens consumer spending,"The price of fuel has hit a three-and-a-half-year high as the price of oil continues to climb, putting more pressure on consumers. The average price of petrol has risen to 127.22p a litre and diesel to 129.96p a litre, following a rapid rise in the oil price. Recent figures suggest a squeeze on incomes has begun to ease, with wages growing faster than prices. However, rising fuel prices threaten to prevent inflation slowing. ""Things have started to look better for the UK consumer recently, with inflationary pressures easing and real wage growth finally started picking up,"" said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. However, he said, that drivers had noticed the impact of higher fuel prices at the pumps. ""Filling up the tank is a pretty essential expense for most of us, so the average consumer could find there's a few pounds less in the jar at the end of each month."" Earlier this month, government figures indicated wages grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the three months to March, whereas over the same period the inflation rate was 2.7%. As a result, for the first time in a year, real incomes grew, although they remain lower than they were before the financial crisis. ""Official figures show that transport is routinely the single biggest area of household expenditure bar none and in most cases transport equals the car,"" said Philip Gomm of the RAC Foundation. He said the poorest households tended to be hit hardest because they drive the oldest, least fuel-efficient vehicles. In early 2016, fuel prices dipped almost to the Â£1 a litre mark as oil went below $30 a barrel. Since then both have risen fairly steadily. This month the price of crude oil briefly reached $80 a barrel and is still at levels not seen since 2014. Last week, the chief executive of French oil company Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said he believed oil could reach $100 ""in the coming months"". ""If the boss of one of the world's largest oil companies is talking about $100 a barrel or more, then you have to think things are going to get worse before they get better,"" said Mr Gomm, pointing out that prices at the pumps lag behind prices in the wholesale market. However, Ruth Gregory, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said she expected the impact of higher fuel prices on the UK consumer to remain limited. ""We're expecting the oil price to drift lower by the end of next year. The recent rise mostly reflects geopolitical tension and the potential risk of supply disruption, factors we think should prove temporary."" In the meantime, the overall trend for rising wages would continue she said. ""We've seen clear signs of a revival of pay growth in recent figures and we are expecting a further tick up to around 3% towards the end of this year."" New MOT tests come into force UK's clean car goal 'not ambitious enough' Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank, said while filling the tank represents only around 3% of household expenditure on average, fuel price rises could still dent consumer confidence. ""The sentiment is important,"" he said. ""You really notice [price rises] for things you buy frequently like petrol and food."" He said by July, petrol and diesel prices were likely to be 14-15% higher than a year earlier. When prices rise for non-discretionary things such as fuel, there is less left for ""fun"" items such as holidays and eating out, Mr Clarke said. The higher fuel price comes in the wake of higher crude oil prices. The rise has been driven in part by President Trump's announcement that the US would re-impose sanctions on Iran, overturning the deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and raising fears that Iran's energy exports would be affected. Fresh US sanctions against Venezuela after the re-election of socialist leader, Nicolas Maduro, have also pushed the price of oil higher. Despite this, BP chief executive Bob Dudley has said he expects US shale and increased supply from members of oil producers group Opec to make up for lost production elsewhere. He predicted the oil price would return to between $50 and $65 a barrel in the near future.

Ex-London mayor Livingstone quits Labour,"This video can not be played Ken Livingstone: ""It's better for Labour if I resign"" Ken Livingstone has said he is resigning from the Labour Party. The ex-London mayor has been suspended since 2016 in a row over allegations of anti-Semitism following comments he made about Hitler and Zionism. Mr Livingstone said he did not accept he was guilty of anti-Semitism or bringing Labour into disrepute but his case had become a ""distraction"" for the party and its political ambitions. Jeremy Corbyn said it was a sad moment but it was the ""right thing to do"". Mr Livingstone, an ally of Mr Corbyn, has always maintained that comments he made about the Nazi leader supporting a Jewish homeland when he first came to power in the early 1930 were historically accurate. Speaking in April 2016, Mr Livingstone, who was defending MP Naz Shah over claims she had made anti-Semitic social media posts, said: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" Despite his decision to resign from the party, Mr Livingstone said on Monday he ""did not accept"" the allegation that he was ""in any way guilty of anti-Semitism"". Profile: Ken Livingstone Ken Livingstone 'cannot stay in Labour' Labour extends Livingstone suspension He added that he ""abhorred"" anti-Semitism and was ""truly sorry"" that his historical arguments had ""caused offence and upset in the Jewish community"".

""However, any further disciplinary action against me may drag on for months or even years, distracting attention from Jeremy's policies. ""I am therefore, with great sadness, leaving the Labour Party."" A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said Mr Corbyn's decision to describe Mr Livingstone's resignation as ""sad"" had merely ""rubbed salt into the wound"".

Mr Livingstone was expelled from Labour in 2000 after challenging the party's official candidate in the mayoral contest but returned to the fold later. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Livingstone's departure from the partywould be a relief to Mr Corbyn. ""Mr Corbyn wants people to believe that he is taking anti-Semitism seriously. While Mr Livingstone was still a member that was challenging to say the least,"" she said. ""Although he and Mr Corbyn were fellow political travellers for years, he had long passed the point of being helpful to his old friend."" ""After much consideration, I have decided to resign from the Labour Party. The ongoing issues around my suspension from the Labour Party have become a distraction from the key political issue of our time - which is to replace a Tory government overseeing falling living standards and spiralling poverty, while starving our schools and the NHS of the vital resources they need. We live in dangerous times and there are many issues I wish to speak up on and contribute my experience from running London... from the need for real action to tackle climate change, to opposing Trump's war-mongering, to the need to end austerity and invest in our future here in Britain. I do not accept the allegation that I have brought the Labour Party into disrepute - nor that I am in any way guilty of anti-Semitism. I abhor anti-Semitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so. I also recognise that the way I made a historical argument has caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. I am truly sorry for that. Under Labour's new general secretary I am sure there will be rapid action to expel anyone who genuinely has anti-Semitic views. I am loyal to the Labour Party and to Jeremy Corbyn. However any further disciplinary action against me may drag on for months or even years, distracting attention from Jeremy's policies. I am therefore, with great sadness, leaving the Labour Party. We desperately need an end to Tory rule, and a Corbyn-led government to transform Britain and end austerity. I will continue to work to this end, and I thank all those who share this aim and who have supported me in my own political career.""

Manchester remembers attack victims,"This video can not be played The day of remembrance included a national minute's silence An emotional memorial service marking the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack has been held. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds injured when a bomb was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined families of victims at the Manchester Cathedral service. The Dean of Manchester said it was for ""those whose lives were lost and those whose lives have been changed forever"". It was broadcast to the crowds outside in Cathedral Gardens on a giant screen. This video can not be played Who were the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena attack? Live updates as Manchester remembers the victims of the attack Welcoming people to the service, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender said they had ""come together as people of different faiths and none"" to remember those affected by the attack. He was followed by short addresses from a number of faith leaders, including Nidhi Sinha, Rabbi Warren Elf, Imam Irfan Chishti and Sukhbir Singh, and from humanist Dr Kevin Malone. The Duke of Cambridge joined political leaders and the families of the victims at the service Twenty-two candles were lit in Manchester Cathedral for the victims A crowd also gathered in St Ann's Square, where tributes were laid a year ago It also saw a bible reading from the Duke of Cambridge and performances from the Manchester Cathedral Choir and the Halle Youth Choir, who sang a rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. The service, which had been relayed live to screens in Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, York Minster and Glasgow Cathedral, closed with a blessing from the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu. After leaving the cathedral, Prince William, Mrs May and other political leaders, including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, left messages on the ""Trees of Hope"" - a trail of trees which are beingadorned with special tags for the anniversary. At the scene: Stewart Whittingham, BBC News Hundreds gathered in Cathedral Gardens to watch the service and those present spoke of love, not hate. Two women hugged each other for support as two giant silver 22 balloons fluttered above them in the wind, while a teenage girl sobbed as photos of the victims were shown on a giant screen. Tears rolled down a man's face behind his sunglasses, as he struggled to control his emotions. And as the Dean of Manchester announced the minute's silence, the whole crowd rose as one. Police officers, firefighters, teens in Ariana Grande T-shirts and pensioners bowed their heads together and two men dressed in bee costumes stood next to a man waving an anti-IS banner. Just as it was a year ago, this was a city united. The day of remembrance also included a national minute's silence at 14:30 BST and a mass sing-along in the city.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Livingstone's departure from the partywould be a relief to Mr Corbyn. ""Mr Corbyn wants people to believe that he is taking anti-Semitism seriously. While Mr Livingstone was still a member that was challenging to say the least,"" she said. ""Although he and Mr Corbyn were fellow political travellers for years, he had long passed the point of being helpful to his old friend."" ""After much consideration, I have decided to resign from the Labour Party. The ongoing issues around my suspension from the Labour Party have become a distraction from the key political issue of our time - which is to replace a Tory government overseeing falling living standards and spiralling poverty, while starving our schools and the NHS of the vital resources they need. We live in dangerous times and there are many issues I wish to speak up on and contribute my experience from running London... from the need for real action to tackle climate change, to opposing Trump's war-mongering, to the need to end austerity and invest in our future here in Britain. I do not accept the allegation that I have brought the Labour Party into disrepute - nor that I am in any way guilty of anti-Semitism. I abhor anti-Semitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so. I also recognise that the way I made a historical argument has caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. I am truly sorry for that. Under Labour's new general secretary I am sure there will be rapid action to expel anyone who genuinely has anti-Semitic views. I am loyal to the Labour Party and to Jeremy Corbyn. However any further disciplinary action against me may drag on for months or even years, distracting attention from Jeremy's policies. I am therefore, with great sadness, leaving the Labour Party. We desperately need an end to Tory rule, and a Corbyn-led government to transform Britain and end austerity. I will continue to work to this end, and I thank all those who share this aim and who have supported me in my own political career.""

"Grenfell insulation 'never passed fire test'The insulation used to refurbish Grenfell should never have been on the building, BBC Panorama finds.","The fire ripped through the west London tower block on 14 June last year The insulation that burned out of control on Grenfell Tower had never passed the required safety test and should never have been on the building, a BBC investigation has discovered. Panorama understands the manufacturer, Celotex, used extra fire retardant in the product that qualified for the safety certificate. A more flammable version was then sold for public use, the programme believes. Celotex said it is co-operating with the police investigation and inquiry. The company said it could not comment further but wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. But it has not denied any of Panorama's allegations. Panorama also accused Celotex of mis-selling the insulation with misleading marketing. The programme has been advised that the way Celotex tested and sold the insulation could amount to corporate manslaughter. The RS5000 insulation, which was used in the refurbishment of Grenfell, gives off toxic fumes which contain cyanide when it burns. Panorama understands that almost all of the 72 people who died at Grenfell were killed by smoke. Celotex's plastic foam insulation has been used on hundreds of other buildings around the country. Fire safety expert Arnold Tarling said he was shocked by the revelation: ""Well, words fail me. This is absolutely mind-blowing. This material is all over the place."" This video can not be played A University of Central Lancashire fire test for the BBC of the products used in Grenfell Tower shows the cladding core melting and lighting the insulation. The change in formula was not the only problem with the fire safety test that the insulation passed. The BS8414-2 test only showed RS5000 was safe to use on certain new build projects when it was combined with a specific fire-proof cladding panel. But Celotex knowingly misled buyers about RS5000. Its marketing suggested the insulation was suitable for use with other cladding panels and for tower block refurbishment projects like Grenfell. Neither was true. The company was repeatedly warned that its marketing was misleading, but it carried on mis-selling the product anyway. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the fire Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Panorama has discovered Celotex targeted the contractors who were refurbishing Grenfell and specifically offered its flammable insulation - even though the company knew it was going to be combined with combustible cladding panels. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said Panorama's allegations should be investigated: ""If there are breaches of the law then those people need to be held to account."" Celotex said it wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. It said it was co-operating fully with all the inquiries into the Grenfell Tower fire, including the police investigation and the public inquiry. This video can not be played BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton doorsteps the man that managed Grenfell Tower, Robert Black. ""We believe that the right forum for considering and assessing the many, complex and inter-related issues which arise in relation to the fire - and which require consideration of the involvement of all relevant parties - is through these official investigations. We do not think it is appropriate to comment any further outside of or in advance of that process."" When Panorama told Celotex that its actions might amount to corporate manslaughter, the company said: ""We fully recognise the seriousness of the Grenfell fire. It is for this reason that we believe the public inquiry and the police investigation are the right processes to consider the events leading up to the fire, and the night of the fire itself."" Phase two of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire began on Monday The programme also reveals for the first time that the cladding panels and insulation used at Grenfell were never tested together before the fire. Robert Bond, chief executive of the main contractor Rydon, tells the programme that testing of the cladding system wasn't required because ""it was deemed to comply"". But Panorama understands the company had a legal responsibility to test the system for safety. Grenfell: Who is to Blame? will be broadcast on BBC One at 20:00 BST on 21 May.

Turkey to jail 104 coup suspects for life,"This video can not be played Mr Erdogan addressed an Istanbul crowd a year after the failed coup A Turkish court has sentenced 104 former military officers to life in prison for their involvement in a 2016 coup attempt, state media report. They were given ""aggravated life sentences"", which come with tougher terms than a normal life sentence. The country's president had previously said he backed reintroducing the death penalty for coup plotters. The failed coup to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan left at least 260 dead and 2,200 injured on 15 July 2016. The Turkish government has since led a crackdown on alleged coup supporters, with the dismissal of more than 150,000 state employees and the arrest of some 50,000 people. A brief guide to Turkey's coup In Pictures: Battle on Bosphorus Bridge Of the 280 ex-military people on trial, the court in Izmir also served lesser sentences to a further 52 defendants. Sitting in Izmir in western Turkey, the court gave 21 people 20 years in prison for ""assisting the assassination of the president"", while 31 others were sentenced to between seven and 11 years for ""membership of a terrorist organisation"", state news agency Anadolu reported. President Erdogan had backed reintroducing the death penalty for coup plotters. He also said they should wear Guantanamo Bay-style uniforms. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004. The Turkish authorities accused a movement loyal to the Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of organising the 2016 plot. Mr Gulen, who has been in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999, denies any involvement, and Washington has so far resisted calls from the Turkish authorities to extradite him. Nearly 500 on trial over Turkey coup plot Turkey suspends 9,000 police in crackdown Why Turkish stability matters to the region and beyond Rebel soldiers had attempted to overthrow the government overnight and plotters tried to detain Mr Erdogan as he holidayed in an Aegean resort. However, he had left 15 minutes before and the coup was thwarted by civilians and soldiers loyal to the president. A purge followed the coup, in which thousands of public employees from police officers to teachers were sacked or arrested under suspicion of stirring up dissent. Mr Erdogan's critics say he is using the purge to stifle political dissent.

Company suspended after Cuba plane crash,"Grettel Landrove's mother, Amparo Font (C) spoke to the BBC outside hospital The death toll of Cuba's deadliest air disaster in 30 years has risen to 111 after one of the survivors died of her injuries on Monday evening. Grettel Landrove, 23, was a flamenco dancer and student engineer. The news comes on the same day that Mexico's civil air authority suspended the operations of a company that owned the plane involved in the crash. Officials said in a statement that AerolÃ­neas Damojh was under ""extraordinary verification"". The charter company had leased the aeroplane in question to Cuban state airlines Cubana de AviaciÃ³n. Speaking to the BBC outside the hospital, Ms Landrove's mother, Amparo Font, described her daughter as a fighter. But her death was announced shortly afterwards. Ms Landrove was one of three initial survivors of Friday's crash. The other two - Mailen Diaz, 19, and Emiley Sanchez, 39 - remain in a critical condition, according to reports. The plane crashed in a field near Havana international airport The plane was reportedly built in 1979. One former pilot said it had dropped off radar once, while another alleged that maintenance was poor. Cuba plane company 'had safety worries' The Mexican General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) statement, in Spanish, saysthe authority will seek information to help the crash investigation,external, and about whether the Mexican company continues to follow regulations. This video can not be played Doctor Jose Luis Castellano described the crash site as ""very painful"" to behold It says AerolÃ­neas Damojh was subject to previous investigations: in 2010, due to a crash in Puerto Vallarta, and in 2013 following a complaint from an airline pilot. The authority has run ""annual checks"" on AerolÃ­neas Damojh, the statement reads, with the most recent in November 2017. All aircraft have to renew their airworthiness certificates every two years. The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency that the plane that crashed had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports,Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets.,external Wreckage was spread over a large area The plane crashed after taking off from Havana airport. It was a scheduled internal flight to the Cuban town of Holguin. All six crew members were Mexican, while the majority of passengers were Cuban. An Argentine couple and two passengers from the dispute territory of Western Sahara were also killed, as was a Mexico tourist.

Officers 'badly affected' by arena attack,"A few officers are receiving specialist help for post traumatic stress disorder, Ian Hopkins said Officers ""had to do things nobody should ever have to do"" during the Manchester Arena bombing, said Greater Manchester Police's chief constable. About 1,000 officers have been through the force's welfare programme with some ""badly affected"", Ian Hopkins said. He also revealed he shed tears after talking with the families of the 22 victims murdered on 22 May last year. The upcoming anniversary was a time to think about the victims' families and those ""massively traumatised"", he said. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device at 22:31 BST as 14,000 people streamed out of an Ariana Grande concert, leaving more than 700 injured. Mr Hopkins, head of the force since 2015, said ""in moments of quietness"" he shed tears after meeting loved ones of the victims, many of them children. Twenty two people were killed in the blast on 22 May ""They are very courageous people... it was about hearing their hopes and aspirations that they had for their loved ones and those being torn away, brutally torn away, that was one of the most difficult periods, yes."" He said it was ""really terrible"" and some of his colleagues ""saw things and had to do things that nobody should ever have to do"" but ""don't want to speak about, certainly not publicly"". A very small number were receiving specialist help for post traumatic stress disorder, he said. Who were the victims? Manchester Arena bombing timeline Arena report leaves 'mixture of feelings' Manchester Arena bombing: What have we learned? Speaking ahead of events planned to mark the first anniversary of the bombing next Tuesday, he said the murder investigation has been ""phenomenal in terms of its scale and complexity"". ""We've always had the resources... there was a time for about two weeks where we had about 220 officers a day helping us here. ""Not only at the time did we get the counter terrorist resources all around the country but we also got support from every single police force in England, Wales and Scotland,"" he said. Mr Hopkins said his ""immediate reaction was just one of anger... I've been there with my family"" Remembering the night, he said his ""immediate reaction was just one of anger"" after he took a call at home from a deputy within minutes of the attack. He said ""people were angry and I talked about my anger, but that very quickly turned to defiance and it turned to hope"" in the days and weeks after. Every GMP officer has been given the Manchester bee tie pin to thank them Mr Hopkins said he was proud of the way his officers dealt with the attack when there was ""so much uncertainty at the time, reports coming in of gunshots being heard, suspicious packages"". ""Some of the really memorable pictures from my perspective were people running away from the arena, and quite rightly, but my officers running towards it."" He said every member of staff has been given a Manchester bee tie pin to thank them for their work.

'I must've died 200 times in my nightmares'VideoVideoManchester bombing survivors choirManchester attack: The victimsVideoVideoManchester attack: Remembering SaffieOfficers 'badly affected' by arena attack,"Manchester is marking the first anniversary of the arena bombing. The survivors of the atrocity, in which 22 people died, explain how they have coped and how they are approaching the milestone. Daren Buckley helped treat and comfort the wounded and dying ForDaren Buckley, life changed forever when 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device. The 50-year-old had been about to leave the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena when the blast almost knocked him and his son off their feet. The pair had been standing only nine metres (30ft) from the bomber, and Mr Buckley struggles to describe the ""complete chaos"" of the moments that followed, which were filled with screams and confusion. Yet the father of four's first instinct was not to flee, but to run to help the wounded - ripping up piles of souvenir Ariana Grande T-shirts to be used as bandages. He said: ""We saw a big puff of smoke and a flash. It knocked us back. We thought the building was about to collapse. I couldn't hear anything - it was like water was in my ears. ""I took my son to a safe place with another chap and said to him to stay there, that I had to go and help. ""That's when the screaming started. The scenes in the foyer I can't describe. It was like a nightmare. I thought someone was going to tap me on my shoulder and say it was a dream."" Thousands attended a vigil in Manchester's Albert Square following the bombing Mr Buckley, who has basic first aid training, joined a handful of arena staff who initially tended to the injured and dying. He continued: ""I looked around on the floor. Some people were moving, some weren't. I was talking to people who seemed alright, just trying to reassure them. It was just an instinct, which is human."" The emergency services soon arrived, before armed police declared the area a crime scene, and Mr Buckley and his son were moved away. A year later, the married pub cellar man remains traumatised. Manchester remembers arena bomb victims Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Attack 'could have been stopped' Mr Buckley, from Swinton, has only recently felt able to return to Manchester city centre, but he plans to go to the service at the city's cathedral. He said he'd found comfort in joining the Manchester Survivors Choir, which will be performing at Tuesday'ssing-along event in Albert Square, but that his recovery was far from complete. ""If I hear sirens I'm thinking 'do I have to go and help someone else?' - I feel like I'm still in adrenaline mode,"" he said. ""It's strange because I never used to have fear over anything. I have flashbacks. ""I must've died 200 times in my nightmares."" Lyndsay Turner and her son Ciaran Danson say it has been a struggle to get help WhenLyndsay Turnerbought her two children tickets to the concert she wanted to make sure it was a special evening and hired a limo. She had originally planned to go with them but was awaiting surgery so gave the ticket to her sister-in-law, who attended with Lyndsay's mother. However, she kept in touch with her family throughout the night, and was on the phone to her sonCiaran Danson, now 14, when the explosion happened. ""I heard the bang and I said 'Ciaran, what's that?' and I could hear panic in his voice and then the phone went dead."" It wasn't until 45 minutes later that her mother was able to ring. ""The fact that I bought the tickets, I put them in danger, it'll always live with me,"" she said. Ciaran still hopes to follow in his hero's footsteps and become a singer one day Both children were left with severe post-traumatic stress. Tegan, now 12, spent some time in hospital and Ciaran is still struggling. He has flashbacks, has been unable to sleep and experiences ""very scary"" hallucinations of the attacker, he said. ""It was just a blur at first but now he's as real as you or me."" Ms Turner, from Blackpool, says ""a part of her children died that night"" and Ciaran also says he has changed. The teenager said: ""Before that I was very bubbly and happy, I was always singing and acting and now I feel depressed, I just don't want to go out of the house."" He said he had struggled to get mental health support and felt ""forgotten"". ""I had counselling for six weeks. It helped a bit, but not much and then after that I got left. ""I've just been waiting for referral after referral with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. I've only just been seen now. "" Armed police stand guard near ambulances on the night of the bombing One of the hardest things for Ciaran has been bullying, which has resulted in him being taken out of school by his social worker. He will be attending a non-mainstream school over the next few months. Ms Turner said children have made ""flippant"" and ""disgusting"" comments, highlighting one incident in particular. ""An Asian child had started at the school and some pupils thought it would be funny to say 'she's here to blow you up',"" she said. ""It's disgusting the society we live in where children are thinking like that."" Ciaran is set to start counselling this week and is hoping it will help him. He also wants to be able to go back to the arena as he hopes to follow in his idol's footsteps and become a singer. Ms Turner believes finding help has been harder because the family don't live in Manchester. ""There are a lot of people affected all over the UK, probably outside of the UK. It shouldn't just be centred around Manchester; you have to cater for everybody. ""I can't even see him smile. All I want to do is see him smile again."" Dr Alistair Rennie coordinated the response to the bombing at two hospitals Emergency medicine consultantAlistair Rennieco-ordinated the response to the attack at Manchester Royal Infirmary and the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. After declaring a major incident, he worked for 24 hours without sleep, managing surgeons, liaising with the police and ambulance service. Dr Rennie, who describes his role as ""managing the shop floor"", said he was left deeply saddened by the deaths of three of the victims at the two hospitals. He said: ""We all train for this, and you can imagine having a bad bus crash or a train crash to deal with. On this occasion, what was even more emotive was that this had been planned. ""That was an emotional issue to deal with. You are treating people who have been targeted."" Dozens of staff answered the call to come into the hospitals, with some getting to work despite fearing for the safety of friends or loved ones at the arena. Dr Rennie said they were faced with what were effectively ""warzone"" injuries and, across Greater Manchester, 23 operating theatres worked through the night. With thoughts now turning to Tuesday's anniversary, Dr Rennie said it had remained ""very difficult"" for some staff to come to terms with the bombing. ""We are all human. Some have been quite badly affected, particularly some of those who dealt with children,"" he said. Twenty-two people were killed in the blast on 22 May Returning home to his young children, Dr Rennie said he was left ""fully aware"" of the loss and grief families had suffered. ""It was one of those moments of thinking 'my God, what are other people going through?'"" The hospitals will observe a minute's silence on Tuesday. At the children's hospital, this will be broken by singing from the Manchester Survivors Choir - something Dr Rennie fears could ""tip me into a crying, bubbling wreck"". However, he said the pressures of work would mean there won't be much time to spend in reflection. ""Life is very short,"" he said. ""We've got to live the best life we can for everyone."" Mark Robinson was photographed as he was helped from the area Mark Robinsontravelled to the concert from Leeds with his partner Eli and her two daughters. He was standing with Eli in the foyer about seven metres (23ft) away from Abedi at the time of the blast, and suffered shrapnel wounds and a perforated eardrum. ""The actual explosion, your brain cannot process fast enough what's gone on. You think you're in a dream, you're certainly not trained for what you see,"" he said. ""How can I describe the last year? It's like being at the edge of a pond with ripples keep coming towards you. The flashbacks that you have. ""I feel guilt for taking Eli and her girls there. Why was it that concert?"" Although he has recovered from his physical injuries, he said he was still affected by what happened that night. ""It doesn't stop overnight because your wounds heal,"" he explained, mentioning the regular blood tests to check for HIV and hepatitis he continues to undergo. However, he credits going back to work as something that has helped him. Manchester's St Ann's Square became a focal point for tributes following the attack ""My colleagues, the company I work for, they were absolutely fantastic and it's so humbling,"" he said. ""Life is so precious and it can be taken away in an instant. ""Walking the dog, listening to birdsong, rain on your face. Simple things that you appreciate. ""I am so so grateful that I have got my legs and arms and I was able to go back to work and carry on."" Mr Robinson and his partner will be attending the service at Manchester Cathedral. He said he was glad Prince William and Theresa May would be in attendance as it ""shows it's not forgotten in higher circles"". ""It's important to go and hopefully see the people who helped you. And to remember those who didn't make it."" Janet Sherret says her most important job is to get her daughter's sparkle back Janet Sherrettravelled to the gig with her daughterKaela, then aged 12. Mrs Sherret, from Fife, has since joined an online support group for survivors of the bombing. ""Living in Scotland, we felt kind of left out of it because obviously there was the Manchester Resilience Hub support group,"" she said. The past year has been ""like a recovery from everything"", Mrs Sherret says, and the emotional impact will ""remain there forever"". ""It puts a different slant on anywhere you go where there's a big crowd because you're on high alert. ""This is why it's the loss of innocence for my daughter. She never used to think like that and was her carefree self."" Manchester was awash with tributes following the attack Mrs Sherret has been left with separation anxiety when her daughter is not with her. ""I thought I was having to protect her with my life,"" she said. ""It's not something you come across every day."" She, too, has experienced feelings of guilt. ""You have this guilt that you took your child to something that you thought would be safe, as well as a survivor's guilt.""

Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens,"This video can not be played The inquiry has opened with tributes paid to those who died The father of a baby stillborn after his parents escaped the Grenfell Tower fire has spoken of his loss on the opening day of the public inquiry. Marcio Gomes was in tears as he recalled holding his son Logan, hoping it was a bad dream. The child was stillborn in hospital on 14 June 2017, hours after his parents fled the blaze. Relatives of all 72 victims will be given the chance to commemorate loved ones during the inquiry. The inquiry will look into all the deaths - including one victim who died in January, having been in hospital since the blaze. Five others were remembered on the inquiry's first day, which began with a 72-second silence in memory of those who died. They include artist Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, Denis Murphy, Joseph Daniels and Mohamed Neda. Families are being given as long as they want to tell the inquiry about their loved ones through a mixture of words, pictures and videos. The father described his son as the inquiry was shown this image of Logan Gomes Mr Gomes said ""everything was ready"" for his baby's arrival, including a message that had been painted on the nursery wall.  The inquiry was shown an ultrasound picture of Logan, who was due on 14 August but was born two months earlier. Listen: The Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast With his wife, Andreia, sat beside him, he said it had ""felt like our hearts had broken"". ""He was going to be my superstar,"" he added. One of Denis Murphy's ""proudest days"" was his son Peter's graduation form university, the inquiry was told The family of Denis Murphy told the inquiry ""the day he died a part of all of us died"". Joined by Mr Murphy's son, brother, and ex-wife, his sister Anne Marie said the last time they had spoken was at 02.32 during the fire, when she had told him they were on their way. She described her brother as ""our hero"" and the ""linchpin to our family"". Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? What happened at the tower block? Solicitors representing the family of Mohamed Neda read tributes from his brother, son, and wife. Farhad Neda said his father was his ""best friend and the man I admire most"". Both Farhad and his mother Flora were in a coma after the fire. ""My father and I were a great team together,"" he said. Mohamed Neda would get on with anybody, his family said ""Regardless of working a night shift he would not hesitate in coming home in the morning, picking me up, and driving me to (Taekwondo) competitions."" All the medals and photographs from these competitions were lost in the blaze, Farhad added. He described the ""deep pain"" at knowing his father would not be at his wedding or ever hold his grandchildren. ""He has left everyone with very happy memories. I have missed him so very much,"" he said. Mr Neda's wife of more than 27 years, Flora, said it had been ""love at first sight"". This video can not be played The inquiry heard the last phone message of fire victim Mohamed 'Saber' Neda The pair had arrived in the UK in 1998 after fleeing persecution in Afghanistan. ""Our hopes and our dreams have been shattered,"" she said. ""There is a heavy sense of loss within our hearts that will never, ever go away. He was my husband, my best friend. I miss him so much. He will always be the love of my life."" The inquiry was played an audio recording of the last call from Mr Neda from the night of the fire. In it, he said: ""We are now leaving this world, goodbye. I hope I haven't disappointed you."" Meanwhile,a BBC Panorama investigation has discovered that the insulation that burned out of control on the Grenfell Towerhad never passed the required safety test and should never have been on the building. The programme also accused the firm of mis-selling the insulation. Panorama has been advised that the way Celotex tested and sold the insulation could amount to corporate manslaughter. Celotex said it could not comment because it was co-operating with the police investigation and public inquiry. Grenfell insulation 'never passed fire test' ByBBC reporter Emma Harrison Barrister Kieran Mitchell said ""this horrific event has obliterated so many lives"" A respectful silence descended on the conference room as the tributes to those who lost their lives in Grenfell began. The first, father Marcio Gomes, grieving for his baby son Logan, wept as he recalled the excitement his wife's pregnancy had brought to his family. The family of Denis Murphy bowed their heads on stage as a tribute was read in honour of their ""hero"" father and brother. Around them in the audience - the bereaved, friends and family - showed their support with loud applause after the tributes. Some gave a standing ovation. Others were in tears. In the short breaks between tributes, those in the room hugged and consoled each other. Above all else there is a sense that the room of survivors and bereaved need answers. Answers they hope this inquiry will give them. The family of photographer Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy were joined on stage by Labour MP David Lammy. A statement from Khadija's cousin Marion, was read by the family solicitor. ""The pain is unbearable. There are no words to describe the emptiness in our hearts,"" she said. ""There will be two empty chairs at every birthday, Christmas and new year, but they will forever own a position in our hearts. We will carry their memories throughout our lives."" Marion described her aunt Mary as her ""hero"", the ""strong one, the fighter and protector"". A statement read on behalf of Khadija's father, Mohammadou Saye, talked about his daughter's passion for photography. ""Khadija said to me one day: 'Daddy, I'm in love with images.' It was this passion Khadija pursued to the end because it gave her great satisfaction and brought her some joy and some happiness."" A piece of film - part of a documentary filmed by the BBC about Khadija's work for an international art exhibition in Venice - was also shown to the inquiry. It included interviews filmed inside the Grenfell Tower flat where she lived. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower: BBC Three documentary of Khadija Saye shown at inquiry Joseph Daniels' son Sam asked for no applause after his short commemoration. ""My father moved to London in 1982 and Grenfell Tower was his only home since then,"" he said. ""The events of that night took his life and all trace of his existence from this world. He never stood a chance of getting out, it should never have happened."" Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire Campaigners 'won the argument' Opening the inquiry, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the fire was the ""greatest tragedy to befall this city"" since World War Two. He said the sight of the 24-storey tower ""engulfed in flames"" is ""indelibly imprinted"" on all who saw it. The retired judge said it was ""fitting"" the opening of the inquiry should be dedicated to those who died. All the victims' names will be read out at the hearings, taking place at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel in South Kensington, west London, but it is understood that not all families will give a tribute. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, said beginning the proceedings in this way will mean ""we will never lose sight of who our work is for and why we are doing it"".

This will take place at Holborn Bars in central London, where several procedural hearings have already taken place.

What can we expect from inquiry?,"This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is hearing from victims' families this week, nearly a year after a huge fire engulfed the west London tower block. The fire was reported at the 24-storey block in North Kensington at 00:54 BST on 14 June 2017. It started in a Hotpoint fridge freezeron the fourth floor. Police say it was not started deliberately. It took until 01:14 BST the following day to bring the fire under control, killing 72 people and destroying 151 homes, both inside the block and nearby. The fire's ""unexpected"" ferocity led to questions about the Â£8.6m refurbishment of the tower block, andin particular the cladding. Prime Minister Theresa Mayordered a full public inquirythe day after the fire. ""We need to know what happened, we need to have an explanation of this,"" she said at the time. The inquiry has been set up to determine three things: what happened, why, and what can be done to prevent anything similar happening again. There will be two phases of the inquiry: the first will examine how the blaze developed and the second will look at how the tower became exposed to the risk of a major fire. It is separate to any police investigation. A retired judge, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was chosen by the prime minister to lead the public inquiry in June 2017. He opened the inquiry exactly three months after the fireon 14 September 2017. At the time, he said: ""The inquiry process is not adversarial, it's not to punish anyone or award compensation. It's simply to get to the truth."" According to the inquiry, 547 individuals and organisationshave been granted core participant status,external. Sir Martin is supported bya team of 35 people,external, including a legal team, civil servants and three assessors. Nine expert witnesses have so far been announced, focusing on the spread of the fire, the regulation of the building, the fire brigade's role and the impact of gas and water supplies to the building. By March, some 267,000 documentswere received and reviewed,externalby the inquiry. Survivors have pushed hard for more diversity on the inquiry panel Many of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire wereunhappy with the choice of Sir Martin. As a former judge, he was considered too ""establishment"" and out of step with the sentiments of the local community. Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said they feared the inquiry would be a ""whitewash"". Critics were also angry atSir Martin's refusal to appoint a person from the Grenfell communityto an advisory panel that will consider the evidence with him. More than 156,000 peoplesigned a petition,externalcalling for individuals from a range of backgrounds to sit on a panel. Following pressure from victims' families, the prime minister agreed on 11 May thattwo experts will sit with Sir Martin in phase two of the inquiry. All the families of those who died. They have been invited to take part in the inquiry as ""core participants"". They will receive all the relevant evidence in advance of the hearing and can suggest lines of questioning that they would like to see pursued. The inquirywill also hear from survivors, Grenfell residents, firefighters and expert witnesses. Sir Martin has faced hostility from the bereaved and survivors of the Grenfell Tower On 16 November 2017, officials said71 victims of the fire had been identified, including baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital after the fire. However, the deaths of 72 people will be looked at by the inquiry, including Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January 2018. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Nine days of commemoration hearings began on Monday, 21 May with a 72-second silence for the victims. Organisers say it is ""an opportunity for the families of those who lost their lives in the fire to provide a tribute of them for the inquiry record"". The first tribute on the opening day of the inquirywas from the father of a baby stillborn after his parents escaped the blaze. Five others were also remembered on the first day. The inquiry is then scheduled to hear from its firstexpert witnesses on 18 June.,external Evidence from firefighterswho worked on the scene will be heard in late June and early July. Survivors, the bereaved and local residents are set to give their evidence at the beginning of September. Closing statements of phase one of the inquiry are not expected until the end of October. The second phase is not expected to begin until the new year when Sir Martin will be joined by the two additional panel members, who have yet to be named. Part two of the inquiry will focus on the construction, refurbishment and management of the building prior to the fire. After the inquiry has heard all of the relevant evidence, Sir Martin will prepare a report for the prime minister, who has promised to publish the findings in full.

Manchester remembers arena bomb victims,"This video can not be played The day of remembrance included a national minute's silence An emotional memorial service marking the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack has been held. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds injured when a bomb was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined families of victims at the Manchester Cathedral service. The Dean of Manchester said it was for ""those whose lives were lost and those whose lives have been changed forever"". It was broadcast to the crowds outside in Cathedral Gardens on a giant screen.

He was followed by short addresses from a number of faith leaders, including Nidhi Sinha, Rabbi Warren Elf, Imam Irfan Chishti and Sukhbir Singh, and from humanist Dr Kevin Malone. The Duke of Cambridge joined political leaders and the families of the victims at the service Twenty-two candles were lit in Manchester Cathedral for the victims A crowd also gathered in St Ann's Square, where tributes were laid a year ago It also saw a bible reading from the Duke of Cambridge and performances from the Manchester Cathedral Choir and the Halle Youth Choir, who sang a rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.

Two women hugged each other for support as two giant silver 22 balloons fluttered above them in the wind, while a teenage girl sobbed as photos of the victims were shown on a giant screen. Tears rolled down a man's face behind his sunglasses, as he struggled to control his emotions. And as the Dean of Manchester announced the minute's silence, the whole crowd rose as one. Police officers, firefighters, teens in Ariana Grande T-shirts and pensioners bowed their heads together and two men dressed in bee costumes stood next to a man waving an anti-IS banner.

Clean air plan 'ambitious but vague',"Plans to tackle sources of air pollution - such as wood-burning stoves - put too much responsibility on local councils, critics say. The government, as part of its clean air strategy, wants to clamp down on all sources of pollution, including coal-burning and ammonia from farms. Campaigners welcome the consultation, but say it does not go far enough. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it would be ""disproportionate"" to have a uniform ban on certain fuels. He said the air pollution effects in rural areas of fuels, such as diesel or coal, are significantly less compared to urban areas as they are dispersed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: ""What we've got here are a series of proportionate measures which we hope will deal with what is a big public health issue."" UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed UK faces European court over dirty air Ministers want to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of pollution from fine particles, known as particulates, by 2025. One of the most contentious proposals is to reduce pollution from wood burners, which, along with solid fuels, cause 38% of particulate pollution. But a source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC there was no plan to ban existing stoves - or the burning of coal and open wood fires, which are far more polluting than wood burners. Sorry, your browser does not support this tool Source: MappAir100 by EarthSense If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhere,externalto reload the page. Farmers, who have largely evaded pollution controls so far, will be told to buy new equipment to reduce airborne ammonia from slurry. The government has been obliged to publish this Clean Air Strategy under an EU rule. It's in addition to the law which has seen the UK taken to court over high levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution. The new legislation would not ban existing wood-burning stoves. However, any new stoves that are sold would have to be cleaner People would be encouraged to burn dry seasoned wood, which emits fewer particulates than wet wood Councils would be given new powers, such as limiting what people can burn or introducing ""no-burn days"" But there is not expected to be a ban on the sale of wet wood, which typically come from garage forecourts Ministers estimate that their plans will reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated Â£1 billion every year by 2020, rising to Â£2.5 billion every year from 2030. They describe air pollution as the fourth biggest threat to public health after cancer, obesity and heart disease. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains - air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment. ""This clean air strategy sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of the government to improve air quality."" All EU nations will have to submit similar plans to cut pollution but Mr Gove says the UK's policies will be carried out beyond Brexit. This video can not be played Michael Gove told Today ""conventional cars"" will be banned by 2040 The legislation will give new powers to local councils so they can solve pollution hotspots. Some councils welcome this approach whilst others think they're being left to do the government's dirty work. Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association said: ""If we're to truly tackle air pollution, we need government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission vehicles and power generation."" Green groups are pleased that the plan will be embedded in new primary legislation - and they applaud the decision to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of particulates. But they say the document so far doesn't say how the government will deal with the on-going problem of NOX emissions from cars. And they accuse it of loading too much work on to local councils. Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""The ambition is impressive - but how is it going to be achieved? Lots of councils simply don't have the resources to deal with these issues."" He said the proposal on wood burners was far too vague: ""Will hard-pressed environmental health officers really be checking on wet wood in forecourts?"" he asked. Sue Hayman MP, Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, said: ""Michael Gove has become the Secretary of State for Consultations - with over 25 consultations published by his department since the General Election and not a single piece of primary legislation brought forward."" Farmers will be supported to cut ammonia emissions through the proposednew farming funding system known as public money for public goods. One technologically-difficult issue is also acknowledged - the contribution to microplastic air pollution and water pollution from vehicle brakes and tyres wearing on the road. The government says it will work with international partners to research and develop new standards. Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Do you have any questions about tackling air pollution?

"Bercow admits muttering word 'stupid'Speaker John Bercow says he respects all his colleagues, including Commons leader Andrea Leadsom.8h8 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow admits muttering 'stupid' 'as an aside' Commons Speaker John Bercow has said he ""respects all his colleagues"" after admitting using the word ""stupid"" during Commons exchanges. He said he used the word, reported to have been directed at Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, as a ""muttered aside"". He told MPs he had the highest regard for Mrs Leadsom's ""political ability and personal character"". But he said he would continue to speak openly and, at times, ""disagree"" with ministers on their Commons management. Mr Bercow has faced calls to apologise amid reports he used the phrase ""stupid woman"" in connection with Commons leader Mrs Leadsom during a row over the scheduling of a government statement on the nationalisation of the East Coast rail franchise last week. Commons Speaker facing new outburst claims In an unscheduled statement to MPs on Monday as Mrs Leadsom was about to take part in a debate, Mr Bercow said he believed the timetabling of government business had been ""badly handled"" on the day by the government. The decision to announce such a major development on the same day as Labour debates on Grenfell and Brexit was ""disrespectful"" to MPs wanting to speak on those issues, he said. Explaining what had happened, he said: ""Having expressed my displeasure on the matter quite forcefully from the chair, I used the word stupid in a muttered aside. ""The adjective simply summed up how I felt about the way that the day's business had been conducted."" He said he ""loved this place"" and held all his colleagues in the ""highest esteem"", adding: ""Anyone who knows the leader of the house at all well will not have the slightest doubt about her political ability and personal character."" Speaking later, Mrs Leadsom said she was committed to treating all her colleagues with courtesy and respect and expected the same pleasantries to be shown to all members. ""I take my responsibilities to this House very seriously. As you said last week Mr Speaker, we have a responsibility to safeguard the rights of this House.""

Turkey to jail 104 coup suspects for lifeThe president had said he backed reintroducing the death penalty for plotters of the 2016 coup.10m11 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Mr Erdogan addressed an Istanbul crowd a year after the failed coup A Turkish court has sentenced 104 former military officers to life in prison for their involvement in a 2016 coup attempt, state media report. They were given ""aggravated life sentences"", which come with tougher terms than a normal life sentence. The country's president had previously said he backed reintroducing the death penalty for coup plotters. The failed coup to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan left at least 260 dead and 2,200 injured on 15 July 2016. The Turkish government has since led a crackdown on alleged coup supporters, with the dismissal of more than 150,000 state employees and the arrest of some 50,000 people. A brief guide to Turkey's coup In Pictures: Battle on Bosphorus Bridge Of the 280 ex-military people on trial, the court in Izmir also served lesser sentences to a further 52 defendants. Sitting in Izmir in western Turkey, the court gave 21 people 20 years in prison for ""assisting the assassination of the president"", while 31 others were sentenced to between seven and 11 years for ""membership of a terrorist organisation"", state news agency Anadolu reported. President Erdogan had backed reintroducing the death penalty for coup plotters. He also said they should wear Guantanamo Bay-style uniforms. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004. The Turkish authorities accused a movement loyal to the Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of organising the 2016 plot. Mr Gulen, who has been in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999, denies any involvement, and Washington has so far resisted calls from the Turkish authorities to extradite him. Nearly 500 on trial over Turkey coup plot Turkey suspends 9,000 police in crackdown Why Turkish stability matters to the region and beyond Rebel soldiers had attempted to overthrow the government overnight and plotters tried to detain Mr Erdogan as he holidayed in an Aegean resort. However, he had left 15 minutes before and the coup was thwarted by civilians and soldiers loyal to the president. A purge followed the coup, in which thousands of public employees from police officers to teachers were sacked or arrested under suspicion of stirring up dissent. Mr Erdogan's critics say he is using the purge to stifle political dissent.
