Jon Snow bows out of Channel 4 News after 32 years,"Jon Snow (front, seated) and the rest of the Channel 4 News team on his last day Jon Snow has presented his final edition of Channel 4 News after 32 years at the helm of the programme. The 74-year-old, one of the UK's longest-serving TV news presenters, described the role as the ""greatest privilege of my life"". Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among those who paid tribute to Snow, calling him a ""British institution"". After a clip featuring some of his best moments, Snow was cheered out of the newsroom by his colleagues. Co-presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy described Snow as ""the most energetic, enthusiastic, committed and questioning TV journalist, who brought compassion and humanity to his reporting whether in the studio, war or disaster zone"". He added: ""It is no wonder viewers love him or that politicians who get angry with his questions respect him. His last day has been an emotional one for the whole newsroom. We knew it was coming, but can't quite believe it's happening now."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cathy Newman, another Channel 4 News presenter,wrote on Twitter,externalthat appearing alongside Snow had been ""the privilege of my life"". The programme's editor Ben De Pear said: ""It's been an honour for all of us to work with Jon, not just for his outstanding journalism but because he's a wonderful person and friend and example to all of us as to how to report a story and also care about what it means. ""He's the heart and soul of Channel 4 News and we all love him."" The credits at the end of the programme paid tribute to Snow When Snow's departure was announced in April, Channel 4 said Snow would now ""front longer-form projects... and represent the channel in other matters"". He will now ""focus on his charities and some of his many passions in life, people's stories, inequality, Africa, Iran and the arts"", according to the channel. Snow joined Channel 4 News after serving as ITN's Washington correspondent and diplomatic editor in the 1980s. As well as being a fixture in the nightly programme's London studio, the job has taken him around the world to report on stories including the fall of the Berlin Wall, the release of Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama's inauguration. The programme has won 10 Bafta TV awards during his tenure, while Snow received Bafta's Richard Dimbleby Award for the best factual contribution to television in 2005, and the Bafta Fellowship - the organisation's highest accolade - in 2015. His other honours include 10 Royal Television Society awards, including six for presenter of the year. Speaking about the response to his journalism over the years, Snow told The Media Show: ""Because I'm tall and have funny ties, people are terribly nice to me in the street and you get this feedback and that's wonderful. ""You do get a sense of why people watch and it's not just me, we're a team, and we're different from other options. Obviously I'm going to miss that."" Snow's last show featured tributes from a range of high-profile figures, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. Mr Brown described him as a ""British institution"" while Sir Trevor said Snow ""wanted to be where the story was every time - every day, every week"". Mrs Sturgeon said Snow's absence would leave a ""massive hole"", and Mr Rees-Mogg described the broadcaster as a ""completely fair"" interviewer, adding ""you knew you had to be on your toes with Jon"". Bowing out of his last programme, Snow said his role had been the ""greatest privilege of my life"" before he was cheered out of the newsroom by colleagues. The BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet shared aphoto of herself and Jon Snow on Twitter,external. The photo shows Doucet and a team of colleagues, dressed in safety gear in Gaza, with a smiling Snow: ""JonsnowC4 stopped us - ""an all-women team!"" He asked for a photo .. or was it us asking him? #JonSnow,"" BBC economics editor Faisal Islam, who previously worked with Snow at Channel 4 News,tweeted,externalthat his former colleague was a ""simply superb colleague, fearless & relentless interrogator of truth"". Piers Morgan added his tributeon Twitter,external, writing: ""You've been a consistently brilliant news broadcaster, and aside from the ludicrous ties, and dodgy helmets, a lot of fun too. Congrats on a great run."" The programme's remaining team of presenters includes Guru-Murthy, Newman, Matt Frei and Jackie Long. In 2018, Snow took a 25% cut to his salary to help reduce the gender pay gap. In March, he revealed he had become a father for the third time. Snowtold BBC Radio 4's Media Show last weekthat his departure would be ""like leaving a marriage"". ""You're all interdependent in so many ways in the workplace, and you see each other day after day, week after week, year after year,"" he said. ""Obviously it's a big wrench.""

'It should be the same rules across the UK',"Paul Slater said being on the border highlights ""confusion"" when rules are brought in Covid restrictions should be the same in every nation, says a landlord whose pub straddles the border between England and Wales. Paul Slater took over the Trotting Mare Inn in Knolton just weeks before the first lockdown in 2020 and said ""nothing has been straightforward"". The pub itself is in Wrexham County, north Wales, so will face new restrictions from 26 December. Its car park is in Shropshire, England. Being on the border highlights confusion when rules are brought in, he said. ""With me being on the border... customers come in and they don't understand that we are in Wales and it is a different law to England so I think it would add to the clarity if the nations all came together and did the same thing,"" he said. From Boxing Day, groups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with pubs to offer table service only and collect contact tracing details. Covid: Rising numbers of NHS staff off work Pubs fear crippling rules Six people allowed to meet in pubs It comes after the number of identified Omicron cases in Wales grew by 204 on Tuesday to 640. A planned New Year's Eve Party at the Trotting Mare Inn has been cancelled and arrangements for a 60th birthday party for Boxing Day have had to be changed. People have suggested setting up a marquee in the car park to make the most of English rules, but that is not possible due to the positioning of the car access, Mr Slater said. Pubs, he said, rely on takings from December to help them through the quieter months of January and February but, without that cushion or any financial support, many may have to ""look at closing for an amount of time or limiting their hours"". ""The pubs aren't getting enough notice with all these changes, they could change again next week,"" he said, ""We just want clarification really of what is going on almost long term, I know the politicians and scientists don't know long term but it would just be nice to have a little bit more notice of what is going on because it could change again in a couple of days."" Mark Jones runs the Stanton House Inn with wife Chelly Mark Jones, at the Stanton House Inn, Chirk, in Wrexham, has just recovered from Covid-19 and said after having the virus he can understand restrictions coming in. But the move will ""hinder"" the business which is half a mile from the border with England, he said, and added having differing restrictions in businesses just minutes away has an impact on trade. ""It has been very quiet in the build up to Christmas, the government is telling people not to mix and they are listening but trade-wise it is just like ordinary days, I can't believe it is Christmas on Saturday,"" he said. ""It is as bad as last year when we were shut down but now we're not getting the grants."" Having to police the new restrictions also creates problems for the business at a time when they are understaffed due to workers having to isolate themselves, he said. ""They might as well shut us down now down and open us up when it is right to do so and we don't have to follow the rules."" Stanton House is in Chirk, Wrexham, close to the border with Shropshire John Matthews, 63, has run The Dukes Arms in Presteigne, a town classed as Powys but which is near the border with Herefordshire, for 32 years. ""With the way things are doing there won't be a 33rd,"" he said. He said trade has already dropped in the pub with people ""frightened to death"" over the latest news surrounding coronavirus. John Matthews said Christmas is going to be a ""disaster"" ""Christmas going to be a disaster,"" he said. ""In the pub I've got three fires going and only three customers. ""Usually Christmas Eve and New Years Eve we are absolutely packed, but I think we might just have a handful because a lot of people aren't coming out, the majority of customers are going to stay home, and that's the reality."" Mr Matthews said abiding to the new rules will be ""another expense"". ""We have to get all the Perspex again, all the signage, do this track and trace, but we don't get any assistance at all off the government..it is totally ridiculous,"" he added. ""For young licensees, the young people working behind bars, they are going to suffer far more, job wise and that.""

Men behind largest Covid loan fraud jailed,"The two men laundered Â£70m police said Two men have been jailed for a total of 33 years for running a Â£70m money laundering scheme, Â£10m of which came from fraudulent Covid loans. Artem Terzyan, 38, from Russia and Deivis Grochiatskij, 44, from Lithuania were sentenced earlier this month at Kingston Crown Court. Police believe the Bounce Back Loan fraud was one of the largest since the scheme started in 2020. At present, police have recovered only Â£17,000, with most money sent abroad. Details of the case can be reported after court restrictions were lifted. The two men were first arrested in 2018 following a police operation which started the year before. Police officers from the National Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police watched large bags of cash being carried into their East London flats that had been picked up in lorry parks and service stations. Both men, plus other members of their criminal network, opened bank accounts in the names of various fake companies they had set up, the NCA said. The money was then sent from one shell company to another ""in a complex web of transfers"", before being sent to accounts in Germany, the Czech Republic, U.A.E, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Deivis Grochiatskij helped set up money laudering shell companies used in the loan fraud While on bail after their 2018 arrest, the men started fraudulently claiming Bounce Back Loans in 2020 for the various shell companies they had set up. The loans were part of government measures designed to cushion the UK economy from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. They claimed up to Â£50,000 a time, generating over Â£10m in total, with Â£3.2m claimed from one UK bank alone. Sentencing the two men, High Court judge Rajeev Shetty said their Bounce Back Loan fraud played a part in ""undermining the government and financial institutions"" and that the ""the British taxpayer will be staggered and upset that part of their hard-earned tax contributions was going into the pockets of criminals"". At Kingston Crown Court, Terzyan was sentenced to 17 years in prison and Grochiatskij to 16 years after being convicted following a trial. Andy Tickner, from the Organised Crime Partnership, said the pair had built ""a sophisticated, large-scale money laundering system"". ""They did so by setting up hundreds of bogus companies and utilising an international network of criminals under their control,"" he added. ""To top it off, they stole over Â£10m from British taxpayers in what is believed to be one of the largest Bounce Back Loan frauds since the scheme was introduced in 2020. ""These men and their network played a vital role in enabling other criminals to conceal and access their illicit earnings. ""The removal of this service will have been a massive blow to organised criminals in the UK and globally."" Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate Hunting down the Covid loan fraudsters.

Two more Premier League games postponed,"The Premier League has postponed Liverpool's game against Leeds United and the match between Wolves and Watford because of coronavirus. Both games were at 12:30 GMT on Sunday, 26 December but have been called off after requests from Leeds and Watford. The Premier League said Leeds could not play ""due to the number of players with Covid-19, injuries and illness"". Everton boss Rafael Benitez said he was ""surprised"" his side's game at Burnley was still on. The Toffees last played on 16 December when they drew 1-1 with Chelsea, prior to their match on 19 December against Leicester City being postponed because of Covid-19 cases within the Foxes camp. EFL matches postponed because of Covid-19 This video can not be played Everton boss Rafael Benitez ""surprised"" Burnley game is going ahead ""After the game [against Chelsea] we found that we have five positives,"" said Benitez. ""With the injuries and the positives that we had, we were expecting that the game would be postponed like in a lot of games. ""Now I have to think if I have 11 players fit and where I can put them. I am really surprised we are playing this game."" The Spaniard added he had nine fit outfield players, three goalkeepers and five youngsters for the match, and that he may be forced to include forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin after four months out with injury. ""It's a massive risk to the players and not fair,"" said Benitez. Watford have had games against Burnley, Crystal Palace and Wolves postponed because of a Covid-19 outbreak. A Premier League statement read: ""Watford continue to have an insufficient number of players to field a team after their game against Crystal Palace last Saturday was postponed following a Covid-19 outbreak. ""Due to players coming out of isolation, it is fully expected Watford will be available for their fixture on Tuesday 28 December, against West Ham United."" This video can not be played Jordan Henderson: Liverpool captain says player welfare ""not taken seriously enough"" Leeds said there had been ""five new positive Covid-19 cases within the first-team squad and staff"" and they have closed their training ground. The Elland Road club added: ""All of the cases we have experienced are asymptomatic which we believe is due to our high vaccine take-up. ""The positive cases, combined with our well documented injury issues, means that we would not have enough recognised first-team players to meet the Premier League requirements for the fixture. ""The training ground at Thorp Arch will be closed for a period of two days on the advice of Public Health England."" The two latest postponements mean there have been 12 top-flight games called off because of an increase in coronavirus cases. The most recent round of testing of top-flight players and staff revealed a record 90 positive tests, butPremier League clubs decidedon Monday to not make any changes to the festive schedule. At the meeting, clubs were advised that if they have 13 fit players, plus a goalkeeper, they should fulfil their games. Amid the rise in cases, Liverpool and England midfielderJordan Henderson told BBC Sporthe was ""concerned"" that ""nobody really takes player welfare seriously"". Meanwhile, managers met with the Premier League on Thursday to discuss issues around the Covid-19 pandemic. BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone: The Premier League has pledged to continue dialogue with its managers and captains after meeting the groups for the first time since the start of the season on Thursday. It is understood well-publicised concerns around the fixture calendar were aired, although the club owners had already decided to continue the season without a pause earlier this week. A number of managers have publicly stated their desire to return to five substitutes, which was implemented in the top flight within Project Restart but then dropped following a vote of the clubs before the 2020-21 season. The matter has been discussed on a number of occasions since without reaching the required 14-club threshold for it to be passed. Any club can bring a proposal to a shareholders meeting. The next official meeting is not scheduled to be held until February but given the uncertainty over the league, it is almost certain there will be discussions between the clubs before then. Two matches have already been postponed on Boxing Day and the league is realistic about more being called off given pre-game PCR tests and matchday lateral flow tests will still need to be conducted. While the Premier League has pledged to make early decisions on matches where possible, in the latter case, this is exceptionally difficult given the timescales involved.

"Energy bills set to rise by 50%, industry warns","Energy bills will soar another 50% next year unless the government intervenes, the industry has warned. Supplier EDF said the situation was ""critical"" as customers, already seeing record bills, are hit with more rises due to surging wholesale gas prices. Emma Pinchbeck, head of trade body Energy UK, said rising prices were now starting to hurt the economy. The government said it had measures to protect consumers, but she told the BBC tax cuts and green levies would help. Why are gas prices so high? Rising energy bills: 'Penny-pinching and duvets to keep warm' Other European governments, also hit by the global rise in energy costs, were doing more, Ms Pinchbeck said. ""We've had record-breaking gas prices since September, and over the last couple of weeks prices have spiked again,"" she said. ""They are at levels that, frankly, we have not seen before. ""It's looking pretty serious for the spring. Domestic energy bills are going to go up 45-50%."" Wholesale costs hit another record this week of 450p a therm, which experts predict could take average annual bills to about Â£2,000 next year. Ms Pinchbeck said that across Europe, governments were asking energy-intensive commercial users to curb demand from factories in order to make savings and ease the knock-on impact. ""We are asking our Treasury to intervene as other governments have. When it comes to bills, it's worth remembering that less than a fifth is in the control of suppliers,"" she said. Many other governments across Europe have reduced taxes and other levies, and similar action could save close to Â£200 a year on an average bill, she said. These countries include Spain, which has extended a series of tax cuts brought in last June until May 2022. ""The price is now so high that this affects the whole of the economy. So does the Treasury need to do more? They have been reluctant to intervene so far in the bits that are within their control,"" she said. Philippe Commaret, a managing director at EDF, the UK's fourth-biggest supplier, said: ""We urge government to act now to support energy customers. The situation is critical this winter and unfortunately, this is only the beginning. ""The increase in the price cap in April could be as much as Â£700, and by next October, the cap could easily exceed Â£2,000 - that is, twice as much as the levels seen last winter."" If you think your gas and electricity bills are high now - just wait. That's the message coming from the energy industry. The cost of gas on the wholesale markets - where providers buy what they need - has been rocketing in recent weeks. It has more than doubled since early November. A swathe of suppliers has already gone out of business as a result. Ofgem can hold back the tide for vulnerable consumers for a bit with its price cap but it is just delaying the inevitable. Even capped bills will rise dramatically next year. The problem is, the market simply wasn't designed to deal with this kind of situation. That's why calls for the government to step in are growing louder by the day. Consumers have been shielded from the full increase in wholesale costs by the price cap, a limit on domestic rises set by the regulator Ofgem. The cap is next due to change in April. Many in the industry blame the cap for problems in the sector. More than two dozen energy suppliers have gone bust since the start of September, putting thousands of people out of work and leaving millions of homes in limbo as they wait for a new supplier. These failed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers and which because of its sizewas put ""special administration"", where it is run by Ofgem. The cap is set every six months. As gas prices have soared this year, it has forced suppliers to provide energy to households at eye-watering losses. Industry regulator Ofgem has proposed a series of short and long-term solutions to the issues that the price cap causes in extreme circumstances. These include reviewing the price cap every three months or overhauling it in favour of a six-month fixed tariff. A government spokesperson said: ""The Energy Price Cap is insulating millions of customers from record increases in global gas prices and will remain in place, and at the same rate, this winter. ""We continue to support those most in need through our Â£500m Household Support Fund, the Warm Home Discount and Winter Fuel Payments."" Next year the government will publish an updated Energy Retail Market Strategy, once the market has stabilised, to ensure the market is working in the best interests of consumers, the spokesperson said. Last week, the governor of the Bank of England warned that a recent further spike in wholesale gas prices would help drive UK inflation to about 6% early next year. The inflation rate is already at a 10-year high of 5.1%. How much are energy bills going up?

Nightclubs in Scotland to close for three weeks,"Nightclubs in Scotland are to close for at least three weeks from 27 December. It comes after fresh restrictions were put on large events and hospitality venues earlier this week due to concern over the Omicron variant. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said a new law would require nightclubs to close rather than have them try to enforce 1m distancing between customers. He said funding would be made available to support affected businesses. Mr Swinney said nightclubs would have the option to stay open by effectively becoming a bar - but physical distancing and table service would need to be in place. He said: ""We consider that closure in regulations, combined with financial support, may reduce losses and help these businesses weather what we hope will be a short period until they are able to operate normally again."" People in Scotland have not been told to cancel their Christmas plans, but have been urged to stay at home as much as possible throughout the rest of the festive period and to limit any gatherings to three households. Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains How is Scotland's booster rollout progressing? Mr Swinney told MSPs that there had been a ""rapid acceleration of cases driven by the Omicron variant"" in recent weeks, with concerns that the faster-spreading strain could overwhelm health services - despite early evidence that fewer people are needing hospital treatment than with other variants. The deputy first minister said ""we have to reduce dramatically the level of social interaction if we want to interrupt the circulation of Omicron"". Nightclubs were only allowed to reopen in August, having been shut for longer than almost every other sector during the pandemic, and had been subject tovaccine certification rulessince October. The Scottish Conservatives said closing them again was ""a further setback to a sector already on its knees"". MSP Murdo Fraser said: ""I understand that this is a fast-moving situation, but when announcing this enforced shutdown, John Swinney should have spelt out the exact details of the support package that will be given to nightclub businesses,. ""The SNP government has been given an extra Â£440m in assistance from the UK government. They need to get that money out the door and into the hands of beleaguered Scottish businesses immediately."" The Scottish Premiership has brought forward its winter break to limit the number of matches being played without supporters National clinical director Jason Leitch said the decision to close nightclubs took account of typically younger crowds who may not be vaccinated. Speaking to the BBC'sLunchtime Liveprogramme, he said: ""The thing that really scares us about this [variant] is its attack rate. That's why you can hear our tone and our fear rising a little. ""It's one of the reasons nightclubs have unfortunately had to be closed down. That population tends to be slightly less protected - not because they're not actually coming forward in big numbers but because it's taken us a bit longer to get to that age group. And it's an environment in which the virus enjoys."" He added that Omicron spreads particularly quickly in unventilated, crowded and indoor places, meaning there were concerns around transportation, homes, pubs and other hospitality venues. However, Donald MacLeod, owner of the Cathouse and Garage nightclubs in Glasgow, accused the Scottish government of ""scaremongering"" and ""ignoring""evidence which suggests Omicron is milder than other variants. He also said he had not heard any details on when promised government funding would be available to businesses. ""It's certainly not going to be in place before Christmas,"" he said. ""This is a nightmare before Christmas for all manner of businesses - ever since Public Health Scotland went rogue two weeks ago and scared everybody off the streets, the economy has been sliding in a vortex ring of doom and gloom. ""And nobody is putting their hands up saying how are we responsible for this? This is disgraceful, this is no way to run an industry never mind a country. It's contemptuous."" Ross: Scotland 'too cautious' on self-isolation New restrictions on public events will come into force on Boxing Day, limiting outdoor events to 500 people - meaning large Hogmanay events have been cancelled, and football matches will be played in effectively empty stadiums. The Scottish Premiership has already decided to start its winter break after Sunday's matches rather than on 3 January to avoid playing more matches without fans. Indoor events will be limited to 200 people seated, or 100 standing, and hospitality premises will have to return to table service while enforcing physical distancing between different groups of customers. Mr Swinney told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that talks had been held with industry representatives about how this could realistically be enforced in nightclubs, and said fresh regulations would be laid requiring them to ""not operate as such for this three week period"". The rules - which will affect about 150 clubs - will come into effect from 05:00 on 27 December, and will be reviewed three weeks later on 11 January. He said the government was ""acutely aware"" of the financial impact on firms, saying details of a Â£375m support package would be set out shortly. Finance Secretary Kate Forbestold MSPs,externalon Thursday that some of the cash was being ""repurposed"" from the health portfolio, ""to directly support public health compliance via business restrictions and self-isolation"". Scottish ministers have also called on the UK government to ramp up financial backing for businesses, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying ""a targeted furlough scheme"" should be introduced for the most-affected sectors.

TikTok ousts Google to be top online destination,"Move over Google, TikTok is the world's new most popular online destination. The viral video app gets more hits than the American search engine, according to Cloudflare, an IT security company. The rankings show that TikTok knocked Google off the top spot in February, March and June this year, and has held the number one position since August. Last year Google was first, and a number of sites including TikTok, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix were all in the top 10. Cloudfare said it tracks data using its toolCloudflare Radar,,externalwhich monitors web traffic. It is believed one of the reasons for the surge in Tiktok's popularity is because of the Covid pandemic, as lockdowns meant people were stuck at home and looking for entertainment. By July this year, TikTok had been downloaded more than three billion times, according to data company Sensor Tower. The social network, which is owned by a Chinese company called Bytedance, now has more than one billion active users across the world, and that number continues to grow. In China, to comply with the country's censorship rules, the app is called Douyin, and runs on a different network. Douyin was originally released in September 2016. This year, China ruled that users under the age of 14 would be limited to 40 minutes a day on the platform. TikTok was launched internationally in 2018, after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, an app which allowed users to share videos of themselves lip-synching to songs. The social media platform is no stranger to controversy. In 2019, it garnered a temporary ban in India, a US counter-intelligence investigation and a record Â£4.3m fine after Musical.ly was found to have knowingly hosted content published by under-age users. As one of the only internationally successful Chinese apps, politicians and regulators outside China have raised concerns about security and privacy. Last year TikTok was forced to deny it is controlled by the Chinese government. Theo Bertram, TikTok's head of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said it would refuse any request from China to hand over data. The app hosts a variety of short videos, covering genres such as comedy, dance and politics. In the UK, the most popular creator is make-up artist @abbyroberts with 17.4 million followers. This year @Francis.Bourgeois, with 1.6 million followers, quit his job to become a full-time trainspotter as a result of his viral videos at railway stations talking about trains and cheering them as they pass. Food and recipe videos have become a key part of TikTok's success, with viral clips getting millions of views. As a result, in the US, a new food delivery service called TikTok Kitchen will launch in March, allowing people to order dishes originally created in viral videos. The menu will be based on the app's most viral food trends and will include courses like the baked feta pasta which was ranked the most searched dish of 2021 by Google. TikTok Kitchen is being co-founded by Robert Earl, who owns the US food outlets Planet Hollywood, Buca di Beppo and Bertucci's. He said about 300 TikTok restaurants are planned across the country for the launch, with more than 1,000 expected by the end of 2022. TikTok Kitchen will operate out of many of the restaurants belonging to the chains owned by Mr Earl.

Charles and Camilla to join Queen for Christmas,"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will be with the Queen on Christmas Day, Clarence House has said. It comes after Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had cancelled spending Christmas at Sandringham, Norfolk, amid concerns about the rising levels of the Omicron variant. Instead, she will spend the day in Windsor, as she did last year. The palace said it was a personal decision and ""reflects a precautionary approach"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will spend Christmas in Norfolk and will be joined by some members of the Middleton family, a Kensington Palace spokesman said. The Queen cancels spending Christmas in Sandringham Queen cancels pre-Christmas family lunch Last week the Queen announced that she would not be going ahead with her pre-Christmas family lunch. That was also in response to worries about the spread of the new Covid variant. Since then, the UK has seen daily Covid case figures surge, with more than 100,000 cases announced for the first time on Wednesday. A Christmas tree at Windsor Castle During the autumn, the Queen had to withdraw from a series of public events, including the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and the Remembrance Sunday service, because of health concerns. But the latest change of plan has been in response to the rapid spread of the new highly mutated variant - amid calls for people to limit contacts during the Christmas festivities. It will mean missing her traditional family gathering at her Norfolk estate and her attendance at the Christmas morning service at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has announced that a service of thanksgiving for the life of the Duke of Edinburgh will be held in the spring. Prince Philip, the Queen's husband of 74 years, died in April, aged 99. It is understood the guest list for the Westminster Abbey service will include family, friends, dignitaries and representatives of organisations the duke was associated with. It comes as the six-month-old daughter of theDuke and Duchess of Sussexhas been seen for the first time in a publicly released photograph. Prince Harry and Meghan included an image of Lilibet on their festive card, which has been sent by email through the couple's Archewell charity. The photograph shows Meghan raising her daughter in the air as she sits alongside Prince Harry, who is holding their two-year-old son Archie on his knee. The photo was taken by Alexi Lubomirski this summer at the couple's home in Santa Barbara, California. The message on the card reads: ""Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie & Lili"". It also highlights the donations the couple have made to US organisations that help families ""from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave"". The picture on the card was shared on the Twitter account of Team Rubicon, one of the organisations supported by the couple, as well as on Alexi Lubomirski's social media accounts.

Omicron peak could see 'one in six' NHS staff off,"Retired NHS staff may be asked to return to work, and pre-planned treatments could be delayed About one in six NHS Wales staff may be off work at peak of the Omicron wave, its new chief executive has said. Judith Paget said modelling suggested up to 17% of staff could be ill or self-isolating during January. If this happens, she said retired healthcare staff could be drafted in to assist with other essential services. The NHS would also have to prioritise the most urgent care and that would have a further detrimental effect on pre-planned treatments. ""Urgent and emergency care, cancer care, mental health support would be in that top list of things that we would focus our efforts on,"" said Ms Paget. ""I think it's inevitable that, in some way across Wales, planned care and other services will be affected, whilst we make sure that we protect our population as best we can."" Record NHS waiting times in Wales for 18th month Welsh NHS backlog could take years to clear Woman goes to Lithuania for op over waiting lists It is up to individual health boards to decide what treatments to postpone based on their specific challenges. Total staff absence within NHS Wales is at 7%, says chief executive Judith Paget ""The work that's being done by the modellers here within Welsh government is looking at various options up to about a 17% staff absence,"" she added. ""You'll appreciate that the NHS has coped with significant waves of Covid-19, and coped very well. It knows how to adapt. ""But yes, it will mean redeployment of staff. And we've already increased the number of staff that we've got going into this winter from the same time last year."" Ms Paget also said health boards were making plans that could see some field hospitals reopen to help speed up the release of recovered patients from hospital wards. The warning comes as the latest NHS performance figures were published. Figures show that NHS waiting lists in Wales havegrown for the 18th successive month. In October there were 679,626 waiting for planned treatments, more than ten thousand more than the month before and the highest number yet. This figure equates to more than 21% of the welsh population and is 50% higher than at the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile performance figures for A&E departments and the ambulance service have shown an improvement in the latest period. The figures show that in November, emergency departments 67.63% of patients spent less than four hours before being admitted, transferred or discharged. In November the ambulance service responded 53.0% of red calls (where a life is at immediate risk) within eight minutes - an improvement on the record low of 50% recorded in October. There are more than 668,000 people in Wales waiting for planned treatment The Welsh government has already invested an extra Â£248m to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times. Health Minister Eluned Morgan previously warned that ""real progress"" was not to be expected before the spring. But since then, services have been further hit by the expansion of the booster programme following a rapid spread of Omicron cases. On Thursday Wales Public Health Wales reported 3,292 new Covid cases and 10 new deaths. ""We have real concerns about the numbers of people we could see going off with Omicron and that will have an impact not just on the NHS, of course, but on the wider society as well,"" said Ms Morgan. One of those concerns, she added, was that ""we may see departments going down and that could really cause a huge amount of complexity and difficulty in particular areas at particular times"". Jane Baker, from Carmarthen, is one of more than 668,000 people in Wales waiting for planned treatment. Jane Baker owns a haberdashery market stall in Carmarthen After an operation on her left hand to ease her carpal tunnel syndrome nearly three years ago, surgery she still needs to remedy the pain and numbness in her right hand has been delayed by Covid. ""But there are times when it's absolute agony and it's a hot water bottle and a bandage to try and keep things warm,"" said the haberdashery market stall holder. ""I use my hands all the time with sewing, it's my livelihood. So at the moment it's a bit difficult when you haven't got any feeling in your fingertips."" Danny van Opstal has been altering his diet to try and find out the cause of his stomach problems Meanwhile, Danny van Opstal, who works nearby to Ms Baker on the cheese and wine stall, is another on a lengthy waiting list. ""I've got quite a bad stomach problem, before the lockdown I had already made an appointment - that's almost two years,"" he said. ""I've had lots of bad nights, it's had a big impact on me. I've left milk out, sugars out, alcohol, to see where the problem is coming from, but it keeps coming back."" Both Ms Baker and Mr van Opstal were recently contacted with the offer of being seen privately - paid for by the NHS - although it's not clear whether the recent pressures brought on my Omicron will affect that.

Global vaccine rollout a stain on our soul - Brown,"In Nigeria only one in 20 people has been jabbed Former prime minister Gordon Brown says the failure to distribute vaccines to poorer countries is a ""stain on our global soul"". He said people were realising coronavirus would ""come back to haunt"" every country, without a push to get the whole world vaccinated next year. So far, eight billion Covid vaccines have been administered worldwide. But of those, the vast majority have been given in high and middle-income countries. Vaccinations: More than 50 nations miss target set by the WHO Omicron variant: Are low vaccination rates in South Africa a factor? Brown: Â£22bn for Covid vaccines 'small price to pay' The World Health Organization (WHO) says 98 countries have not yet met the target of vaccinating 40% of their populations. About three-quarters of the population have received a vaccine in the UK, US and France, and 80% in Japan. In Nigeria only one in 20 people has been jabbed, and in Ethiopia the figure is just 8%. Only one in four African healthcare workers has been vaccinated. Some have linked low vaccination rates to the emergence of new coronavirus variants such as Omicron, first identified in South Africa and now spreading rapidly across the world. In an interview with the BBC World Service, Mr Brown said the uneven distribution of Covid vaccines ""is one of the greatest policy failures of our times"" and had been caused by wealthy countries hoarding and stockpiling vaccines. He predicted another five million people could die from the virus worldwide if better vaccine access was not achieved soon. Mr Brown, who was prime minister from 2007 to 2010, said: ""It's really a stain on our global soul and it affects us all - because I think people are beginning to realise that if we allow the disease to spread in poor countries and the virus mutates, it comes back to haunt even the fully-vaccinated."" He argued it was an achievable task, saying: ""We have the technology. We have the expertise and we're producing 1.5 billion vaccines now a month. We could get them out to people and we will all suffer if we don't do this."" In Nigeria, some vaccine supplies have arrived too close to their use-by date, and have had to be dumped Mr Brown said he hoped world leaders would come together and agree to make the distribution of vaccines a priority at the start of 2022. He also wants more funding for fragile healthcare systems, and better distribution of testing equipment and treatments for Covid-19. Mr Brown said that, as a father of teenage boys, he felt sorry for the young who had had a year or two taken out of their lives. Ensuring fairer access to vaccines, he argued, would be well worth it in economic terms given the trillions of dollars at stake in global trade - as well as improving everyone's mental health. On Wednesday, a top WHO official said she believed the world was still in the ""middle"" of the pandemic. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said: ""Getting vaccines to those who need them most must be a priority for every single government - not just some. ""If we don't, we will continue to see the virus change and threaten us in ways that will bring us closer to the beginning rather than closer to the end.""

Fake parcel delivery texts to spike this Christmas,"The scam messages lead to a convincing website asking for bank details More than a million scam texts will be sent in the UK this week, and more than half will use parcel deliveries to try to trick consumers. Organisations monitoring ""smishing"" fraud are warning people to be extra vigilant this Christmas. One cyber-security firm, Proofpoint, is seeing ten times more scam messages this year than last. Vice president of operations Jacinta Tobin said a mix of Covid and Christmas makes the texts more tempting. ""We are totally susceptible, because we trust and we act quickly,"" she said, with 98% of people reading a text within three minutes. ""And up to only a few years ago texts were used by friends and families."" She said businesses have only recently moved to texts. ""So have scammers and it's very effective for them,"" she added. ""Smishing"" or ""SMS phishing"" is where fraudsters send texts to mobile phones in the hope that people will click on a link and download malicious software or give away private data. Proofpoint works with regulators and retailers, collating and analysing smishing texts. Ms Tobin said fraudsters use fear to manipulate us: ""We don't want to miss that parcel or present. We are seeing more and more urgent messages warning packages will be returned unless action is taken."" It's easy to get depressed when it comes to scams and think we can never be a step ahead of the criminals. Web links are rotated simply and cheaply, and scammers adapt their tactics to the season, looking for easy prey. Although it's never going to be possible to stop scams, it is possible to get quicker at taking them down, and there's more than you might imagine being done to combat these crimes. Mobile operators, the National Cyber Security Centre, banks, and the biggest online retailers and brands, are all working with the police to share information. In fact, cyber-security firm Proofpoint told me that the UK has more industry collaboration than any other country they work in. Each message we report provides a small piece of a jigsaw. It not only keeps other people safe by getting the links taken down, but gradually produces a picture of the criminals pulling the strings behind the scenes. Deliveries are a good lure for now. But after Christmas Proofpoint expects a spike in Boxing Day sales, deals and discounts, and Omicron scam texts. But the text is just the first half of the fraud. Katy Worobec heads up the economic crime unit at UK Finance. Her team have been monitoring impersonation scams, which have more than doubled in 2021. ""This is where scammers use the information that they glean from these interactions, then pretend to be from your bank or police and get people to move significant funds between accounts,"" she said, adding that this money then goes on to be used by large criminal gangs in drugs and human trafficking. In the first half of this year UK Finance's dedicated crime unit made arrests, taking down 24 criminal gangs and preventing Â£85m worth of fraud. But the scams keep evolving, and Katy and her team are expecting this Christmas to be particularly problematic. It's the busiest time of year for deliveries with extra pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. Not only are more people shopping online to avoid crowded stores, but also coronavirus is disrupting delivery services, leading to staff shortages for sickness and isolation. The Royal Mail said staff sickness was currently double what it would be in a typical year and it has severe staff shortages at the moment. Hermes has also reported some delays due to staff illness. DPD and UPS said services are running as normal. Adam Christie, privacy manager at the Royal Mail, said consumers will never receive just a text or email from them asking for money or more information. ""We love putting things through your letterbox. Do not make any payments until you also receive a card through the door,"" he said. This year, the Royal Mail has been contacted by 60,000 members of the public concerned about texts or emails pretending to be them. As a result, 40,000 websites have been taken down or blocked within 24 hour that claim to be for Royal Mail parcel fees. ""The business is doing everything it can to deliver Christmas to people,"" Mr Christie added. ""But we would urge people to be suspicious and not to click on any links they are sent unless they are 100% certain it's from us."" Likewise, a spokesperson for Hermes said: ""We're aware of a phishing attempt claiming to be Hermes where individuals are receiving a text message including a link to pay for parcel delivery. We would never ask for payment in this way."" Royal Mail, UKFinance and Proofpoint are all urging consumers to forward dodgy texts so they can take action. Currently only about a quarter of us do so. Consumers can forward any suspicious message to 7726 or viathe Royal Mail website,external. The regulator Ofcom also hasinformation about scams on its website,external.

In an interview with the BBC World Service, Mr Brown said the uneven distribution of Covid vaccines ""is one of the greatest policy failures of our times"" and had been caused by wealthy countries hoarding and stockpiling vaccines. He predicted another five million people could die from the virus worldwide if better vaccine access was not achieved soon. Mr Brown, who was prime minister from 2007 to 2010, said: ""It's really a stain on our global soul and it affects us all - because I think people are beginning to realise that if we allow the disease to spread in poor countries and the virus mutates, it comes back to haunt even the fully-vaccinated."" He argued it was an achievable task, saying: ""We have the technology. We have the expertise and we're producing 1.5 billion vaccines now a month. We could get them out to people and we will all suffer if we don't do this."" In Nigeria, some vaccine supplies have arrived too close to their use-by date, and have had to be dumped Mr Brown said he hoped world leaders would come together and agree to make the distribution of vaccines a priority at the start of 2022. He also wants more funding for fragile healthcare systems, and better distribution of testing equipment and treatments for Covid-19. Mr Brown said that, as a father of teenage boys, he felt sorry for the young who had had a year or two taken out of their lives. Ensuring fairer access to vaccines, he argued, would be well worth it in economic terms given the trillions of dollars at stake in global trade - as well as improving everyone's mental health. On Wednesday, a top WHO official said she believed the world was still in the ""middle"" of the pandemic. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said: ""Getting vaccines to those who need them most must be a priority for every single government - not just some. ""If we don't, we will continue to see the virus change and threaten us in ways that will bring us closer to the beginning rather than closer to the end.""

Vaccine rollout 'a stain on our soul' - Gordon Brown,"In Nigeria only one in 20 people has been jabbed Former prime minister Gordon Brown says the failure to distribute vaccines to poorer countries is a ""stain on our global soul"". He said people were realising coronavirus would ""come back to haunt"" every country, without a push to get the whole world vaccinated next year. So far, eight billion Covid vaccines have been administered worldwide. But of those, the vast majority have been given in high and middle-income countries. Vaccinations: More than 50 nations miss target set by the WHO Omicron variant: Are low vaccination rates in South Africa a factor? Brown: Â£22bn for Covid vaccines 'small price to pay' The World Health Organization (WHO) says 98 countries have not yet met the target of vaccinating 40% of their populations. About three-quarters of the population have received a vaccine in the UK, US and France, and 80% in Japan. In Nigeria only one in 20 people has been jabbed, and in Ethiopia the figure is just 8%. Only one in four African healthcare workers has been vaccinated. Some have linked low vaccination rates to the emergence of new coronavirus variants such as Omicron, first identified in South Africa and now spreading rapidly across the world. In an interview with the BBC World Service, Mr Brown said the uneven distribution of Covid vaccines ""is one of the greatest policy failures of our times"" and had been caused by wealthy countries hoarding and stockpiling vaccines.
