Spain's King Felipe renounces father's inheritance,"King Felipe VI (right) is trying to distance himself from his father Juan Carlos, Spanish royal analysts say Spain's King Felipe VI has renounced the inheritance of his scandal-hit father Juan Carlos. In a statement, the palace said that Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014, would also stop receiving an annual grant of â¬194,000 (Â£174,800; $217,100). This comes as the 82-year-old former king is being criticised for his lavish lifestyle. Juan Carlos, who reigned for 39 years, is also facing an investigation by the Swiss financial authorities. This follows media reports that he had received $100m in 2008 from Saudi Arabia via an offshore account. The former monarch has made no comments on the issue. This video can not be played King Juan Carlos abdicated in June 2014, saying his son Prince Felipe would ""open a new era of hope"" for Spain Some royal analysts in Spain say that by renouncing his father's inheritance, King Felipe VI, 52, is trying to distance himself from his father's affairs. Juan Carlos ascended the throne in 1975 on the death of General Francisco Franco, the right-wing dictator who ruled Spain for 36 years after his victory over Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. Juan Carlos (l) became king two days after the death of General Franco (r) Juan Carlos became Spain's first crowned head of state for 44 years. But he soon ignored Franco's supporters, who wanted an extension to autocratic rule, and ushered in a new system of parliamentary monarchy. As the years went on the king involved himself less in day-to-day politics, and became more of a figurehead. He is credited as a stabilising force for independence-minded areas such as Catalonia and the Basque region, and he also helped defuse an attempted coup in 1981. King Juan Carlos of Spain abdicates Profile: Spain's Juan Carlos King Felipe VI says Catalonia 'will remain' Spanish Until a few years before his abdication his popularity was high, but a lavish elephant hunting trip to Botswana in 2012 and corruption allegations involving his youngest daughter, Cristina, and her husband IÃ±aki Urdangarin, led to calls for him to step aside.

EU states record highest one-day death toll,"This video can not be played Police use drones to enforce movement restrictions in Spain's fight against the coronavirus infection The three states bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe have all recorded their highest death tolls for a single day. Italy saw 368 deaths bring its total to 1,809, Spain recorded 97 more deaths for a total of 288, and France reported 29 deaths, giving a total of 120. The UK also saw a single-day record, with 14 new deaths and a total of 35. Governments across Europe have responded by curbing the movements of citizens and tightening borders. Germany is to impose controls on its borderswith France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg as of Monday morning, while Portugal will clamp down on its frontier with Spain. The Czech government has introduced stringent lockdown measures: people will be allowed to go to and from work and buy food or medicine, and make urgent family visits, but otherwise free movement will be severely limited from midnight (23:00 GMT) on Sunday until 24 March. Austria is banning gatherings of more than five people from Monday, and the Republic of Ireland is asking pubs to shut until 29 March. Schools will be closed across many European states. The World Health Organization (WHO) has now declaredEurope the ""epicentre"" of the pandemicwhich originated in China.

In an indication of the extent of the crisis, Switzerland reported a leap in the number of infections by 800 to reach 2,200 in just 24 hours. The country has recorded 14 deaths. Italy has borne the heaviest burden from the pandemic with 24,747 infections and 1,218 of its fatalities were recorded in one region, Lombardy, which is home to the business hub of Milan. The government put the whole country in lockdown last Monday, restricting people's movements and ordering the closure of all shops except food stores and pharmacies. Schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues had been closed earlier. On Saturday, Spain, which now has 7,753 infections, and France, which has 5,400, took drastic temporary measures of their own. The Spanish government banned people from leaving home except for buying essential supplies and medicines, or for work. The area near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was quiet on Sunday In France, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and most shops are now shut. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called on member states to fight the pandemic with a rapidly co-ordinated response and pooled resources. She said the bloc would boost production of equipment such as ventilators, test kits and masks, which would then be shared across the EU instead of each country making its own supply. The export of these products to non-EU countries would be strictly controlled. To date,an estimated 162,687 people have been infected worldwide,external, with just under half of them in China (81,003 cases). An estimated 6,065 people have died, 3,085 of them in China. South Africa is closing its borders from Wednesday to foreign nationals from countries badly impacted by coronavirus. With 61 infections, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the country was now dealing with the internal transmission of the virus and declared a ""national state of disaster"".

"Help make more ventilators, minister tells industry","Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to speak to engineering firms on Monday about whether they can shift production lines to building NHS ventilators. It comes amid growing concern about a shortage of the life-saving equipment as coronavirus infections increase. Carmakers and the construction equipment firm JCB are among manufacturers to be contacted. Downing Street said it wanted the manufacturing sector ""to come together to help the country"". ""Preparing for the spread of the coronavirus outbreak is a national priority and we're calling on the manufacturing industry and all those with relevant expertise who might be able to help to come together to help the country tackle this national crisis,"" Downing Street said. ""We need to step up production of vital equipment such as ventilators so that we can all help the most vulnerable, and we need businesses to come to us and help in this national effort."" However, BBC business editor Simon Jack said that manufacturers were far from ready to switch production. One company told him that comparisons with the accelerated production of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced as there was no accepted design nor guarantee components could be sourced quickly. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort"" It is understood one subject on the agenda during the prime minister's talks with industry on Monday is whether specialist firms that make ventilators and other critical equipment might be prepared to share their intellectual property. Engineers have already been asked to draw up plans to quickly produce more ventilators. And on Sunday evening, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat tweeted: ""The Prime Minister is calling for a National Effort for Ventilator production. We have been inundated with offers. ""If you produce ventilators please call the BEIS Business Support helpline on 0300 456 3565. A specific team receiving these calls will start at 10am tomorrow."" On Sunday's BBC Andrew Marr show, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said engineering firms should consider switching some manufacturing to help ramp production of the vital equipment. He accepted it was the kind of policy normally reserved for times of war. ""We've got high quality engineering in this country,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators, to do that."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic LATEST UPDATES:Follow live Ventilators are vital in the treatment of patients whose lungs have been attacked by the infection. The health secretary told Sky News that the country currently has 5,000 ventilators but said it would need ""many times more than that"". But questions remain over how engineering firms with no experience of producing ventilators will be able start manufacturing the complex medical devices. In a statement on Sunday, the chairman JCB, Lord Bamford, said: ""We have been approached by the prime minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. ""We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment,"" he said. However, he continued: ""It's unclear as yet if we can assist, but as a British company, we will do whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing."" A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy) Manufacturing firm, Unipart, confirmed that it was involved in the discussions and aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce said it was ""keen to do whatever we can"". It is not just manufacturing firms that have offered their services. Hotel chain Best Western has said it could turn its properties into temporary hospitals if the NHS needed additional bed space during the coronavirus outbreak. The company said it had seen a surge in cancellations over the last month due to the outbreak. ""If the NHS wants additional bed space, and we can partner with other companies to provide the right medical equipment and supplies, and we can do it safely, then we would be willing to start having those conversations immediately,"" the hotel chain's boss, Rob Paterson, said. Manufacturers asked by the government to produce thousands of ventilators to help save the lives of seriously affected victims of coronavirus are not ready to fill the demand. Although firms including JCB, Unipart, Rolls-Royce and others are in close conversation with the government, no detailed blueprint for increased manufacture of the life-saving equipment currently exists. One manufacturer told the BBC that comparisons with the accelerated manufacture of Spitfire aircraft during World War Two were misplaced, as there was no accepted design. Even if there was, there is no guarantee the components could be sourced in time to even start production in the next two months. Ventilators are vital as medical experts estimate that between 10% and 20% of those who succumb to the virus will need critical care. Many of those will need help breathing. Although firms stand ready and able to produce more ventilators, a lack of clarity on design specifications and component sourcing mean that production remains many weeks away.

Virus isolation for over-70s 'within weeks',"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort"" Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to protect themselves from coronavirus. When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. The government is to release social distancing advice for elderly people on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods. Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35. Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS. He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals. The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to thelatest Department of Health figures,external. Almost all of the new cases were in England, but34 new cases were announced in Wales,32 in Scotlandand11 in Northern Ireland. Most of the 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK have so far been people aged over 60 and with underlying health conditions. People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are no longer being tested.The government says,externaltests will primarily be given: To all patients needing hospital treatment for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons This video can not be played Watch: How to self-isolate Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would soon be asked to self-isolate - but he did not say for how long. He toldthe BBC's Andrew Marr Showpeople without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends as long as they stayed 2m (6ft) away from them. Five ways hospitals will change to tackle virus 'I've cancelled my wedding because of coronavirus' Some scientists say UK virus strategy 'risks lives' The health secretary also said the NHS would stop non-urgent surgery and retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those with the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. He said details of emergency legislation giving the government more powers to deal with the outbreak will be shared on Tuesday. This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticises the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic The health minister for Wales, Vaughan Gething, said it was ""entirely possible"" elderly people would be asked to self-isolate for long periods. ""That shouldn't be a surprise,"" he added. But the Scottish government said it had no plans to isolate the elderly, and would instead""ask them to reduce social contact"". Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them."" Scottish ministers have also advised against gatherings of 500 people or more. They do not have the power to call off events but have urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" by cancelling such gatherings from Monday. Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend"" The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said. Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol, who died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday. His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic She urged people not to visit her and her family until their own test results for the virus came back. Mr and Mrs Matthews had returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, on 29 February. Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment -  but that many times that number would be needed. Car companies and weapon manufacturers are among the firmsthe government has asked to help to make ventilatorsto treat Covid-19 patients. Ventilators treat severe breathing problems caused by Covid-19 by giving people oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from their lungs. Digger manufacturer JCB said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if it could help. JCB chairman Lord Bamford said it was ""unclear"" whether the firm could agree to do so, but that engineers were ""actively looking"" at the request. Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday. Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks. So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home. They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third. But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically. They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks. That's why it's essential people don't start too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self-isolating. But officials recognise individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

Here are some of the biggest developments:  At a press conference, US Vice President Mike Pence said testing for coronavirus was expanding, with more than 2,000 labs around the country now ready to process tests. Drive-through tests will also be available in 10 states. He added that the government would be issuing updated guidelines on Monday to help prevent the spread. At a press conference, US President Donald Trump said he was ""very happy"" with the Federal Reserve's emergency measures. Earlier today,the central bank said it would slash interest rates and launch a $700bn stimulus programmeto protect the economy from the impact of coronavirus. President Trump said the country was doing well in its battle against the pandemic, and pleaded with people not to panic buy. He added that grocery shops would work round the clock to keep their stores stocked, insisting there was no need for people to hoard food. California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued sweeping new restrictions for the US state. He's issued a compulsory isolation order for all residents aged 65 and above, and said the state is launching an effort to get get all homeless people indoors, in trailers and motels. The governor has also asked for bars, breweries and pubs to close their doors. He stopped short of closing restaurants, but said they need to halve their occupancy and operate home deliveries and collections. Governors in Ohio and Illinois issued similar orders on Sunday in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. On Friday, Canadian public safety minister Bill Blair announced ""enhanced screening measures"" at all international airports, as well as at rail, land and marine ports of entry. The government has said some measures are already in place, like additional screening questions at international kiosks. But some argue that airports are still not doing enough. One travellernoted on Twitter,externalthat they had waited in line at Toronto's Pearson International Airport for over an hour, packed in with hundreds of people and with no access to masks or sanitiser - and there was ""zero screening"". Another,externaltweeted at the airport's official account, saying she had arrived back in Canada from abroad and was not asked any questions about her health or told to consider self-isolating. There appear to be similar issues at Vancouver International Airport. There are currently more than 250 confirmed cases in Canada. In another move to steady the global economy, the US Federal Reserve said it has signed an agreement with the central banks of Canada, Japan, Switzerland, the UK and the European Central Bank. Under the deal, the banks have agreed to lower the price of standing US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 25 basis points. This means the new rate will be equivalent to the US dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 25 basis points. A currency swap line is an agreement allowing two central banks to exchange their native currencies. They are typically used to fund market interventions, preserve financial stability and protect national economies from the impact of market tensions. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said the new agreement ""will help economies to bridge the disruption from an economic shock that could
prove sharp and large, but should be temporary."" The US Federal Reserve has made its second emergency cut to interest rates in less than two weeks. In a statement, the central bank said it would lower the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 0-0.25%. It has pledged to keep it at this level ""until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events."" Israel's government has approved the use of anti-terrorism tracking technology in the fight against coronavirus. Under the measure, Israel's security service Shin Bet will be able to track the movements of those whose have tested positive for virus, and discover the identities of anyone who may have come into contact with them. The monitoring will include phone data. In a tweet, Transport Minister Betzalel Smotrich insisted the move wouldn't lead to ""a Big Brother state"". Plans to introduce wide-scale cyber-tracking were criticised earlier this week by Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the left-wing Meretz party. Mr Horowitz said the ""intrusive measures"" would be ""a harsh blow to privacy and basic liberty"". The New York Yankees have ordered all players from their minor league affiliates to be quarantined for two weeks after one tested positive for coronavirus. They've not divulged the player's identity, but said he had no known link to any Major League players. It marks the first known case of the virus in America's professional baseball community. Like other teams in US Major League Baseball, the Yankees are partnered with minor league affiliates who provide experience and training for younger players. Successful players can also move up from affiliates to major league partners. Ohio has become the first US state to order to the closure of all bars and restaurants, except for home deliveries and collections. In a tweet, state Governor Mike DeWine said the order would come into effect from 2100 local time (0100 GMT). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington DC Inside the White House presidential aides are getting ready for âa News Conference by the CoronaVirus
Task Forceâ, as Trump put it in a tweet, at 17:00EST (21:00 GMT). Meanwhile, airports across
the US have become chaotic temperature-checking zones as hordes of travellers
return from Europe and the UK, downtown Washington looks like a ghost town (no
taxis in sight and, starting tomorrow, buses running on a limited schedule), and the Governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, said on Twitter last night
that  âthe federal government needs to get its s@#t togetherâ.  (As a
postscript, he added: âNOW.â) At the briefing today, journalists will ask the
White House officials what additional measures â if any â they will be taking
to restrict travel. My colleagues here in the West Wing also have a special interest
in finding out whether one of the briefers, the vice-president, who has met
with an official whoâs infected with coronavirus, has himself been tested. As
the president would say: stay tuned. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg On a continent which the virus has been slow to penetrate â
a sudden sense of urgency. Looking grave, South Africaâs President Cyril Ramaphosa
warned of severe economic damage, but said there could be no half-measures. Foreign visitors from Britain, Italy the US and other
high-risk countries will now be barred. Most land crossings into South Africa
will also be shut. Gatherings of more than 100 people are no longer allowed.
All schools will be closed. Kenya has announced similar measures. So far Africa as a whole has only confirmed about 300 cases,
and six deaths â with Egypt, Algeria, Senegal and South Africa accounting for
most of those. But there are concerns that the Coronavirus could quickly
overwhelm many African health systems, and spread quickly in crowded
neighbourhoods and among poorer communities, where peopleâs immune systems may
already be weakened by malnutrition or disease. It is clear, said President Ramaphosa, that no country will
be spared. But he said the greatest danger was fear and ignorance. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent From midnight on Sunday, the Czech Republic will effectively seal its borders in an effort contain the spread of the coronavirus. Czechs
are being encouraged to return home immediately. Those who find themselves
stranded outside the countryâs borders after midnight will
still be allowed to return home, although those arriving from 15 âhigh-riskâ
countries will have to undergo quarantine.
But once home they - along with virtually every Czech citizen - will not be
allowed to leave the country for the duration of the 30-day state of emergency. It's the most draconian restrictions introduced by a Czech government in the country's 27 years as an independent state. Jan Hamacek, Czech Minister of the Interior, told the BBC it is ""the only effective way"" to combat the outbreak. Most Czechs appear broadly sympathetic to the measures for perilous days, although there are voices of dissent. Petr Kutilek, a local politician for the Green Party, said he believed the government had not given a proper explanation of why such extreme limits were being imposed. âThey also raise doubts that [the government] is in fact covering up for
failures in providing health care professionals and other frontline responders
with respirators and other vital equipment,â he added. For most Czechs, free movement is one of the hallowed four freedoms of EU
membership. People seem ready to relinquish that right. At least for 30 days. The Italian flag and a message of support have been projected onto the walls of Jerusalem""s Old City in a show of show of solidarity with Italy, where the virus has claimed more than 1,800 lives. France has joined Italy and Spain in recording a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases. Health Minister Oliver Veran told news outlet France 2 that around 5,400 cases have been reported around the country, nearly 1,000 more than Saturday.

Voters earlier this month in Washington State On Tuesday, four more US states will hold primary contests where Democratic voters will select either Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders as their pick to run against Donald Trump in the November general election. Some states have already postponed their election, or are planning to, because of coronavirus concerns. Polling stations nationwide are considering ways to protect voters, such as hand-sanitising stations. The US voter groups with the highest historic turnout rate are Americans over the age of 45.Pew Research Center,externalreports that in 2020, nearly a quarter of the electorate will be above 65. Sunday saw Mr Biden encourage healthy individuals to participate in the ""most sacred American right"" of voting, which drew some Twitter criticism.

Iraqi officials have imposed a curfew in the nation's capital, Baghdad, as they attempt to control the spread of coronavirus. There are currently 110 confirmed cases of the virus in Iraq. The state news agency announced that the curfew would be in effect from 17 to 24 March, Reuters news agency reports. Iraqi officials had earlier banned domestic travel from today until 25 March, except for emergencies, trade and those commuting for work. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News Here in India theyâve effectively closed the borders. Most foreigners are not allowed to enter the country until 15 April as a coronavirus precaution. I made it back just before the restrictions came in, and had to go through mandatory medical checks before I was allowed through immigration. First I had to fill out a form asking for a range of information, including my seat number on the plane and my travel history going back a month. Next, a heat-sensing camera took a photograph of me to check my temperature was normal, before I was waved through. The process was extremely efficient, compared with the long lines seen at US airports. So far, the number of reported coronavirus cases in India is relatively low given the countryâs population is about 1.3 billion. But there are concerns not enough people are being tested and that the true extent of coronavirus here is unknown. New arrivals were being photographed with a heat-sensing camera A friend in Delhi who said he had a high fever and breathing difficulties was unable to reach the government helpline, despite calling more than 30 times. When he finally talked to someone in the Health Ministry (via a personal contact, not the helpline) he was told he wasnât eligible for testing, so he decided to self-isolate. But if people like him who might be carrying the virus arenât getting tested and are moving freely, the situation could become incredibly grave. The government says it has drawn up a multi-pronged strategy to contain the spread of Covid-19. Given this is the worldâs second largest population, with poor public health access in many communities, the next steps it takes will be crucial. Screenings will be strengthened at South African airports South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the nation's borders will be closed to all foreign nationals from ""high-risk"" countries: Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK and China. He said the travel ban would come in effect on 18 March. ""Any person who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,"" the president said. ""South African citizens returning from high-risk countries will be subjected to testing and self-isolation or quarantine on return to South Africa."" He also said additional screenings would begin at airports, government travel would be limited, and gatherings of more than 100 people were now prohibited. Schools will also close from 18 March until after the Easter weekend. South Africa has the second-highest number of cases on the continent - 61, according to AFP news agency. Most infected individuals had recently travelled to Europe. During a briefing on Saturday, the White House suggested domestic travel restrictions could be next. But the US infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Faucitold ABC News,externalon Sunday the move has ""not been seriously discussed"". ""I don't see that right now in the immediate future,"" Dr Fauci said. ""But remember, we are very open minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public."" There are currently over 2,900 confirmed cases in the US, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. There have been 57 deaths so far. Dr Fauci said he was confident that currently, the government was doing everything it can to control the outbreak. ""You've got to be almost overreacting a bit to keep up with it,"" he said, adding that people ""need to understand that things will get worse before they get better"".

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35. Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS. He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals.

Supermarkets urge shoppers to stop stockpiling,"Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling. In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items. ""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds. It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely. In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"". The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked. Can you stop people stockpiling? Food bank shortage blamed on coronavirus panic Stockpiling 'will hit vulnerable', food bank warns ""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads. That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked."" In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply. That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item. Tesco,shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods,including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables. There were empty shelves at a Waitrose in Sheffield Meanwhile, Waitrose has brought in a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes. Boots and Asda are both restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person. Campaigners have warned stockpiling couldhit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest. By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them. It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile. The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand. But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need. Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic itemswhich have already been panic bought by shoppers. The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"". The government isrelaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailersto try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items. Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents. Shoppers faced a long queue at the tills in Morrisons in Kettering on Sunday Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves. Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

Parents are desperately looking for childcare following Friday's announcement that schools will close from Monday. Thousands of families who booked Easter holidays abroad must cancel: there are few countries the Swiss can travel to at the moment. But on this sunny weekend, people are out and about. Restaurants are limited to 50 people but business is quite brisk. Tables are 2m (6ft) apart and disinfected regularly. One elderly lady, carefully washing her hands after enjoying a hot chocolate, says she knows it's important to follow the rules. But, she adds, ""I won't stop social contact."" And yet that is exactly what the government wants her to do. Meanwhile a waitress whispers that she doesn't think the restaurant will stay open much longer. She's worried for her job. In canton Ticino, and in Basel, the restaurants are already closed. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz urged people to self-isolate and banned gatherings of more than five people as of Monday.

US cuts rates and launches huge stimulus programme,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held a media conference on Sunday The US has cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn stimulus programme in a bid to protect the economy from the effect of coronavirus. It is part of a co-ordinated action announced on Sunday in the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland. In a news conference Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the pandemic was having a ""profound"" impact on the economy. US President Donald Trump said the emergency action ""makes me very happy"". The Fed has cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and said it would it begin buying bonds - quantitative easing - a move that pumps money directly into the economy. The central bank had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point after an emergency meeting on 3 March. That had been the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008. Stock markets have plunged in recent days amid fears that economic paralysis will wipe out corporate profits and spark a global recession. But early indications suggest the Fed's move may not shore up financial markets. US stock market futures, which anticipate the direction of shares when trading begins, were almost 4% down. LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Speaking after the emergency meeting, which was held in place of the Fed's regular rates setting decision scheduled for this week, Mr Powell warned that although it was clear the outbreak was already having a major impact on the economy it was still too early to tell just how far-reaching the effects will be. ""The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus... that is not something that is knowable,"" he said. As part of Sunday's announcement, the Fed will work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks. These so-called currency swap lines,externalwere an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeds him as BoE chief on Monday. The Bank of Japan also eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has now fired most of its remaining big guns to stimulate a US economy facing a serious financial shock from the coronavirus. Interest rates were slashed by one full percentage point to just above zero, and the bank restarted the pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets. Global central banks, including the Bank of England, joined in to ease the flow of dollars around the world. It was the full crisis toolkit designed to inject confidence into markets that ran riot last week as the outbreak turned into a global pandemic. While the moves should soothe the financing of US business, they also reflect that the health emergency in the US has become far worse than expected and reveals US authorities are running short of options. Interest rate cuts are a blunt instrument to deal with a pandemic, and more is expected from Congress and the White House, in particular. President Trump welcomed the cut, but it was his decision to ban European travel that sparked the latest record share sell off on Thursday. There is some hope that a video conference call later between leaders of the G7 western industrialised nations, including President Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will result in a more coordinated global approach to the virus. The authorities will be watching markets carefully today, including Mr Bailey, on his first day in the job. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at UK-based CMC Markets, described the co-ordinated move as throwing ""the kitchen sink at the markets. [It] serves to underscore the seriousness of the economic shocks coming our way"". And in the US, Greg McBridge, chief financial analyst at online bank and mortgage firm Bankrate.com, said: ""Desperate times call for desperate measures and the Fed is doing just that in an effort to keep credit markets functioning and prevent the type of starving of credit that nearly toppled the global economy into a depression in 2008. ""Reducing interest rates to borrowers will ease the burden of existing debts slightly but is unlikely to spur the usual surge of borrowing as consumers and businesses batten down the hatches for a coming drop off in US economic activity.""

Disarray hits US airports over virus screenings,"Passengers arriving at Chicago O'Hare airport faced lengthy waits US airports have been thrown into chaos as new coronavirus health screening measures for people returning from Europe come into force. Long queues formed as travellers waited for hours for the screenings before passing through customs. The US is banning the entry of people travelling from the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (04:00 GMT Tuesday). As a result, the UK Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential travel to the whole of the US. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that the US is ""doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports"". ""Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!"" The US has more than 2,700 confirmed cases, with 54 deaths. Correspondents say there is a growing sense of unease and confusion in the US, with fears of a run on hospital beds and concern about childcare as tens of millions of children are sent home from school.

The US administration has imposed a ban on non-Americans travelling from the 26 European countries in the Schengen free movement zone. The ban will be extended to the UK and Ireland as of Tuesday. US citizens are allowed to return but face screening. Passengers arriving at O'Hare on Saturday had to wait for several hours to clear screening Ruth Procopi, who has lived in the Chicago area for 20 years, returned on Saturday from the UK, where she had been visiting family. ""I arrived at [O'Hare airport] from Heathrow at about 3:30pm yesterday. It was chaos. Nobody explained anything,"" she told the BBC. ""And I was one of the lucky ones - I had no checked bags to try to find and because I had not been to a Schengen country, I did not have to undergo additional screening (still not sure what that was), but I didn't find out until I got to the front of this line. ""We were told there was additional screening while on the plane, but no details. We were not told anything at any stage. It took me two hours to get through."" Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said the long lines at O'Hare were ""unacceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Passengers are being questioned about their medical histories and checked for symptoms. Another O'Hare traveller, Tim Clancy, told the BBC the airport was ""really hectic"". ""I felt there wasn't a lot of access to hand sanitiser or restrooms because you'd likely lose your place in the queue. I didn't see too many people coughing though."" Mr Clancy, 20, was returning home after studying in Athens, Greece. He ended up queuing for a total of five hours. A nurse took his temperature before he was allowed to leave the airport.

Paige Hardy, a US graduate student returning from London, told the New York Times there was alarm on her flight to Dallas,externalafter a series of confusing announcements. ""It truly felt like an apocalyptic scenario,"" she said. Passengers were packed into dense lines to undergo screening In New York, there were reports of a flight from Paris being boarded by customs agents wearing masks. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said his office was working with airlines to improve screening times. Some public health experts have noted that waiting in crowded terminals could potentially lead to more people becoming infected with the virus.

You can also scroll through this live page to see events as they happened today. Here are some of the biggest developments:  At a press conference, US Vice President Mike Pence said testing for coronavirus was expanding, with more than 2,000 labs around the country now ready to process tests. Drive-through tests will also be available in 10 states. He added that the government would be issuing updated guidelines on Monday to help prevent the spread. At a press conference, US President Donald Trump said he was ""very happy"" with the Federal Reserve's emergency measures. Earlier today,the central bank said it would slash interest rates and launch a $700bn stimulus programmeto protect the economy from the impact of coronavirus. President Trump said the country was doing well in its battle against the pandemic, and pleaded with people not to panic buy. He added that grocery shops would work round the clock to keep their stores stocked, insisting there was no need for people to hoard food. California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued sweeping new restrictions for the US state. He's issued a compulsory isolation order for all residents aged 65 and above, and said the state is launching an effort to get get all homeless people indoors, in trailers and motels. The governor has also asked for bars, breweries and pubs to close their doors. He stopped short of closing restaurants, but said they need to halve their occupancy and operate home deliveries and collections. Governors in Ohio and Illinois issued similar orders on Sunday in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. On Friday, Canadian public safety minister Bill Blair announced ""enhanced screening measures"" at all international airports, as well as at rail, land and marine ports of entry. The government has said some measures are already in place, like additional screening questions at international kiosks. But some argue that airports are still not doing enough. One travellernoted on Twitter,externalthat they had waited in line at Toronto's Pearson International Airport for over an hour, packed in with hundreds of people and with no access to masks or sanitiser - and there was ""zero screening"". Another,externaltweeted at the airport's official account, saying she had arrived back in Canada from abroad and was not asked any questions about her health or told to consider self-isolating. There appear to be similar issues at Vancouver International Airport. There are currently more than 250 confirmed cases in Canada. In another move to steady the global economy, the US Federal Reserve said it has signed an agreement with the central banks of Canada, Japan, Switzerland, the UK and the European Central Bank. Under the deal, the banks have agreed to lower the price of standing US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 25 basis points. This means the new rate will be equivalent to the US dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 25 basis points. A currency swap line is an agreement allowing two central banks to exchange their native currencies. They are typically used to fund market interventions, preserve financial stability and protect national economies from the impact of market tensions. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said the new agreement ""will help economies to bridge the disruption from an economic shock that could
prove sharp and large, but should be temporary."" The US Federal Reserve has made its second emergency cut to interest rates in less than two weeks. In a statement, the central bank said it would lower the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 0-0.25%. It has pledged to keep it at this level ""until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events."" Israel's government has approved the use of anti-terrorism tracking technology in the fight against coronavirus. Under the measure, Israel's security service Shin Bet will be able to track the movements of those whose have tested positive for virus, and discover the identities of anyone who may have come into contact with them. The monitoring will include phone data. In a tweet, Transport Minister Betzalel Smotrich insisted the move wouldn't lead to ""a Big Brother state"". Plans to introduce wide-scale cyber-tracking were criticised earlier this week by Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the left-wing Meretz party. Mr Horowitz said the ""intrusive measures"" would be ""a harsh blow to privacy and basic liberty"". The New York Yankees have ordered all players from their minor league affiliates to be quarantined for two weeks after one tested positive for coronavirus. They've not divulged the player's identity, but said he had no known link to any Major League players. It marks the first known case of the virus in America's professional baseball community. Like other teams in US Major League Baseball, the Yankees are partnered with minor league affiliates who provide experience and training for younger players. Successful players can also move up from affiliates to major league partners. Ohio has become the first US state to order to the closure of all bars and restaurants, except for home deliveries and collections. In a tweet, state Governor Mike DeWine said the order would come into effect from 2100 local time (0100 GMT). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington DC Inside the White House presidential aides are getting ready for âa News Conference by the CoronaVirus
Task Forceâ, as Trump put it in a tweet, at 17:00EST (21:00 GMT). Meanwhile, airports across
the US have become chaotic temperature-checking zones as hordes of travellers
return from Europe and the UK, downtown Washington looks like a ghost town (no
taxis in sight and, starting tomorrow, buses running on a limited schedule), and the Governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, said on Twitter last night
that  âthe federal government needs to get its s@#t togetherâ.  (As a
postscript, he added: âNOW.â) At the briefing today, journalists will ask the
White House officials what additional measures â if any â they will be taking
to restrict travel. My colleagues here in the West Wing also have a special interest
in finding out whether one of the briefers, the vice-president, who has met
with an official whoâs infected with coronavirus, has himself been tested. As
the president would say: stay tuned. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg On a continent which the virus has been slow to penetrate â
a sudden sense of urgency. Looking grave, South Africaâs President Cyril Ramaphosa
warned of severe economic damage, but said there could be no half-measures. Foreign visitors from Britain, Italy the US and other
high-risk countries will now be barred. Most land crossings into South Africa
will also be shut. Gatherings of more than 100 people are no longer allowed.
All schools will be closed. Kenya has announced similar measures. So far Africa as a whole has only confirmed about 300 cases,
and six deaths â with Egypt, Algeria, Senegal and South Africa accounting for
most of those. But there are concerns that the Coronavirus could quickly
overwhelm many African health systems, and spread quickly in crowded
neighbourhoods and among poorer communities, where peopleâs immune systems may
already be weakened by malnutrition or disease. It is clear, said President Ramaphosa, that no country will
be spared. But he said the greatest danger was fear and ignorance. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent From midnight on Sunday, the Czech Republic will effectively seal its borders in an effort contain the spread of the coronavirus. Czechs
are being encouraged to return home immediately. Those who find themselves
stranded outside the countryâs borders after midnight will
still be allowed to return home, although those arriving from 15 âhigh-riskâ
countries will have to undergo quarantine.
But once home they - along with virtually every Czech citizen - will not be
allowed to leave the country for the duration of the 30-day state of emergency. It's the most draconian restrictions introduced by a Czech government in the country's 27 years as an independent state. Jan Hamacek, Czech Minister of the Interior, told the BBC it is ""the only effective way"" to combat the outbreak. Most Czechs appear broadly sympathetic to the measures for perilous days, although there are voices of dissent. Petr Kutilek, a local politician for the Green Party, said he believed the government had not given a proper explanation of why such extreme limits were being imposed. âThey also raise doubts that [the government] is in fact covering up for
failures in providing health care professionals and other frontline responders
with respirators and other vital equipment,â he added. For most Czechs, free movement is one of the hallowed four freedoms of EU
membership. People seem ready to relinquish that right. At least for 30 days. The Italian flag and a message of support have been projected onto the walls of Jerusalem""s Old City in a show of show of solidarity with Italy, where the virus has claimed more than 1,800 lives. France has joined Italy and Spain in recording a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases. Health Minister Oliver Veran told news outlet France 2 that around 5,400 cases have been reported around the country, nearly 1,000 more than Saturday. The number of virus-related deaths has also risen from 91 to 120 during the last 24 hours. Voters earlier this month in Washington State On Tuesday, four more US states will hold primary contests where Democratic voters will select either Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders as their pick to run against Donald Trump in the November general election. Some states have already postponed their election, or are planning to, because of coronavirus concerns. Polling stations nationwide are considering ways to protect voters, such as hand-sanitising stations. The US voter groups with the highest historic turnout rate are Americans over the age of 45.Pew Research Center,externalreports that in 2020, nearly a quarter of the electorate will be above 65.

Iraqi officials have imposed a curfew in the nation's capital, Baghdad, as they attempt to control the spread of coronavirus. There are currently 110 confirmed cases of the virus in Iraq. The state news agency announced that the curfew would be in effect from 17 to 24 March, Reuters news agency reports. Iraqi officials had earlier banned domestic travel from today until 25 March, except for emergencies, trade and those commuting for work. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News Here in India theyâve effectively closed the borders. Most foreigners are not allowed to enter the country until 15 April as a coronavirus precaution. I made it back just before the restrictions came in, and had to go through mandatory medical checks before I was allowed through immigration. First I had to fill out a form asking for a range of information, including my seat number on the plane and my travel history going back a month. Next, a heat-sensing camera took a photograph of me to check my temperature was normal, before I was waved through. The process was extremely efficient, compared with the long lines seen at US airports. So far, the number of reported coronavirus cases in India is relatively low given the countryâs population is about 1.3 billion. But there are concerns not enough people are being tested and that the true extent of coronavirus here is unknown. New arrivals were being photographed with a heat-sensing camera A friend in Delhi who said he had a high fever and breathing difficulties was unable to reach the government helpline, despite calling more than 30 times. When he finally talked to someone in the Health Ministry (via a personal contact, not the helpline) he was told he wasnât eligible for testing, so he decided to self-isolate. But if people like him who might be carrying the virus arenât getting tested and are moving freely, the situation could become incredibly grave. The government says it has drawn up a multi-pronged strategy to contain the spread of Covid-19. Given this is the worldâs second largest population, with poor public health access in many communities, the next steps it takes will be crucial. Screenings will be strengthened at South African airports South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the nation's borders will be closed to all foreign nationals from ""high-risk"" countries: Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK and China. He said the travel ban would come in effect on 18 March. ""Any person who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,"" the president said. ""South African citizens returning from high-risk countries will be subjected to testing and self-isolation or quarantine on return to South Africa."" He also said additional screenings would begin at airports, government travel would be limited, and gatherings of more than 100 people were now prohibited. Schools will also close from 18 March until after the Easter weekend. South Africa has the second-highest number of cases on the continent - 61, according to AFP news agency. Most infected individuals had recently travelled to Europe. During a briefing on Saturday, the White House suggested domestic travel restrictions could be next. But the US infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Faucitold ABC News,externalon Sunday the move has ""not been seriously discussed"". ""I don't see that right now in the immediate future,"" Dr Fauci said. ""But remember, we are very open minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public."" There are currently over 2,900 confirmed cases in the US, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. There have been 57 deaths so far. Dr Fauci said he was confident that currently, the government was doing everything it can to control the outbreak. ""You've got to be almost overreacting a bit to keep up with it,"" he said, adding that people ""need to understand that things will get worse before they get better"". Dr Fauci (centre) says the government is working to prevent a worst-case scenario Â© 2025 BBC.

"Future of UK aviation at risk, airlines say","The UK's aviation industry may not survive the coronavirus pandemic without emergency financial support, airlines have warned. Bosses at Virgin Atlantic will write to the prime minister on Monday to ask for emergency financial measures for airlines in the UK. US travel restrictions will hit all transatlantic routes from Tuesday, further denting the aviation sector. The government said it was open to supporting firms, including airlines. In a stark message, industry body Airlines UK said the government's ""prevarication"" and ""bean counting"" had to stop. ""We're talking about the future of UK aviation - one of our world-class industries - and unless the government pulls itself together who knows what will be left of it once we get out of this mess,"" it added. Airline bosses have been talking to ministers. Last week, senior figures in the industry were said to be ""livid"" that there were no emergency measures for the aviation sector in the budget, whereas most other sectors of the economy received billions of pounds of support. ""This is the most challenging period for aviation and package holiday businesses we have witnessed,"" Richard Moriarty, the boss of the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Sunday. ""The threat to the survival of some businesses is real the longer this goes on,"" he said. ""They will need to take very difficult actions to secure sufficient liquidity."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The demand comes afterthe US announced it will extend its European travel banto include the UK and Republic of Ireland. The ban, which will begin at 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, will hit vital routes for the likes of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air. Meanwhile, American Airlines announced it is suspending nearly all of its long-haul international flights from Monday. On Saturday, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advised against all but essential travel toparts of Spain,externalas well as thewhole of Poland,external. The government said in a statement that it recognises the difficulties UK airlines are facing. ""We are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers,"" it said. ""We have influenced the European Commission to relax flight slots and HMRC is ready to help all businesses, including airlines, and self-employed individuals, experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus."" US adds UK and Ireland to coronavirus travel ban UK flights to virus-hit Spain turn around mid-air Under European law, if flights are not operated, designated take-off and landing slots have to be forfeited. Last week,Virgin Atlantic confirmed it was forced to operate some near-empty flightsafter bookings were dented by the outbreak. British Airways warned employees on Fridaythat the industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11. In a memo titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", the company's boss Alex Cruz said that it is to ground flights ""like never before"" and lay off staff. On Thursday,Norwegian Air said it was set to cancel 4,000 flightsand temporarily lay off about half of its staff.

"âWe have bus passes, but no busâ after cuts","Pensioners Betty Sharpe and Marion Crawford are relying on a charity bus service as their local services have been cut More than a million people in Great Britain now live at least a mile from a bus stop with a regular service, BBC research suggests. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said cuts to services had left some people ""trapped in their homes"". Bus pass use by older and disabled people in England has fallen by almost a fifth in a decade. The government has promisedÂ£5bn over five years for buses and cycling. However, Department for Transport (DfT) figures show local and central government support for buses has fallen by Â£800m a year over 10 years. Analysis of bus route data for theBBC's Panoramashowed 550,000 properties, equivalent to about 1.3 million people, are at least 2km (1.2 miles) from a bus stop with a service calling on average four times a day. Marion Crawford, from Lower Denby, West Yorkshire, said her local bus stopped about seven years ago, leaving her reliant on charity-run services. ""I'm not benefitting from my bus pass at all,"" she said. ""I don't know what I'd do without the community bus. I'd have no way to go grocery shopping or to the doctors, I'd be reliant on friends."" Marion Crawford [left] and Betty Sharpe both rely on their community bus scheme The 92-year-old said: ""When you go to the doctor and they say they want to see you again, your heart sinks, you think 'how am I going to get here?'"" Paul Jones, chief officer of the Denby Dale Centre, which provides a charity-funded bus service, said: ""Our members tell us some bus routes do not actually reach their villages any more and they feel left alone."" The charity has received grant funding from the government and the National Lottery for its services. Judith Lawrence has not left her village this year because of a lack of buses Judith Lawrence, 75, said she had not left her village of Helperby, North Yorkshire, at all this year because of a lack of bus services. No private operators run routes through the village, so the local council provides a minibus to take residents to a nearby town twice a week. ""I've got a bus pass but no bus,"" Ms Lawrence said. ""It's almost like a discrimination against the people in rural areas with low incomes who can't afford to take a taxi somewhere."" The lack of buses is also affecting people trying to get to work. Marti Blagborough says he has no choice but to use buses, which are not always reliable Construction worker Marti Blagborough said buses between his home in Farnley and Leeds city centre are often delayed or do not turn up. He said: ""If there's no buses there's no work, because we can't get there. ""You have to trust them, I guess you've got no other choice. ""If I lived locally I'd have the option of maybe bicycle to work and stuff like that but working further away it's the only option."" Fall in bus travel as car ownership hits record Government pledges Â£5bn for bus services and cycle routes Plans for first all-electric bus town Bus use has declined over the past decade along with a fall of about 10% in the number of miles covered each year, but it varies across Great Britain. According to annual DfT figures, the areas with the most steady declines in estimated miles travelled by bus include Blackburn with Darwen, which has seen a 42% reduction since 2014; Stoke on Trent (41% reduction); and North Yorkshire (41%). Martin Kelly, Blackburn with Darwen Council's director of growth and development, said the authority had invested in public transport but ""several travel companies in the area have stopped trading or have reduced the services due to falling passenger numbers"". He said other factors included austerity cuts to council funding, changing employment patterns and ""lower demand for traditional shopping patterns"". ""Our figures do seem to have stabilised, however, and we have recently been granted funding from the DfT which should allow us to increase certain services,"" he added. Stoke-on-Trent City Council said commercial operators' fares increase when usage falls, creating ""a vicious circle"". The council is bidding for funding from the government to improve bus reliability and provide more services. The government funds free bus passes for pensioners and disabled people in England but the number of journeys made with them has fallen by 18% since 2010. The DfT said part of this decline was due to the fall in pass holders because the age at which people can receive them has risen in line with changes to the state pension age. Darren Shirley from the CBT said: ""We're seeing people who are trapped in their home, essentially."" He said many people left without a bus service would be ""reliant on the goodwill of neighbours"" to get around. On average, pensioners and disabled people in England took 26 fewer bus journeys a year on their passes than they did in 2014-15, DfT data showed. In Somerset the number of concessionary journeys taken was down by 45%. A spokesman for Somerset County Council said it had reduced spending on concessionary fares for ""a variety of reasons, including reductions in both subsidised and commercial bus services"" and thecollapse of a bus operator in 2016. He added that the council continued to ""meet and exceed"" its statutory duties. A spokeswoman for the DfT said: ""Buses are crucial to communities, providing key links to work, school, shops and family and friends. ""We've pledged Â£5 billion to overhaul bus and cycling links, which is on top of the significant Â£220 million investment we've already made to make buses more reliable and convenient. ""We're also publishing a national bus strategy which will help transform local transport services in every region across the country.""

Elderly to be 'shielded' as PM seeks to equip NHS,"Boris Johnson is launching a drive to equip the NHS with more ventilators, as No 10 indicated it could soon step up measures to tackle the coronavirus. These include ""shielding"" elderly and vulnerable people - where they are kept apart from the wider population - and asking entire families to self-isolate. The government has faced pressure to do more to tackle the epidemic after the UK death toll rose to 21 on Saturday. Downing Street said it would continue to be guided by its medical experts. Its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) listed ""shielding the vulnerable"" and ""household isolation"" as the next steps to tackle the spread of the virus. The latter could see entire households told to self-isolate even if just one person falls ill. Meanwhile, the prime minister is to urge British companies to join a ""national effort"" to produce more ventilators and other medical equipment ""at speed"" to help the NHS deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic It follows strong criticism of the government's strategy from more than 200 scientists, who have written to ministersurging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has reached 1,140, while 37,746 people have been tested. Downing Street said its ""next planned interventions"" will come into force soon, and that it will publish models and data it has used during its decision-making process. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that government, local authorities, charities, friends and neighbours ""will need to be part of the national effort to support the shielded"". He also said the British public had ""never been tested like this"" since the Second World War and issued a ""call to arms"" to manufacturers, asking them to ""transform their production lines"" to make ventilators. ""Everyone will be asked to make sacrifices, to protect themselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to this disease,"" he said. Have symptoms:If you are experiencing a new, continuous cough and/or a fever - defined as a temperature of above 37.8C - you should self-isolate at home for at least seven days,according to guidance released on Friday by Public Health England (PHE).,external People with mild symptoms who are self-isolating at home are not currently being tested.All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Live with or been in close contact with a positive case:The seven day isolation period now applies to everyone regardless of where you might have travelled or if you have had close contact with a confirmed case. Read more here. An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week - but Mr Hancock said he hopes many of the measures ""won't be needed"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked for ""urgent sight"" of the draft laws and for a meeting with the prime minister to discuss the crisis. His party had already called on the government to publish the scientific modelling and data that it is using to form its approach. Meanwhile, a new public information campaign is to be launched featuring the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and a voiceover from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy actor Mark Strong. The campaign, which will stress the need for people with symptoms to self-isolate for a week, will appear across TV, radio, newspapers, social media and billboards. The increase in cases in the UK comes as people continue to stockpile food Of the latest deaths in the UK, eight were men aged over 80 and all were in ""at-risk"" groups. Prof Whitty said: ""I understand this increase in the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 will be a cause for concern for many. The public should know every measure we are taking is seeking to save lives and protect the most vulnerable."" Most of the confirmed UK cases are in England. There have been121 confirmed cases in Scotland,60 in Walesand34 in Northern Ireland. People who are self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested for the virus. The government said on Friday it estimated the true number of UK cases to be around 5,000 to 10,000. People visiting elderly and vulnerable relatives have been reminded to take extra care, afterthe government released new advice,external. Care home providers should ask anyone who is ""generally unwell"" not to visit, the advice says. Meanwhile, government sources saidmass gatherings might soon be banned in the UK to ease pressure on emergency services.It is thought a ban could take effect as early as next weekend.

What is Mark Carney's Bank of England legacy?,"Mark Carney is the first non-Briton to lead the Bank of England in its 325-year history Mark Carney steps down as Bank of England governor this weekend after almost seven years in the job. The Canadian oversaw big changes at the Bank, which was given more power in the wake of the financial crisis. He also led efforts to support the economythrough Brexitand thecoronavirus outbreak. Mr Carney will leave the Bank more open and diverse than when he joined in July 2013, but his tenure has not been without controversy. Here are some of the changes that happened on his watch. The world was very different in 2013. In the UK, economic growth was gaining traction, but unemployment was still high, at close to 8%. This led to speculation about the timing of the first post-crisis interest rate rise. The Bank believed the economic recovery needed more time to take hold. It wanted to reassure people that borrowing costs would not rise any time soon, even if growth picked up. Mr Carney had previously done this in Canada, which became the first G7 nation to raise interest rates after the global crisis. So the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates tried something similar. It said it wouldn't even start thinking about rate rises until unemployment fell to 7%. The Bank also added some conditions that would overrule this""forward guidance"". These included any signs of runaway inflation, or threats to financial stability. UK interest rates cut in emergency move What the rate cut means for you But unemployment started falling much faster than the MPC had anticipated, quickly dipping below the 7% threshold. David Miles, a bank policymaker between 2009 and 2015, was in favour of the policy at the time. He now says the various caveats made forward guidance confusing. The quick drop in unemployment raised speculation over interest rates. The Bank later changed its guidance to state that any rises would be ""limited and gradual"". Mr Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College, London, said: ""The problem always was that any explicit and public rule to guide future policy would need to be complicated and contain many caveats if it was one that allowed the MPC to react to unexpected events. ""But that meant the guidance was of the form 'we will do X unless Y or Z were to happen in which case, then unless Q has happened, we will...'. I think in retrospect we got this wrong."" Martin Weale, another former MPC member who voted against the policy, agrees: ""With hindsight, people found it much too complicated. I suppose they wanted a simpler story."" Mr Carney also came under fire for hinting at rate rises but not following through. MP Pat McFaddenfamously compared the Bank to an ""unreliable boyfriend""for sending mixed messages to British households. Mr Carney has stressed all guidance is based on an ""expectation not a promise"", with interest rate decisions always data dependent. Michael Saunders, who currently sits on the MPC, said forward guidance is very useful to people who don't follow interest rate movements closely. ""Giving general guidance on the direction of interest rates over the next quarter to few years is very useful, allowing [people] to make well-informed financial choices,"" he recently told MPs. Mr Carney also oversaw the Bank of England's introduction of plastic banknotes The vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 surprised investors, with the value of the pound plummeting against the dollar and euro. Mr Carney addressed the nationshortly after David Cameron resigned as prime minister in a bid to assure everyone that it was business as usual. He said commercial banks would have enough cash, and worthy borrowers would have no problem getting loans. The Bank was well prepared and would take all necessary steps to ensure economic and financial stability. Policymakers latercut interest rates to a fresh low of 0.25%, restarted its money printing programme and designed a new scheme to encourage lending in a world of low rates. Mark Carney addresses the press at the Bank of England in the wake of the 2016 Brexit vote However, some said Mr Carney's pre-Brexit interventions were too political. The Governor warned ahead of the vote that itcould tip the economy into recession. Separate Bank analysis said choosing to leave the European Union wouldhit economic growth, stoke inflation and raise unemployment. Mr Weale, a professor at King's college London, was involved in producing the Bank's pre-vote analysis. He said: ""The Bank was obviously in a difficult position. On the one hand people wanted to know its views. On the other hand it risked being seen as partisan if it offered them."" Interest rates were just 0.5% when Mark Carney joined the Bank of England. They're now even lower, at 0.25%. With little room for rates to go lower still, the Bank's interest rate setters had to find new ways to support the economy. As well as increasing the Bank's bond buying - or quantitative easing (QE) programme - policymakers started buying corporate debt in the wake of the Brexit vote. They also created a new Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to support bank lending immediately after the referendum. It offered cheap money - on the condition that commercial banks lent the cash to customers. This protected bank profit margins and got cash to worthy borrowers. Under Mr Carney's leadership, the Bank also took steps to rein in borrowing without using interest rates. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) took action in 2014 to prevent another housing bubble byimposing limitson the amount people can borrow to buy a home. Mark Carney talks to UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (left) ahead of the Budget. Mr Carney announced a new Term Funding Scheme targeted at small businesses to help them deal with the impact of the coronavirus Mr Carney's transparency drive means interest rate setters now meet eight times a year instead of 12, and publish information about those meetings alongside decisions. The reforms came after a review by former US central banker Kevin Warsh. While the changes have been widely welcomed, Mr Miles described a decision to publish transcripts of some of the MPC's conversations as ""wholly negative"". He said the changes came after pressure from the Commons Treasury Select Committee. ""My observation was that it much reduced the usefulness of the decision meeting because most of the MPC members - and Mark Carney was an exception - decided they would simply read out pre-prepared statements of their view and their vote. Debate and open discussion dwindled."" Mr Weale said he also started reading pre-prepared statements and described his comments as more ""stilted"". ""I became more reluctant to revise what I was saying in light of what other people had said."" Transcripts started being kept in 2015, and will be published with an eight year lag. Mr Carney has spoken out about climate change risks The governor has consistently highlighted the threat to the financial system from climate change. He has warned that extreme weather events like hurricanes, heatwaves and floods pose significant risks to banks and insurers, which could end up suffering heavy losses. Mr Carney and other global leaders have been trying to get companies to calculate their exposure to climate risks. It's a drive he will continue in his new role as UN special envoy for climate action and finance. Is this the digital future for banknotes?

'Future of UK aviation' at risk - airlines,"The UK's aviation industry may not survive the coronavirus pandemic without emergency financial support, airlines have warned. Bosses at Virgin Atlantic will write to the prime minister on Monday to ask for emergency financial measures for airlines in the UK. US travel restrictions will hit all transatlantic routes from Tuesday, further denting the aviation sector. The government said it was open to supporting firms, including airlines. In a stark message, industry body Airlines UK said the government's ""prevarication"" and ""bean counting"" had to stop. ""We're talking about the future of UK aviation - one of our world-class industries - and unless the government pulls itself together who knows what will be left of it once we get out of this mess,"" it added. Airline bosses have been talking to ministers. Last week, senior figures in the industry were said to be ""livid"" that there were no emergency measures for the aviation sector in the budget, whereas most other sectors of the economy received billions of pounds of support. ""This is the most challenging period for aviation and package holiday businesses we have witnessed,"" Richard Moriarty, the boss of the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Sunday. ""The threat to the survival of some businesses is real the longer this goes on,"" he said. ""They will need to take very difficult actions to secure sufficient liquidity."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The demand comes afterthe US announced it will extend its European travel banto include the UK and Republic of Ireland. The ban, which will begin at 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, will hit vital routes for the likes of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air. Meanwhile, American Airlines announced it is suspending nearly all of its long-haul international flights from Monday. On Saturday, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advised against all but essential travel toparts of Spain,externalas well as thewhole of Poland,external. The government said in a statement that it recognises the difficulties UK airlines are facing. ""We are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers,"" it said. ""We have influenced the European Commission to relax flight slots and HMRC is ready to help all businesses, including airlines, and self-employed individuals, experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus."" US adds UK and Ireland to coronavirus travel ban UK flights to virus-hit Spain turn around mid-air Under European law, if flights are not operated, designated take-off and landing slots have to be forfeited. Last week,Virgin Atlantic confirmed it was forced to operate some near-empty flightsafter bookings were dented by the outbreak. British Airways warned employees on Fridaythat the industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11. In a memo titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", the company's boss Alex Cruz said that it is to ground flights ""like never before"" and lay off staff. On Thursday,Norwegian Air said it was set to cancel 4,000 flightsand temporarily lay off about half of its staff.

Supermarkets ask shoppers to stop panic buyingSome UK retailers have started rationing products such as pasta and hand gels to stop them selling out.,"Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling. In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items. ""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds. It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely. In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"". The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked. Can you stop people stockpiling? Food bank shortage blamed on coronavirus panic Stockpiling 'will hit vulnerable', food bank warns ""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads. That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them. It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand. But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers.

Some scientists say UK virus strategy 'risks lives',"Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right) More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. In an open letter,external, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"". The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune. The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted. The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon. Their letter was published on the dayit was announced 10 more people in the UK have diedafter testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21. Meanwhile the government'sscientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised,externalthat measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"". Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based. UK virus measures will have the 'biggest impact' Why is the UK not shutting schools like other countries? Three reasons why the UK might not follow Italy The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole ofItaly has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks. On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday). And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus, In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"". The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries. On Friday, Sir Patrick suggestedmanaging the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy. This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease. EASY STEPS:What should I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease. But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option."" The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover. ""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said. ""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed."" This video can not be played Willem van Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"". But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted. ""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said. ""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence. ""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible."" In a separate letter to the government,external, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height. ""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said. ""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it."" ""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added. The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"". ""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

Schools could be shut for 16 weeks says Foster,"Five new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total up to 34 When schools shut in Northern Ireland over coronavirus it will be for at least 16 weeks, Arlene Foster has said. The first minister was speaking after a meeting between senior ministers from the NI Executive and Irish government. Two primary schools have said they will close voluntarily, the first primary schools in NI to do so. The two are Lurgan Model Primary School, in County Armagh, and St Scire's in Trillick, County Tyrone. Lurgan Model said it would close for the week, while St Scire's will close on Monday ahead of planned St Patrick's closures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Five new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in NI while a second person has died in the Republic of Ireland. There have been 129 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland whilecoronavirus deaths have doubled in 24 hours in the UK. The first and deputy first ministers met counterparts include Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar in Armagh on Saturday. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill were both still split over the issue of school closures. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for them to be shut immediately, in line with the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile,in a statement on social media,external, Lurgan Model Primary School said it remain closed all this week. The school said it was already due to be shut on Monday and Tuesday due to St Patrick's Day and will bring planned closures due for May forward to this week. It is the first school in Northern Ireland to close voluntarily over the outbreak. The school said it ""will not officially reopen until Monday, 23 March"" but will ""monitor the situation of this incoming week"". St Scire's, in Trillick, said the school would stay closed on Monday ahead of planned closures on Tuesday and Wednesday for St Patrick's Day. It added that the situation will be reviewed prior to Thursday. Speaking after the meeting in Armagh, Mrs Foster said that schools will close ""when we are advised on the medical evidence"". ""Children will be at home for quite a considerable period of time, given that when we do close the schools they will be closed for at least 16 weeks. ""Then of course you are into the summer period, so they will be off school for a very long time."" Ms O'Neill said all parties in the executive agreed schools would have to close but it was a matter of timing. Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for schools to close She said: ""In my opinion schools should close now. I think we need to be consistent across this island ""I think the fact that you can have two schools a mile apart and one school's open and one school's closed that's a very confusing picture and a very confusing message for the public."" Ms O'Neillfirst called for schools to close immediately on Friday, a day after she, along with First Minister Arlene Foster, said the executive did not believe the situation had reached that stage. On Saturday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for schools to close, after Archibishop Eamon Martin, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland,wrote to NI's education minister to ask him to consider closures. However, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the main differences between the two governments was over timing. He said the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish government shared the same objective in slowing the advance of coronavirus but it was inevitable there would be differences in how they approached it. He added: ""But the differences that exist are mostly around timing. ""What there isn't any difference about is our common objective, which is to slow down this virus in its tracks and push it back as much as possible and limit the harm to human health and human life."" Mrs Foster said both governments had ""very coherent messages"". Mr Varadkar also explained that the short notice of Irish school closures given to counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK was ""not how we intended it to happen"". ""I absolutely guarantee you I did not intend to make that announcement or speak to Irish people on the steps of Blair House in Washington DC,"" he said. ""We had a plan in place to move to delay phase. We had to bring that forward almost overnight."" This video can not be played Washing hands no longer ""a luxury"" â Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney He added that Irish officials gave ""as many people a heads up as we could, including authorities here in Northern Ireland"" but it was also ""important that the Irish people should hear the news first from me and from the government"". ""That's why the notice that we gave people here and elsewhere was so short but there was no perfect way of doing this unfortunately and I appreciate the understanding of the first minister and deputy first minister,"" he added. Health Minister Robin Swann, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney and Irish Health Minister Simon Harris also attended the meeting. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald - who was not at the meeting - said the UK's response to coronavirus ""should be rejected"" and is ""totally unacceptable in the north of Ireland"".

Virus fear strikes city centres,"Some shoppers on London's Oxford Street wore face masks As the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise, so too does the the impact on daily life around England. BBC News looks at how people up and down the country have been responding. Concerns about crowds certainly seem to have struck shoppers, with a number of shopping centres and high streets noticeably quieter than an average Saturday.

The city's Bullring shopping centre was markedly quieter than usual early on Saturday.

The same goes for tourism hotspots like Buckingham Palace where visitors could be seen taking in the sights wearing face masks. London's public transport system - known for its rush hour crowds - has been emptier in recent days. Street performers had fewer people to entertain in Trafalgar Square Retailers in Above Bar, Southampton's main shopping street, said they had been feeling the impact. Boots optician Carol Betts said five of her patients had cancelled on Saturday morning, which she put down to fears about close contact. ""I haven't seen any patients for more than two hours. ""We can't keep hand sanitiser in the store for love nor money - as soon as you put it out, it's gone."" Optician Carol Betts said many people had cancelled appointments with her Stall owner Vinnie Singh said footfall was down and blamed news coverage. ""You can see it today. The media is making it sound worse. Scaring and frightening people is not the way forward,"" he said. Longsands Fish Kitchen in Tynemouth said it was very much business as usual for them On the other hand, in the coastal resort of Tynemouth in North Tyneside, the outbreak does not seem to have deterred the weekend crowds. Longsands Fish Kitchen said it was very much business as usual, with a ""lot of footfall at both the restaurant and the takeaway"". While there had been a few cancellations, the spaces had ""very quickly filled up"", they said.

The UK government's chief medical adviser said the patients were all in ""at-risk"" groups from across England. The total number of confirmed cases in the UK has reached 1,140 while 37,746 people have been tested. It comes as the government revealed plans to boost the number of NHS beds and ventilators to treat people. British manufacturing companies are to be tasked with increasing the production of ventilators and other medical equipment, while the NHS could also buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals. In a conference call with manufacturers on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge them to join a ""national effort"" to tackle the virus. Downing Street says it has already been working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the nation's supply of ventilators. Earlier, the Labour Party and GMB union called for the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS. It comes as Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, warned that facilities for people needing oxygen and critical care beds would be the parts of the NHS that will come under pressure first as the scale of the outbreak increases.

""Infection can be spread to the baby in the same way as to anyone in close contact with you,"" it says. The increase in deaths is obviously alarming for the public - as well as being a tragedy for the families involved. What we don't know is the extent to which coronavirus played a role in their deaths. We only know they had it when they died. Every patient death announced in the coronavirus outbreak in the UK has been a person who has had underlying health conditions. That is a term that covers a range of different illnesses from heart disease and diabetes to asthma. There is certainly transmission of the virus within hospital - on Thursday three quarters of those patients with coronavirus in intensive care had not been abroad to an affected country. They may have caught it in the community and the Covid-19 illness they developed lead to their admission or they could have caught it in hospital when they were already ill. There are more than 1,500 deaths a day in the UK on average and what is certain is that growing numbers of people who die are going to have tested positive for coronavirus. People visiting elderly and vulnerable relatives have been reminded to take extra care, afterthe government released new advice,external. Care home providers should ask anyone who is ""generally unwell"" not to visit, the advice says. Meanwhile, government sources saidmass gatherings might soon be banned in the UK to ease pressure on emergency services.It is thought a ban could take effect as early as next weekend.

The government has said there was ""no need"" for people to do so but has also relaxed restrictions on delivery hours for shops to make sure they remain stocked. Online supermarketOcado has taken its app offline,externaldue to ""performance issues driven by continued high demand"" while the website has crashed for many users. Former MP Luciana Berger called for members of the public to ""look out for"" each other after she said she witnessed a man in a London supermarket refusing to give an elderly lady one of his packets of pasta.
