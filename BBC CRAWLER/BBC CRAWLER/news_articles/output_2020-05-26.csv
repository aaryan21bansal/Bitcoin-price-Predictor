France announces â¬8bn rescue plan for car industry,"President Emmanuel Macron announced a rescue plan for the French car industry during a visit to the Valeo car factory in Etaples on Tuesday The French government has announced an â¬8bn (Â£7.1bn) rescue plan for its car industry, which has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. President Emmanuel Macron's proposal includes â¬1bn to provide grants of up to â¬7,000 to encourage citizens to purchase electric vehicles. It also puts money toward investments to make France a centre for electric vehicle output. The plan comes as the industry braces for thousands of job cuts. In return for the relief, the two main French car producers Renault and PSA have promised to focus production in France. ""We need a motivational goal - make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,"" President Macron told reporters at a press conference at the Valeo car factory in Etaples, northern France on Tuesday. Coronavirus: Lufthansa agrees â¬9bn rescue deal with Germany Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case He added that no car model currently produced in France should be manufactured in other countries. To help sell the 400,000 vehicles languishing in car dealerships due to the coronavirus lockdown measures, President Macron said the government would also give people upgrading to a less polluting car a â¬3,000 bonus, as part of a scheme open to 75% of French households. ""Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,"" he stressed. Like in other countries, France's car industry has ground to a halt - with an 80% fall in sales and a backlog of nearly half a million new vehicles waiting for owners. President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one. The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a â¬5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries. The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The â¬8bn plan does not include an expected â¬5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade. The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Renault workers protesting outside the Fonderie de Bretagne factory near Lorient on Monday Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan. But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France. Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaperLe Figaro,externalreported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024. The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio networkEurope 1,externalthat they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.

John Lewis plans phased reopening of stores,"John Lewis is planning a phased reopening of its stores, using lessons it has learned on social distancing from the partnership's Waitrose shops. Changes will include having a customer service host to monitor numbers inside and answer queries, and fewer entrances. John Lewis and other non-essential shops in England can reopen on 15 June, with open air markets and car showrooms allowed to open from next week. However, there are questions over whether shoppers will return. Shops must install new safety measures,,externalbut there are fears too few customers will come in to make it profitable and to keep businesses alive. The British Association of Independent Retailers trade group said many small shops had been preparing to open from next week with safety measures. It called the 15 June reopening date ""a little disappointing for the smaller retailers"". Different rules apply in the devolved governments. The Welsh and Scottish governments are still advising lockdown, but are announcing updates on Thursday. Northern Ireland has started easing some lockdown rules, and is also due to give an update on the same day. Barista Kit Cockram and sweet shop owner Jeanette Walsh are both concerned that customers will not come flooding back immediately. ""Just because the businesses are open, doesn't mean that people will come, or that businesses will recover,"" Kit told the BBC. ""I feel like I could lose my job if we don't recover fast and efficiently enough. Or will I even be safe health-wise? ""Some customers can be a threat to cafe workers and can become hostile and rude."" Jeanette, who runs the sweet shop, Truly Scrumptious,  told BBC Breakfast: ""The big issue, I think, for a lot of business will be whether they get enough business coming in in those first few days to enable them to pay their staff."" And analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, from the Savvy retail marketing agency, told the Today programme: ""It is fine saying the stores can open, but are we going to have the appetite to go back? ""What we've seen during the lockdown is that people have shopped locally a bit more often. I think people will be concerned about going into big centres, places where they've got to get transport. ""We've been really quite pleased with the way that we've been able to get our non-food items online - and online sales have gone through the roof. ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to."" This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Jeanette has been busy preparing her shop for reopening safely. ""I have installed a new glass screen to protect my staff and customers,"" she said. ""I have reduced floor space so customers can only come in one at a time. And on the floor, both shop side and customer side, there will be signage to remind them of the two-metre distance ruling."" Meanwhile, the head of a car dealership has said that customers will be trusted to take test drives alone as part of safety measures when they reopen next week. Robert Forrester, chief executive of Vertu Motors, said his company had set up a number of measures inside their showrooms to become Covid-secure. And he told BBC Breakfast: ""When you actually go for a test drive, you will be the only person in the car. ""We trust the vast majority of our customers to do the right thing."" He added: ""It changes how we sell cars, but there are a lot of changes in how we sell cars. ""People are doing far more on the internet. Our online sales have gone up quite considerably over the period. ""We sold 650 cars last week as a group without a single test drive and not one person coming into a showroom."" All non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PM The shops refusing to pay their rent Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops Mr Forrester added that showrooms would look very different when customers are able to visit again from next Monday. ""They will have one-way systems, hand sanitisers, there will be people with masks and we've got perspex screens to protect the customers and the colleagues."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The managing director of Westfield's UK shopping centres said they were well-placed to cope with the new regulations. ""Compared to a narrow pavement on a High Street, the sheer scale of our centres puts us in a great position to safely manage the customer journey through our malls,"" Scott Parsons told the Today programme. ""We've got digital footfall trackers so we can safely manage crowds as they enter and exit we can impose one way systems and markings on the pavements."" Other measures imposed at the centres include car park controls and sanitisation stations. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said: ""We know already from the way supermarkets and food stores have opened that it is possible to sell goods - and for people to get the goods that they need - and to do so while respecting social distancing. ""We need to ensure that the shopping habits of people might have grown used to in the pre-Covid days, are habits that we all exercise a degree of restraint on."" Mr Gove said this included things like touching and testing goods, trying on clothes and trying make-up.

Minister quits over Cummings' lockdown actions,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross: ""There are unanswered questions I couldn't defend"" Junior minister Douglas Ross has resigned after Dominic Cummings' defence of his trip to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. The Scotland Office minister said the senior aide's view of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". No 10 said the prime minister regretted Mr Ross's decision to stand down. It comes as more than 35 Tory MPs have called on Mr Cummings to resign. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive 260 miles from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife - which he explained on Monday was for childcare purposes - dominated the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. Asked by a member of the public whether ministers would review penalty fines imposed on families who travel for childcare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I will have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer [that] in full and we will look at it."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, citing a government source, said Mr Hancock did ""not announce a review"" but would pass the concern on to his colleagues. Rev Martin Poole, a vicar from Brighton, said he asked the question of Mr Hancock because ""people feel a bit cheated"" and many feel a sense of ""unfairness"" about the story, adding: ""We want to all be treated on a level playing field."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to take away the question about lockdown fines During the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said he understood the ""anger that some people feel"" over Mr Cummings' actions, but added: ""My view is that what he did was within the guidelines."" Mr Ross, who remains Conservative MP for Moray, said Mr Cummings' ""intentions may have been well meaning"" - but thathe could not tell constituents who had been unable to visit sick relatives,externalduring lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right"". Who is Tory MP Douglas Ross? Timeline: What did Dominic Cummings do? Cummings' actions 'insulting to families like mine' Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Mr Ross' decision was praised by Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who called it the ""decent thing"" and a ""difficult decision"" respectively. Boris Johnson said he regretted Douglas Ross' decision to stand down At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Cummings saidhe did not regret his actionsand believed he acted reasonably and legally. Asked why, once in County Durham, he drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed coronavirus symptoms himself - Mr Cummings said he had experienced vision problems during his illness and was testing his eyesight to see if he could drive back to London. The drip drip of Conservative MPs calling on Dominic Cummings to go has continued on Tuesday. Now surpassing 35, it is around 10% of the parliamentary party. However, what's notable is that there are those who, even if they're not calling on Mr Cummings to go, have felt it necessary to write long open letters explaining their thinking to constituents. Public anger, it seems, has not been put to bed by Monday's extraordinary rose garden press conference. The prime minister's chief aide does, of course, have his backers; people who believe he did what was right in difficult circumstances. And one government minister suggested to me that the story has been ""whipped up"" by those who simply do not like Mr Cummings, either politically or as a person. But this saga is now into its fourth day, in a week when the prime minister wishes to communicate crucial messages about his plans for easing the lockdown. It is - another minister conceded - a ""problem"" and ""distraction"". And on Tuesday, as yesterday, the question remains, how much political capital is Boris Johnson ready to expend on keeping his chief aide? Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated the prime minister's support for Mr Cummings on Tuesday, saying the adviser had ""answered questions extensively"", while Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said his account was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". This video can not be played Cummings ""didn't break the guidelines"", says Gove Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw told the BBC Mr Cummings should resign as the row is ""distracting attention"" from efforts to combat the coronavirus. Among the Tory MPs calling for Mr Cummings' resignation is former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who said combating the coronavirus was ""more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street"". He is joined by William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove, who said it was ""humiliating"" to see ministers defending Mr Cummings, and Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who said the adviser had sent out a ""dangerous message"". Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told his South West Surrey constituents thatMr Cummings' actions were ""a clear breach of the lockdown rules"",external- but they were ""mistakes"" and he would not call for his resignation. This video can not be played Carlaw: ""If it were me, I feel it would now be time to consider my position"" Six opposition leaders have said in a letter to the prime minister that removing Mr Cummings from his post ""without further delay"" is the only way to restore trust in public health advice. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Green Party and Alliance Party said the issue ""transcends politics"". ""It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging,"" the letter read. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Meanwhile, the retired chemistry teacher who recognised Mr Cummings in County Durham on 12 April told BBC Radio Newcastle he has some regrets about his involvement. Robin Lees said he had had a ""difficult few days"" after his account of the encounter was initially rejected by Downing Street, but that he felt ""vindicated"" by the subsequent admission.

Coronavirus anti-viral drug 'biggest step forward',"Experts warn remdesivir shouldn't be seen as a ""magic bullet"" A drug treatment called remdesivir that appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus is being made available on the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began. Remdesivir is an anti-viral medicine that has been used against Ebola. UK regulators say there is enough evidence to approve its use in selected Covid-19 hospital patients. For the time being and due to limited supplies, it will go to those most likely to benefit. The US and Japan have already made similar urgent arrangements to provide early access to the medicine before they have a marketing agreement. The drug is currently undergoing clinical trials around the world, including in the UK. Early data suggests it cancut recovery time by about four days,external, but there is no evidence yet that it will save more lives. Coronavirus cure: When will we have a drug to treat it? The drug combination that may help us beat coronavirus It is not clear how much stock pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has available to treat UK patients. Allocation of the intravenous drug will be based on the advice of doctors. Minister for Innovation Lord Bethell said: ""This shows fantastic progress. As we navigate this unprecedented period, we must be on the front foot of the latest medical advancements, while always ensuring patient safety remains a top priority. ""The latest, expert scientific advice is at the heart of every decision we make, and we will continue to monitor remdesivir's success in clinical trials across the country to ensure the best results for UK patients."" Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds Medical School, said it was perhaps the most promising anti-viral for coronavirus so far. He said patients with the most severe disease would be likely to receive it first. ""Whilst this is clearly the most ethically sound approach, it also means that we ought not to expect the drug to immediately act as a magic bullet. ""We can instead hope for improved recovery rates and a reduction in patient mortality, which we hope will benefit as many patients as possible."" Other drugs being investigated for coronavirus include those for malaria and HIV. Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has beenhalted in some trials because of safety fears. The World Health Organization says the temporary suspension is a precaution, after a recent medical study found the drug might increase the risk of death and heart rhythm complications. In the UK, theRecovery triallooking at using this drug in patients remains open, but another one, using it infrontline NHS staffto prevent rather than treat infections, has paused recruiting more volunteers.

Scottish test and trace scheme to start on Thursday,"The Scottish government's new ""test and protect"" strategy will go live on Thursday, the first minister has confirmed. Ms Sturgeon said the scheme will mean anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 should take ""immediate steps"" to be tested. They and their household should then self-isolate until the results of the test are known. If the test is positive, people will need to provide the details of everyone they have had close contact with. These people will then be contacted by specialist tracers, and will need to ""immediately"" self-isolate at home for 14 days. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest updates Read the government's test and protect guidance,external This means they should go home from work straight away, and ""take care to come into contact with as few people as possible"" - although it is only if they are displaying symptoms or test positive that other people in their households will need to self-isolate. Ms Sturgeon defined a ""close contact"" as being: People within your household People with whom you have had face-to-face contact People you have been within two metres of for a period of 15 minutes or more Those contacted will not be told the name of the person who tested positive in order to protect their privacy. The first minister stressed that self-isolation means only leaving the house if it is to go for a coronavirus test - and not for exercise or to get food or medicine. She said the new scheme would see testing on a scale that has never been done before in Scotland. It will be introduced across all of the country's health board areas on the same day as thelockdown restrictions are due to be eased. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland now had the capacity to do 15,000 tests for Covid-19 every day through a combination of NHS labs, universities, the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service and the UK government's Lighthouse lab in Glasgow. She said about 700 contact tracers would be needed in the first phase of project - although a pool of 2,000 will be in place by the end of the month. Special contact tracing software has been piloted and will also be introduced on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon saying information will be handled by the NHS and will not be accessible by the Scottish government. Guidance will also begiven to employers,external""making clear they should support any member of staff who is asked to self-isolate through Test and Protect"", Ms Sturgeon said. People may be able to work from home if they feel well enough, but bosses should not ask people to go into work under these circumstances, she added. Ms Sturgeon also said the Scottish government has been in touch with the UK government to ""ensure that employment rights and entitlement to benefits, including statutory sick pay, take account of the fact that people might be off work or unable to attend appointments through no fault of their own"". There is no doubt that ""test and protect"" is asking a lot of people. It needs speed. Can the testers turn around results quickly and accurately - perhaps in under 24 hours - so that people know if they are positive? The role of contact tracers will be crucial. Will they be able to reassure people and ask the right questions, so they can make the right decision about who will be defined as a contact? While shoppers passing in a supermarket aisle might not count, this could affect large numbers of staff who work together. Could a whole fire crew be taken off the front line because a colleague tests positive and they can't socially distance at work? ""Contacts"" would be asked to self-isolate even if they have no positive symptoms or a positive test result. It is asking a lot of employers and their staff and could directly affect people's livelihoods. Test and protect will need public support - and the public to take action. The first minister said the new scheme would be crucial in limiting the spread of coronavirus as the country begins to open up again. And she said it should not be looked on as being optional - with everyone needing to play their part to ensure it is successful by agreeing to fully self-isolate when asked to do so. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Test and Protect is a really important tool for us in the period ahead. The more effective it is, the more of the lockdown restrictions we will be able to lift. ""It is going to require exactly the same spirit of solidarity and care for each other as lockdown has done. It will be a collective national endeavour."" A public awareness campaign will start later this week, with further information being delivered to every household in the country next month. Ms Sturgeon said testing in Scotland would be ramped up to unprecedented levels The Scottish Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's pledge on increased testing would be meaningless unless the additional capacity was actually used. The party said the Scottish government had rarely carried out even half of the 10,000 test a day target it had previously set, with leader Jackson Carlaw saying it meant that ""thousands of care home residents, workers and their families"" were going untested. Mr Carlaw added: ""Exiting lockdown will be dependent on this test, trace and isolate system, and we very much want that to succeed. But until the issue of testing is sorted, there is little hope that it will."" Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon also revealed that a total of 2,291 patients have died after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 18 from Monday. There are 1,200 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 69 from the previous day, and the number of people in intensive care has fallen by four to 36.

Labour names David Evans as new general secretary,"Labour has named David Evans as the party's new general secretary, with its leader saying he will help ""restore trust with the British people"". The National Executive Committee met on Tuesday to choose its most senior official after the resignation of Jennie Formby earlier this month. Six candidates were shortlisted for the post, but Mr Evans was thought to be favoured by the leadership. Some unions were thought to have wanted someone from the left of the party. One NEC source from the Labour left warned the leadership that ""members won't forgive them if they allow a hard-right general secretary to wage factional warfare"" against them. Mr Evans - who worked for Labour under Tony Blair - said it was ""an honour and a privilege"" to be appointed, adding: ""We face a defining period in the history of our great party, with a global pandemic, an imminent recession and a mountain to climb to win the next election. ""Through the strength of our movement, I know we can rise to this challenge."" Contest to become Labour's top official heats up Formby to stand down as Labour general secretary Jeremy Corbyn's senior aide to quit One of Mr Evan's first challenges will be responding to the findings of an inquiry by the equalities watchdog into Labour's handling of anti-Semitism cases within the party. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission's report is due to be published soon, with the party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, having already committed to accepting its recommendations and setting up an independent complaints process. Labour Against anti-Semitism spokesman, Euan Phillips, praised the appointment for being ""outside the hard left"", but said Mr Evans ""now has a huge job to tackle institutional anti-Jewish racism in the party"", adding: ""Actions not words will be the measurement of his success."" Mr Evans was regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, with his backers including Morgan McSweeney - Sir Keir's chief of staff. As assistant general secretary of the party between 1999 and 2001, he played a leading role in Labour's victory in the 2001 election. Sir Keir said Mr Evans would bring ""a wealth of experience to this crucial role and a clear understanding of the scale of the task ahead of us"". Deputy leader Angela Rayner said he would make ""a fantastic general secretary"", adding: ""Last year's election result was devastating for our movement. ""It is now our duty to work as a team to unite our party, reconnect with the British people and offer the better future that our country deserves."" But ahead of his appointment, some union leaders said Mr Evans - who left his previous position in the party to found a political research and consulting company - is a polarising figure who has historically sought to reduce the influence of the left. The NEC source also said Sir Keir and Ms Rayner were ""responsible for making sure [Mr] Evans fulfils their election promise to bring our party together, not tear it apart"". Ms Formby - who was a close ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn -left the role after two yearsby ""mutual consent"" following Sir Keir's election as leader in April. The choice of successor is seen as a crucial step in the new leader's attempts to unify the party after December's heavy election defeat and years of factional in-fighting. Allies of the new leader have a slim majority on the NEC after elections last month. But the committee, which is made up of MPs and other elected officials, trade unionists and representatives of local parties, remains finely balanced, after years in which it was dominated by supporters of ex-leader Mr Corbyn. The other candidates were Andrew Fisher, who worked as head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn, Karin Christiansen, a former general secretary of the Co-operative Party, Andrew Byron Taylor, the former head of the Labour group on Basildon Council, former MEP Neena Gill, and Amanda Martin, president of the National Education Union.

How scared should we be?,"Coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer. What could be more terrifying than that? A deadly pathogen we cannot spot, and then when it hits, we cannot treat. It is unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. People want to be safe. But the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were. There is, after all, a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences. So what should we do? Some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed. But those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty often describes these as the ""indirect costs"" of the pandemic. They include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness, financial hardship and damage to education. So as restrictions ease, society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks. Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the question we should be asking is whether we are ""safe enough"". ""There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community it's about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling."" She was referring to the row over schools, but the concept can equally be applied to many other scenarios. She says part of that equation depends on the steps taken by government on things such as social distancing, the provision of protective equipment and the availability of testing and then tracing of contacts to contain local outbreaks. She has been critical of the way the government has handled all of them. But as more freedoms are returned, the role of individual decision-making will come more to the fore. It is perhaps not about finding the right option, rather finding the least worst option. Statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk from Cambridge University and government adviser, says it has, in effect, become a game of ""risk management"" - and because of that we need to get a handle on the magnitude of risk we face. There are two factors that influence the risk we face from coronavirus - our risk of becoming infected and, once infected, our risk of dying or becoming seriously ill. If we are not in hospital or a care home our best guide to the risk of infection comes from the government's surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics. The data published this week suggests around one in 400 people is currently infected. The chances of coming into close contact with one of those individuals - certainly as we are practising social distancing even when out and about - is considered to be pretty slim. Although clearly some people, depending on their jobs, are at higher risk than others. The hope is that level of infection will reduce even further in time if the government's test, track and trace programme keeps the virus suppressed. Then if we do become infected, the fact remains that for most people, coronavirus is a mild-to-moderate illness - only one in 20 people who shows symptoms is believed to need hospital treatment. Those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk. Deaths among under-65s with no illnesses are ""remarkably uncommon"", research shows. Perhaps the easiest way is to ask yourself to what extent you are worried about the thought of dying in the next 12 months. What is remarkable about coronavirus is that if we are infected our chances of dying seems to mirror our chance of dying anyway over the next year, certainly once we pass the age of 20. For example, an average person aged 40 has around a one-in-1,000 risk of not making it to their next birthday and an almost identical risk of not surviving a coronavirus infection. That means your risk of dying is effectively doubled from what it was if you are infected. And that is the average risk - for most individuals the risk is actually lower than that as most of the risk is held by those who are in poor health in each age group. So coronavirus is, in effect, taking any frailties and amplifying them. It is like packing an extra year's worth of risk into a short period of time. If your risk of dying was very low in the first place, it still remains very low. As for children, the risk of dying from other things - cancer and accidents are the biggest cause of fatalities - is greater than their chance of dying if they are infected with coronavirus. During the pandemic so far three under 15s have died. That compares to around 50 killed in road accidents every year. So what seems crucial as we all try to balance risks is identifying those at significant risk of serious illness from coronavirus - whether we fall into one of those groups ourselves or have close contact with someone who does. Currently the government is asking 2.5 million people to completely isolate themselves. This includes people who have had organ transplants, are having cancer treatment and those with severe respiratory disease. On top of those, there are more than 10 million people who fall into higher risk groups. These include all the over-70s and people with health conditions ranging from diabetes to heart conditions. Prof Sarah Harper, an expert in ageing at the University of Oxford, has argued the ""blanket and arbitrary use of age"" needs looking at as the actual level of risk within this higher risk group varies enormously. Atool developed by University College London,externalhas attempted to tease out some of the differences in risk. Finding out more about these is going to be crucial as we move forward.

Call for clear face masks,"Kelly Morellon (right) and her mother Sylvie have designed a face mask with a transparent window It's now part of daily life for many of us - struggling to work out what someone in a supermarket or at work is saying when they're wearing a face mask. But for people who are deaf or have hearing loss, masks can prevent them understanding anything at all. ""You might as well be speaking in French,"" says Fizz Izagaren, a paediatric doctor in the UK who has been profoundly deaf since the age of two. ""I can hear one or two words but it's random, it makes no senseâ¦ When someone is wearing a face mask I've lost the ability to lip read and I've lost facial expressions - I have lost the key things that make a sentence."" It is a problem she shares with the some 466 million people around the world who, according to the World Health Organization, have disabling hearing loss. Standard face masks, which have become widespread as countries try to stop the spread of coronavirus, muffle words and obscure the mouth. But now charities and manufacturers alike are coming up with a solution. Fizz Izagaren says she feels isolated when everyone around her is wearing a standard mask Main dans la Main (Hand in Hand), an association which supports deaf and hearing impaired people in ChevriÃ¨res, northern France, is among the organisations around the world that have created a mask with a transparent window. Its founder Kelly Morellon worked with her mother Sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible, and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection. ""The basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them,"" Kelly told the BBC. ""But they are also very useful for autistic people, people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions. ""In any case, a transparent mask allows you to see each other's smiles, and at this sad time this could not be more important."" The clear screen in Kelly Morellon's design can be removed so the cloth can be washed Unlike some companies around the world - in Scotland, the US and Indonesia, for instance - Kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis. Instead, they are advising people on how to make their own andthere are multiple guidelines online to help,external. Their top tip is to use a little washing up soap to stop the plastic screen fogging up. 'I hope they'll make masks with cut-outs for lips' Mask wearing 'risks isolating' deaf people Why some countries wear face masks and others don't But one setting where homemade masks are not suitable - but where both PPE and communication are vital - is in hospitals. There is just one company in the US that has secured Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to make clear masks for clinical use. Five hundred of these masks are being used at Brigham and Women's hospital in the US city of Boston. At the moment they are being reserved for staff to wear when they are speaking to patients with hearing loss, or vice versa. Sign language interpreters, who use facial expressions and lip movements alongside body movements to create more complex and culturally rich signs, also wear them. James Wiggins, an American Sign Language interpreter, is among the staff at the Brigham who have been wearing the transparent masks ""When we saw the Covid-19 pandemic beginningâ¦ we soon realised there was going to be a challenge because of the escalated use of PPE and how that would create communication barriers,"" said Dr Cheri Blauwet, who leads the disability task force at the Brigham. ""We've had glowing feedback from patients and we're getting broader requests from other parts of the hospital, especially the paediatric floors."" In the UK, there are no approved manufacturers providing clear masks to hospitals. And the sole US manufacturer is not taking any more orders as it deals with overwhelming demand. Fizz Izagaren, a paediatric registrar at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey in the UK who is also deaf, says standard masks prevent her from taking patients' histories verbally. She also says she feels isolated at work because she is not able to speak to her colleagues. ""Clear masks should be the norm for everyone in a healthcare setting,"" she says. The elderly are both more at risk from coronavirus and more likely to have hearing loss She is now working with a product designer to try to come up with a mask that the NHS could use widely. But even once a design and a manufacturer are found, this could take time to roll out. In the meantime, there are concerns the current PPE could stop medical staff getting the required consent from patients. An intensive care nurse working in London, who is profoundly deaf, told the BBC she had one experience where a patient, who also had hearing loss, was not able to understand her or her colleagues when they were explaining a procedure. The patient could not give consent and the procedure could not go ahead. ""[Clear masks] would make things a lot easier for me,"" she said. ""I would be able to do my jobs properly and safely. I would have more independence rather than having to rely on others."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? In the UK,eight charities have written to NHS bosses calling for clear masks to be commissioned,external, warning of ""potentially dangerous situations"" arising from communication problems. NHS England has not yet responded to the letter, or to the BBC's request for comment. The UK government says it is supporting CARDMEDIC, which provides digital flashcards and other communication aids to NHS Trusts. There are also apps that transcribe speech into text on a mobile phone. But deaf workers say these workarounds are not always suitable for sensitive or emergency situations. ""As masks become more widespread in the community - it's going to get harder and harder,"" Dr Izagaren says. ""I'm worried the public are going to get more and more frustrated and there will be more discrimination towards the deaf community."" It is not just people with hearing loss who could benefit, she says. Experts suggest that other professions such as taxi drivers or even teachers may find clear masks useful as the coronavirus crisis continues. A niche product initially designed to help the deaf community, could in fact make everyone's lives better.

Minister quits over Cummings' lockdown actionsDouglas Ross quits the government as more than 35 Conservative MPs call for Dominic Cummings to go.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross: ""There are unanswered questions I couldn't defend"" Junior minister Douglas Ross has resigned after Dominic Cummings' defence of his trip to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. The Scotland Office minister said the senior aide's view of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". No 10 said the prime minister regretted Mr Ross's decision to stand down. It comes as more than 35 Tory MPs have called on Mr Cummings to resign. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive 260 miles from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife - which he explained on Monday was for childcare purposes - dominated the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. Asked by a member of the public whether ministers would review penalty fines imposed on families who travel for childcare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I will have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer [that] in full and we will look at it."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, citing a government source, said Mr Hancock did ""not announce a review"" but would pass the concern on to his colleagues. Rev Martin Poole, a vicar from Brighton, said he asked the question of Mr Hancock because ""people feel a bit cheated"" and many feel a sense of ""unfairness"" about the story, adding: ""We want to all be treated on a level playing field."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to take away the question about lockdown fines During the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said he understood the ""anger that some people feel"" over Mr Cummings' actions, but added: ""My view is that what he did was within the guidelines."" Mr Ross, who remains Conservative MP for Moray, said Mr Cummings' ""intentions may have been well meaning"" - but thathe could not tell constituents who had been unable to visit sick relatives,externalduring lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right"". Who is Tory MP Douglas Ross? Timeline: What did Dominic Cummings do? Cummings' actions 'insulting to families like mine' Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Mr Ross' decision was praised by Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who called it the ""decent thing"" and a ""difficult decision"" respectively. Boris Johnson said he regretted Douglas Ross' decision to stand down At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Cummings saidhe did not regret his actionsand believed he acted reasonably and legally. Asked why, once in County Durham, he drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed coronavirus symptoms himself - Mr Cummings said he had experienced vision problems during his illness and was testing his eyesight to see if he could drive back to London. The drip drip of Conservative MPs calling on Dominic Cummings to go has continued on Tuesday. Now surpassing 35, it is around 10% of the parliamentary party. However, what's notable is that there are those who, even if they're not calling on Mr Cummings to go, have felt it necessary to write long open letters explaining their thinking to constituents. Public anger, it seems, has not been put to bed by Monday's extraordinary rose garden press conference. The prime minister's chief aide does, of course, have his backers; people who believe he did what was right in difficult circumstances. And one government minister suggested to me that the story has been ""whipped up"" by those who simply do not like Mr Cummings, either politically or as a person. But this saga is now into its fourth day, in a week when the prime minister wishes to communicate crucial messages about his plans for easing the lockdown. It is - another minister conceded - a ""problem"" and ""distraction"". And on Tuesday, as yesterday, the question remains, how much political capital is Boris Johnson ready to expend on keeping his chief aide? Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated the prime minister's support for Mr Cummings on Tuesday, saying the adviser had ""answered questions extensively"", while Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said his account was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". This video can not be played Cummings ""didn't break the guidelines"", says Gove Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw told the BBC Mr Cummings should resign as the row is ""distracting attention"" from efforts to combat the coronavirus. Among the Tory MPs calling for Mr Cummings' resignation is former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who said combating the coronavirus was ""more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street"". He is joined by William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove, who said it was ""humiliating"" to see ministers defending Mr Cummings, and Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who said the adviser had sent out a ""dangerous message"". Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told his South West Surrey constituents thatMr Cummings' actions were ""a clear breach of the lockdown rules"",external- but they were ""mistakes"" and he would not call for his resignation. This video can not be played Carlaw: ""If it were me, I feel it would now be time to consider my position"" Six opposition leaders have said in a letter to the prime minister that removing Mr Cummings from his post ""without further delay"" is the only way to restore trust in public health advice. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Green Party and Alliance Party said the issue ""transcends politics"". ""It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging,"" the letter read.

Meanwhile, the retired chemistry teacher who recognised Mr Cummings in County Durham on 12 April told BBC Radio Newcastle he has some regrets about his involvement.

Disney closed its theme parks around the world - including Disneyland and Disney World - in January, in order to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In April, Disney faced criticism for stopping pay forabout 100,000 of its workers, as the US faced record levels of unemployment.

A Canadian province has launched an investigation into five Ontario elder care homes following the release of a damning report. The Canadian armed forces report included allegations that facilities smelt of rotten food, were infested with cockroaches and flies, and that elderly people were left for hours ""crying for help with staff not responding"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it ""deeply disturbing"". Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the document was ""gut-wrenching"" and said a full investigation would be launched, and that results of the inquiry would be shared with police should charges need to be laid. Canada's military has been assisting in a number of elder care homes that have been overwhelmed by outbreaks of the virus.

Cunningham (right) watches on as New York Gov Andrew Cuomo rings the market's opening bell earlier on Tuesday New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) President Stacey Cunningham has told BBC News that there was ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration to reopen the trading floor today after a two-month closure. Cunningham said the decision to reopen was made to help the smaller independent traders who operate there and ""who've not been able to earn an income for their families"". She told the BBC that only 25% of the trading floor has been allowed back, and that NYSE is working with health officials ""so that we can start a slow and cautious reopening with new precautionary measures in place so that we can limit the likelihood of an outbreak on the trading floor"".

Minister quits over Cummings' lockdown actionsDouglas Ross quits the government as more than 35 Conservative MPs call for Dominic Cummings to go.,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross: ""There are unanswered questions I couldn't defend"" Junior minister Douglas Ross has resigned after Dominic Cummings' defence of his trip to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. The Scotland Office minister said the senior aide's view of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". No 10 said the prime minister regretted Mr Ross's decision to stand down. It comes as more than 35 Tory MPs have called on Mr Cummings to resign. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive 260 miles from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife - which he explained on Monday was for childcare purposes - dominated the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. Asked by a member of the public whether ministers would review penalty fines imposed on families who travel for childcare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I will have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer [that] in full and we will look at it."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, citing a government source, said Mr Hancock did ""not announce a review"" but would pass the concern on to his colleagues. Rev Martin Poole, a vicar from Brighton, said he asked the question of Mr Hancock because ""people feel a bit cheated"" and many feel a sense of ""unfairness"" about the story, adding: ""We want to all be treated on a level playing field."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to take away the question about lockdown fines During the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said he understood the ""anger that some people feel"" over Mr Cummings' actions, but added: ""My view is that what he did was within the guidelines."" Mr Ross, who remains Conservative MP for Moray, said Mr Cummings' ""intentions may have been well meaning"" - but thathe could not tell constituents who had been unable to visit sick relatives,externalduring lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right"". Who is Tory MP Douglas Ross? Timeline: What did Dominic Cummings do? Cummings' actions 'insulting to families like mine' Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Mr Ross' decision was praised by Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who called it the ""decent thing"" and a ""difficult decision"" respectively. Boris Johnson said he regretted Douglas Ross' decision to stand down At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Cummings saidhe did not regret his actionsand believed he acted reasonably and legally. Asked why, once in County Durham, he drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed coronavirus symptoms himself - Mr Cummings said he had experienced vision problems during his illness and was testing his eyesight to see if he could drive back to London. The drip drip of Conservative MPs calling on Dominic Cummings to go has continued on Tuesday. Now surpassing 35, it is around 10% of the parliamentary party. However, what's notable is that there are those who, even if they're not calling on Mr Cummings to go, have felt it necessary to write long open letters explaining their thinking to constituents. Public anger, it seems, has not been put to bed by Monday's extraordinary rose garden press conference. The prime minister's chief aide does, of course, have his backers; people who believe he did what was right in difficult circumstances. And one government minister suggested to me that the story has been ""whipped up"" by those who simply do not like Mr Cummings, either politically or as a person. But this saga is now into its fourth day, in a week when the prime minister wishes to communicate crucial messages about his plans for easing the lockdown. It is - another minister conceded - a ""problem"" and ""distraction"". And on Tuesday, as yesterday, the question remains, how much political capital is Boris Johnson ready to expend on keeping his chief aide? Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated the prime minister's support for Mr Cummings on Tuesday, saying the adviser had ""answered questions extensively"", while Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said his account was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". This video can not be played Cummings ""didn't break the guidelines"", says Gove Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw told the BBC Mr Cummings should resign as the row is ""distracting attention"" from efforts to combat the coronavirus. Among the Tory MPs calling for Mr Cummings' resignation is former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who said combating the coronavirus was ""more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street"". He is joined by William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove, who said it was ""humiliating"" to see ministers defending Mr Cummings, and Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who said the adviser had sent out a ""dangerous message"". Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told his South West Surrey constituents thatMr Cummings' actions were ""a clear breach of the lockdown rules"",external- but they were ""mistakes"" and he would not call for his resignation. This video can not be played Carlaw: ""If it were me, I feel it would now be time to consider my position"" Six opposition leaders have said in a letter to the prime minister that removing Mr Cummings from his post ""without further delay"" is the only way to restore trust in public health advice. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Green Party and Alliance Party said the issue ""transcends politics"". ""It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging,"" the letter read.

Meanwhile, the retired chemistry teacher who recognised Mr Cummings in County Durham on 12 April told BBC Radio Newcastle he has some regrets about his involvement.

Staff at hospital shut by Covid-19 cases 'worried'Weston General Hospital is not accepting new patients due to a high number of coronavirus cases.,"The hospital in Weston-super-Mare has temporarily stopped accepting new patients The temporary closure of Weston General Hospital has left staff ""worried and confused"", a trade union has said. On Monday, the hospital in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset,stopped accepting new patientsdue to a high number of coronavirus cases. Unison representative Liz French said the staff are ""confused, they're worried"" but are ""pulling together to do their best"". The hospital said new patients would be accepted ""as soon as possible"". ""It's not just the patients that have been diagnosed with Covid-19 but also lots of the staff because they've done lots of testing over the past week or so,"" Ms French added. ""They were unhappy but they were getting on with their jobs."" She said staff felt there was a lack of communication from bosses. ""Although the senior management team were meeting every couple of days to discuss the way forward but that wasn't getting down to the staff. ""That was the biggest problem and that's why they were so worried,"" she said. Dr William Oldfield, medical director at the trust, said there was a ""high number"" of patients with coronavirus in the hospital, adding that there was also ""an emerging picture of asymptomatic staff"" testing positive for the virus. ""Any members of staff who have tested positive have self-isolated in line with national guidance,"" he said. ""We are also in the process of testing all staff in clinical areas at the hospital who may have had some patient contact."" The University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, has not commented regarding the union's concerns about the communication of information with staff. Dr Oldfield said arrangements were in place for emergency referrals to go to other healthcare providers and that new patients would ""continue to have access to treatment and care in other appropriate healthcare settings"".

Unison representative Liz French said the staff are ""confused, they're worried"" but are ""pulling together to do their best"". The hospital said new patients would be accepted ""as soon as possible"". ""It's not just the patients that have been diagnosed with Covid-19 but also lots of the staff because they've done lots of testing over the past week or so,"" Ms French added. ""They were unhappy but they were getting on with their jobs."" She said staff felt there was a lack of communication from bosses. ""Although the senior management team were meeting every couple of days to discuss the way forward but that wasn't getting down to the staff. ""That was the biggest problem and that's why they were so worried,"" she said. Dr William Oldfield, medical director at the trust, said there was a ""high number"" of patients with coronavirus in the hospital, adding that there was also ""an emerging picture of asymptomatic staff"" testing positive for the virus. ""Any members of staff who have tested positive have self-isolated in line with national guidance,"" he said. ""We are also in the process of testing all staff in clinical areas at the hospital who may have had some patient contact."" The University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, has not commented regarding the union's concerns about the communication of information with staff. Dr Oldfield said arrangements were in place for emergency referrals to go to other healthcare providers and that new patients would ""continue to have access to treatment and care in other appropriate healthcare settings"". ""We are continuing to take the necessary steps with the aim of reopening the A&E department and accepting new patients as soon as possible,"" he added.

White woman called police on black man in dog row,"Christian Cooper filmed Amy Cooper after she refused to stop her dog running through woodland A white woman who called the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York City's Central Park has been fired from her job with an investment firm. Franklin Templeton announced on Twitter on Tuesday it had sacked an employee, ""effective immediately"". ""We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton,"" the tweet said. Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, asked the woman to leash her dog because he feared it could endanger wildlife. Mr Cooper and the woman, identified as Amy Cooper (no relation) were in a part of Central Park called the Ramble, a popular area for bird watchers where dogs must be leashed at all times, according to the rules. Mr Cooper said their exchange began when he noticed Ms Cooper's dog ""tearing through the plantings"" in the area. ""Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there,"" Mr Cooper said he told her, but she refused to restrain her dog. When he began filming, Ms Cooper told him she would phone police and tell them ""there's an African-American man threatening my life"". She then called the emergency operator and repeated, ""He's African-American"", before pleading for them to send an officer. A video filmed by Mr Cooper and posted on social media went viral on Monday, drawing tens of millions of views and prompting discussions about the high number of killings of black men by police in the US.

Ms Cooper later apologised, saying she had ""overreacted"". ""I sincerely and humbly apologise to everyone, especially to that man, his family,"" she told NBC News. Ms Cooper also faced accusations of animal cruelty, after she appeared to choke the animal with its leash while restraining it to call the police. After the video went viral she returned the dog to a shelter. ""The dog is now in our rescue's care and he is safe and in good health,"" the organisation wrote on Facebook. Her now-deleted LinkedIn and Instagram profiles suggested she might be Canadian. Detroit bank calls police on man depositing a cheque Viewpoint: Why racism is worse in the US than Europe New York police officer in 'I can't breathe' death fired Franklin Templeton initially suspended Ms Cooper while it investigated the incident, before announcing her sacking. Speaking to NBC News, Mr Cooper raised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February. ""We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that,"" he said.

Minister quits over Cummings' lockdown actionsDouglas Ross quits the government as more than 30 Tory MPs call for Dominic Cummings to quit.,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross: ""There are unanswered questions I couldn't defend"" Junior minister Douglas Ross has resigned after Dominic Cummings' defence of his trip to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. The Scotland Office minister said the senior aide's view of the government guidance was ""not shared by the vast majority of people"". No 10 said the prime minister regretted Mr Ross's decision to stand down. It comes as more than 35 Tory MPs have called on Mr Cummings to resign. Mr Cummings' decision in March to drive 260 miles from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife - which he explained on Monday was for childcare purposes - dominated the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. Asked by a member of the public whether ministers would review penalty fines imposed on families who travel for childcare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I will have to talk to my Treasury colleagues before I can answer [that] in full and we will look at it."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, citing a government source, said Mr Hancock did ""not announce a review"" but would pass the concern on to his colleagues. Rev Martin Poole, a vicar from Brighton, said he asked the question of Mr Hancock because ""people feel a bit cheated"" and many feel a sense of ""unfairness"" about the story, adding: ""We want to all be treated on a level playing field."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to take away the question about lockdown fines During the No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock said he understood the ""anger that some people feel"" over Mr Cummings' actions, but added: ""My view is that what he did was within the guidelines."" Mr Ross, who remains Conservative MP for Moray, said Mr Cummings' ""intentions may have been well meaning"" - but thathe could not tell constituents who had been unable to visit sick relatives,externalduring lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right"". Who is Tory MP Douglas Ross? Timeline: What did Dominic Cummings do? Cummings' actions 'insulting to families like mine' Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Mr Ross' decision was praised by Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who called it the ""decent thing"" and a ""difficult decision"" respectively. Boris Johnson said he regretted Douglas Ross' decision to stand down At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Cummings saidhe did not regret his actionsand believed he acted reasonably and legally. Asked why, once in County Durham, he drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed coronavirus symptoms himself - Mr Cummings said he had experienced vision problems during his illness and was testing his eyesight to see if he could drive back to London. The drip drip of Conservative MPs calling on Dominic Cummings to go has continued on Tuesday. Now surpassing 35, it is around 10% of the parliamentary party. However, what's notable is that there are those who, even if they're not calling on Mr Cummings to go, have felt it necessary to write long open letters explaining their thinking to constituents. Public anger, it seems, has not been put to bed by Monday's extraordinary rose garden press conference. The prime minister's chief aide does, of course, have his backers; people who believe he did what was right in difficult circumstances. And one government minister suggested to me that the story has been ""whipped up"" by those who simply do not like Mr Cummings, either politically or as a person. But this saga is now into its fourth day, in a week when the prime minister wishes to communicate crucial messages about his plans for easing the lockdown. It is - another minister conceded - a ""problem"" and ""distraction"". And on Tuesday, as yesterday, the question remains, how much political capital is Boris Johnson ready to expend on keeping his chief aide? Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated the prime minister's support for Mr Cummings on Tuesday, saying the adviser had ""answered questions extensively"", while Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said his account was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". This video can not be played Cummings ""didn't break the guidelines"", says Gove Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw told the BBC Mr Cummings should resign as the row is ""distracting attention"" from efforts to combat the coronavirus. Among the Tory MPs calling for Mr Cummings' resignation is former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who said combating the coronavirus was ""more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street"". He is joined by William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove, who said it was ""humiliating"" to see ministers defending Mr Cummings, and Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who said the adviser had sent out a ""dangerous message"". Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told his South West Surrey constituents thatMr Cummings' actions were ""a clear breach of the lockdown rules"",external- but they were ""mistakes"" and he would not call for his resignation. This video can not be played Carlaw: ""If it were me, I feel it would now be time to consider my position"" Six opposition leaders have said in a letter to the prime minister that removing Mr Cummings from his post ""without further delay"" is the only way to restore trust in public health advice. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Green Party and Alliance Party said the issue ""transcends politics"". ""It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging,"" the letter read.

Meanwhile, the retired chemistry teacher who recognised Mr Cummings in County Durham on 12 April told BBC Radio Newcastle he has some regrets about his involvement. Robin Lees said he had had a ""difficult few days"" after his account of the encounter was initially rejected by Downing Street, but that he felt ""vindicated"" by the subsequent admission.

Anti-viral drug that speeds recovery offered by NHS,"Experts warn remdesivir shouldn't be seen as a ""magic bullet"" A drug treatment called remdesivir that appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus is being made available on the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began. Remdesivir is an anti-viral medicine that has been used against Ebola. UK regulators say there is enough evidence to approve its use in selected Covid-19 hospital patients. For the time being and due to limited supplies, it will go to those most likely to benefit. The US and Japan have already made similar urgent arrangements to provide early access to the medicine before they have a marketing agreement. The drug is currently undergoing clinical trials around the world, including in the UK. Early data suggests it cancut recovery time by about four days,external, but there is no evidence yet that it will save more lives. Coronavirus cure: When will we have a drug to treat it? The drug combination that may help us beat coronavirus It is not clear how much stock pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has available to treat UK patients. Allocation of the intravenous drug will be based on the advice of doctors. Minister for Innovation Lord Bethell said: ""This shows fantastic progress. As we navigate this unprecedented period, we must be on the front foot of the latest medical advancements, while always ensuring patient safety remains a top priority. ""The latest, expert scientific advice is at the heart of every decision we make, and we will continue to monitor remdesivir's success in clinical trials across the country to ensure the best results for UK patients."" Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds Medical School, said it was perhaps the most promising anti-viral for coronavirus so far. He said patients with the most severe disease would be likely to receive it first. ""Whilst this is clearly the most ethically sound approach, it also means that we ought not to expect the drug to immediately act as a magic bullet. ""We can instead hope for improved recovery rates and a reduction in patient mortality, which we hope will benefit as many patients as possible."" Other drugs being investigated for coronavirus include those for malaria and HIV. Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has beenhalted in some trials because of safety fears. The World Health Organization says the temporary suspension is a precaution, after a recent medical study found the drug might increase the risk of death and heart rhythm complications. In the UK, theRecovery triallooking at using this drug in patients remains open, but another one, using it infrontline NHS staffto prevent rather than treat infections, has paused recruiting more volunteers.

Shoppers 'may be reluctant' to return,"John Lewis is planning a phased reopening of its stores, using lessons it has learned on social distancing from the partnership's Waitrose shops. Changes will include having a customer service host to monitor numbers inside and answer queries, and fewer entrances. John Lewis and other non-essential shops in England can reopen on 15 June, with open air markets and car showrooms allowed to open from next week. However, there are questions over whether shoppers will return. Shops must install new safety measures,,externalbut there are fears too few customers will come in to make it profitable and to keep businesses alive. The British Association of Independent Retailers trade group said many small shops had been preparing to open from next week with safety measures. It called the 15 June reopening date ""a little disappointing for the smaller retailers"". Different rules apply in the devolved governments. The Welsh and Scottish governments are still advising lockdown, but are announcing updates on Thursday. Northern Ireland has started easing some lockdown rules, and is also due to give an update on the same day. Barista Kit Cockram and sweet shop owner Jeanette Walsh are both concerned that customers will not come flooding back immediately. ""Just because the businesses are open, doesn't mean that people will come, or that businesses will recover,"" Kit told the BBC. ""I feel like I could lose my job if we don't recover fast and efficiently enough. Or will I even be safe health-wise? ""Some customers can be a threat to cafe workers and can become hostile and rude."" Jeanette, who runs the sweet shop, Truly Scrumptious,  told BBC Breakfast: ""The big issue, I think, for a lot of business will be whether they get enough business coming in in those first few days to enable them to pay their staff."" And analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, from the Savvy retail marketing agency, told the Today programme: ""It is fine saying the stores can open, but are we going to have the appetite to go back? ""What we've seen during the lockdown is that people have shopped locally a bit more often. I think people will be concerned about going into big centres, places where they've got to get transport. ""We've been really quite pleased with the way that we've been able to get our non-food items online - and online sales have gone through the roof.

Meanwhile, the head of a car dealership has said that customers will be trusted to take test drives alone as part of safety measures when they reopen next week. Robert Forrester, chief executive of Vertu Motors, said his company had set up a number of measures inside their showrooms to become Covid-secure. And he told BBC Breakfast: ""When you actually go for a test drive, you will be the only person in the car. ""We trust the vast majority of our customers to do the right thing."" He added: ""It changes how we sell cars, but there are a lot of changes in how we sell cars. ""People are doing far more on the internet.

Anti-viral drug that speeds recovery offered by NHSRemdesivir was originally developed as a drug to fight Ebola.HealthComments,"Experts warn remdesivir shouldn't be seen as a ""magic bullet"" A drug treatment called remdesivir that appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus is being made available on the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began. Remdesivir is an anti-viral medicine that has been used against Ebola. UK regulators say there is enough evidence to approve its use in selected Covid-19 hospital patients. For the time being and due to limited supplies, it will go to those most likely to benefit. The US and Japan have already made similar urgent arrangements to provide early access to the medicine before they have a marketing agreement. The drug is currently undergoing clinical trials around the world, including in the UK. Early data suggests it cancut recovery time by about four days,external, but there is no evidence yet that it will save more lives. Coronavirus cure: When will we have a drug to treat it? The drug combination that may help us beat coronavirus It is not clear how much stock pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has available to treat UK patients. Allocation of the intravenous drug will be based on the advice of doctors. Minister for Innovation Lord Bethell said: ""This shows fantastic progress. As we navigate this unprecedented period, we must be on the front foot of the latest medical advancements, while always ensuring patient safety remains a top priority. ""The latest, expert scientific advice is at the heart of every decision we make, and we will continue to monitor remdesivir's success in clinical trials across the country to ensure the best results for UK patients."" Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds Medical School, said it was perhaps the most promising anti-viral for coronavirus so far. He said patients with the most severe disease would be likely to receive it first. ""Whilst this is clearly the most ethically sound approach, it also means that we ought not to expect the drug to immediately act as a magic bullet. ""We can instead hope for improved recovery rates and a reduction in patient mortality, which we hope will benefit as many patients as possible."" Other drugs being investigated for coronavirus include those for malaria and HIV. Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has beenhalted in some trials because of safety fears. The World Health Organization says the temporary suspension is a precaution, after a recent medical study found the drug might increase the risk of death and heart rhythm complications. In the UK, theRecovery triallooking at using this drug in patients remains open, but another one, using it infrontline NHS staffto prevent rather than treat infections, has paused recruiting more volunteers.

"Turner Prize, UK's top art award, axed for 2020The often controversial prize is replaced by bursaries worth Â£100,000 to help struggling artists.Entertainment & Arts","Oscar Murillo's papier mache people were nominated for last year's prize The Turner Prize, the most high-profile award in British art, will not be given out this year because of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tate Britain, which has organised the prize since 1984, said it would be impossible to organise the annual nominees' exhibition. Instead, Tate will give bursaries each worth Â£10,000 to help 10 artists at this ""exceptionally difficult time"". Past winners include Damien Hirst, Grayson Perry and Steve McQueen. The last time it was not awarded was in 1990, after the award's sponsor went bankrupt. Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said: ""Gallery closures and social distancing measures are vitally important, but they are also causing huge disruption to the lives and livelihoods of artists. ""The practicalities of organising a Turner Prize exhibition are impossible in the current circumstances, so we have decided to help support even more artists during this exceptionally difficult time. ""I think JMW Turner, who once planned to leave his fortune to support artists in their hour of need, would approve of our decision."" The prize is named after the great painter, who hoped to leave part of his estate to help ""distressed landscape painters"" and ""poor and decayed male artists"" after his death in 1851. Tai Shani was also among the four artists who opted to split the award last year Farquharson added: ""I appreciate visitors will be disappointed that there is no Turner Prize this year, but we can all look forward to it returning in 2021."" The move to give equal amounts of money to 10 artists follows last year's decision to split the usual Â£40,000 prize between the four shortlisted artists. The nominated quartet successfully argued that their work was ""incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise"". New Banksy artwork appears at hospital How artists are depicting the coronavirus lockdown Hockney drawings offer 'respite from news' The prize has been controversial in the past, gaining infamy in the 1990s with nominees and winners including Hirst's cows in formaldehyde, Tracey Emin's unmade bed and Martin Creed's empty room with lights going on and off. According to the Tate's announcement on Tuesday, this year's judging had been at an advanced stage. ""This year's jury has spent the past 12 months visiting hundreds of exhibitions in preparation for selecting the nominees,"" it said. But the gallery said the decision to replace this year's prize with grants ""was made to help support a larger selection of artists through this period of profound disruption and uncertainty"".

Sports events 'shut down too late to save lives',"More than 250,000 people flocked to Cheltenham for its annual horse racing festival in March Two major sporting events held in March ""caused increased suffering and death"", the scientist leading the UK's largest Covid-19 tracking project has said. Data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus ""hotspots"" shortly after the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League match against Atletico Madrid. Professor Tim Spector said rates of cases locally ""increased several-fold"". The government said many factors could influence cases in a particular area. Less than three months ago sport across the UK was continuing as normal, despite the impending threat of coronavirus - which had already prompted some European countries to stage such events without spectators, or completely call them off. Sports governing bodies in the UK were taking their cue from Prime Minister Boris Johnson who declared in early March that people should ""as far as possible, go about business as usual"". On the first weekend in March, there was a full programme of football in both England and Scotland, five horse racing meetings, and Six Nations rugby at Twickenham between England and Wales - which the prime minister himself attended. It was a different matter elsewhere.  A forthcoming Six Nations match in Dublin had already been postponed, along with the Chinese Grand Prix and football matches in virus-stricken northern Italy. The UK government's stance remained consistent. Just 24 hours before Cheltenham opened its gates to 250,000 spectators on 10 March, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden rebuffed growing calls for a ban on mass outdoor gatherings. He told the BBC: ""There's no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage."" But Prof Spector from King's College London said ""people will have probably died prematurely"" because of the decision. Thousands of fans made the journey from Spain to Anfield So did these events contribute to a surge in coronavirus cases? It's impossible to say for certain, but figures seen by the BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme show in the last week of March, Liverpool and Cheltenham were among the areas with the highest number of suspected cases. The figures come from the Covid-19 Symptom Study, and show an estimated 5-6% of the population, aged 20 to 69, having symptoms in those two regions. Not to be confused with the government's contact-tracing app, the research draws on information uploaded by more than three million volunteers around the UK, who submit daily reports identifying whether they have any of the 15 symptoms associated with Covid-19. Five things the coronavirus tracking app tells us Melanie Finn left the Cheltenham Festival early because of concerns about coronavirus Irish journalist Melanie Finn recalls the stark difference in approach on either side of the Irish Sea, as she flew in to the Cheltenham Festival from Dublin. ""We had already cancelled the St Patrick's Day celebrations, and that in itself was huge for us,"" she said. ""People were in shock. No-one could believe that was happening. That was an indicator of how serious the Irish government was. When we flew out of Dublin Airport it was literally like a ghost town."" Melanie said that racegoers at Cheltenham, on the other hand, believed the UK government would have cancelled the event if they had thought it was unsafe. She said people ignored basic safety rules: ""It was like the last days of the Roman Empire, and I think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open, by God they were going to party."" She was so concerned by what she saw that she asked her employer to fly her home midway through the festival. A week later she developed the symptoms of Covid-19 and had to take two weeks off work. The Jockey Club had previously defended the decision to go ahead with the festival,telling the Guardian on 2 April,externalthat it had followed ""clear and ongoing guidance"" from the government and science experts. It added: ""We promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event, including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins."" On 11 March - the second day of the festival - the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic. Later that evening, Liverpool hosted Atletico Madrid in a Champions League football match at Anfield. Around 3,000 visiting fans were allowed to travel to Merseyside and mingle in bars and restaurants, despite the fact Madrid was the epicentre of the outbreak in Spain, and at that point accounted for almost half of the country's confirmed cases. Liverpool supporter Joel Rookwood, who has been ill for eight weeks, believes he contracted Covid-19 that evening, and recalled how when goals were scored, spectators were oblivious to the risk of transmitting the virus. ""The celebrations were some of the most physical that I've experienced,"" he said. ""People were jumping all over each other."" The Spirit Of Shankly, a Liverpool supporters group, said it raised concerns about the arrival of fans from Madrid at a council-chaired safety meeting two days before the match but were told it would go ahead in accordance with government advice. But Liverpool FC would not have been able to unilaterally call off the match - to decide which of the two clubs progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals. That decision would have had to come from one of football's governing bodies, such as the competition's organiser Uefa. Prof Spector said: ""I think sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier because they'll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldn't otherwise have occurred."" In a statement, the government said: ""There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age, general health, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve.""

White woman called police on black man in dog rowThe woman has now been suspended from her job at an investment firm in New York City.,"Christian Cooper filmed Amy Cooper after she refused to stop her dog running through woodland A white woman who called the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York City's Central Park has been fired from her job with an investment firm. Franklin Templeton announced on Twitter on Tuesday it had sacked an employee, ""effective immediately"". ""We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton,"" the tweet said. Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, asked the woman to leash her dog because he feared it could endanger wildlife. Mr Cooper and the woman, identified as Amy Cooper (no relation) were in a part of Central Park called the Ramble, a popular area for bird watchers where dogs must be leashed at all times, according to the rules. Mr Cooper said their exchange began when he noticed Ms Cooper's dog ""tearing through the plantings"" in the area. ""Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there,"" Mr Cooper said he told her, but she refused to restrain her dog. When he began filming, Ms Cooper told him she would phone police and tell them ""there's an African-American man threatening my life"". She then called the emergency operator and repeated, ""He's African-American"", before pleading for them to send an officer. A video filmed by Mr Cooper and posted on social media went viral on Monday, drawing tens of millions of views and prompting discussions about the high number of killings of black men by police in the US.

Ms Cooper also faced accusations of animal cruelty, after she appeared to choke the animal with its leash while restraining it to call the police. After the video went viral she returned the dog to a shelter. ""The dog is now in our rescue's care and he is safe and in good health,"" the organisation wrote on Facebook. Her now-deleted LinkedIn and Instagram profiles suggested she might be Canadian.

Branson space rocket fails on debut flightA California company owned by UK businessman Sir Richard Branson fails to launch a rocket to orbit.,"Cosmic Girl pulls away as LauncherOne ignites: The rocket's flight terminated shortly after Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company has tried unsuccessfully to launch a rocket over the Pacific Ocean. The booster was released from under the wing of one of the UK entrepreneur's old jumbos which had been specially converted for the task. The rocket ignited its engine seconds later but an anomaly meant the flight was terminated early. Virgin Orbit's goal is to try to capture a share of the emerging market for the launch of small satellites. It's not clear at this stage precisely what went wrong but the firm had warned beforehand that the chances of success might be only 50:50. The history of rocketry shows that maiden outings very often encounter technical problems. ""Test flights are instrumented to yield data and we now have a treasure trove of that. We accomplished many of the goals we set for ourselves, though not as many as we would have liked,"" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""Nevertheless, we took a big step forward today. Our engineers are already poring through the data. Our next rocket is waiting. We will learn, adjust, and begin preparing for our next test, which is coming  up soon."" Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Virgin presses 747 into space action The next rocket on the production line is in the late stages of integration The company is sure to be back for another attempt pretty soon - depending on the outcome of the post-mission analysis. The second rocket is undergoing final integration at the company's Long Beach factory in California and could be ready to fly within weeks. Most publicity about Sir Richard's space activities has focussed on the tourist plane he is developing to take fare-paying passengers on joy rides above the atmosphere. His satellite-launch venture is entirely separate. Orbit is chasing the growing interest in small spacecraft that are being designed for telecommunications and Earth observation. New manufacturing techniques, often involving ""off-the-shelf"" components from the consumer electronics industry, mean these satellites can now be turned out for a fraction of their historic cost. But they need matching, inexpensive means of getting into space - and the air-launched system from Virgin Orbit is intended to meet this demand. Sunday's flight illustrated the basic launch concept. The 747, known as Cosmic Girl, left Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles shortly before midday Pacific time (19:00 GMT / 20:00 BST), carrying the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, under its left wing. At 35,000ft (10km), just west of the Channel Islands, the jet unlatched the liquid-fuelled booster to let it go into freefall. LauncherOne ignited its NewtonThree engine four seconds later to start the climb to orbit. But it seems it didn't get very far. ""LauncherOne maintained stability after release, and we ignited our first-stage engine, NewtonThree. An anomaly then occurred early in first-stage flight. We'll learn more as our engineers analyse the mountain of data we collected today,""the company's Twitter feed reported,external. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Richard was not in attendance, but he was following events very closely, Orbit executives said. Although his space start-up is headquartered in California currently, he is keen to bring it to the UK also. Orbit is working through the possibilities with the US and British governments, the UK Space Agency and the local authorities in the southwest of England. Newquay Airport in Cornwall has been identified as an ideal location from which to base operations. Britain's enthusiasm is tied closely to that of its satellite manufacturing sector. The country is one of the biggest producers in the world of compact spacecraft. Will Whitehorn is president of the trade body UKSpace. He also initiated early design work on an air-launched rocket system when working for Sir Richard in the late 2000s. ""Everyone's attention right now is on the astronauts launching this week on a SpaceX rocket, but from an industrial perspective [Virgin Orbit] is just as significant,"" he told BBC News. ""If the coronavirus has taught us anything it is that our world is changing and space is going to be a big part of that. We could put so much industry outside the atmosphere. Take just the example of server farms. We know we could put them in space to harness solar power. It all comes down to the cost of access to space and that will be revolutionised by this kind of system.""

These were the main
developments on Tuesday:       A tissue factory is set to close because of coronavirus. Ninety-four workers will be affected by the plans at Northwood Hygiene Products in Penygroes, Gwynedd. A company spokesman said: ""As part of the review, various alternative options were considered, but the contraction in market demand as a consequence of Covid-19, and the subsequent significant fall in current and forecasted sales volumes has led to this very difficult decision being made."" A consultation process will now begin with employees. The company said production would be absorbed, and customers would still be serviced from other Northwood sites in Telford, Oldham, Birmingham, Lancaster and Bromsgrove. The Welsh Government's science advisors have said Covid-19 cases are ""most likely"" to be decreasing. They have revised down the potential impact of rates of viral transmission. The latest analysis suggests a reproduction rate, or R, of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. Initial estimates on 8 May suggested an R of 0.8 would lead to 800 more deaths and 7,200 if R was at 1.1 for the same period. The R rate is the average number a sick person could pass the virus onto. The latest paper from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) said with R in Wales analysed as below one, ""the number of cases is most likely to be decreasing"". It said R ""has decreased in Wales since social distancing and lockdown measures were introduced"". Families found camping on Halkyn Common in Flintshire, received a visit from a police patrol. Lockdown measures in Wales allow people outside to exercise and they are advised to stay close to home. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Swansea Conservatives have backed sacking Dominic Cummings ""if he is judged to have broken the rules"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior aide defended himself on Monday after driving 260 miles from London during the coronavirus lockdown. Mr Johnson has backed Mr Cummings while the Toryâs Scotland Office minister, Douglas Ross, has resigned over the affair. According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, Swansea Conservative Group said: âIf there has been any breach by Mr Cummings this should be judged by the UK government based on the account he has given and then the appropriate action should be taken. âIf he is judged to have broken the rules then we would support him being removed from his post."" The group claimed media reports had a ""personal vendetta"" against Mr Cummings and that the same level of scrutiny had not been brought against Welsh Health Secretary Vaughan Gething, or Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock. Mr Gething was pictured sitting eating chips with his family during lockdown while Mr Kinnock was contacted on Twitter by South Wales Police after he visited his father in London on his 78th birthday. It is not just people who need to learn social distancing. Guide Dogs Cymru have shared a video on Facebook showing how dogs are being trained to observe the two metre rule. Rob Roberts says people need to move on from the row A Flintshire MP has leapt to the
defence of Dominic Cummings in the face of a public backlash over histrip to County Durham during lockdown. Delynâs Conservative representative
Rob Roberts said the senior aideâs explanation of why he drove 260 miles
to his parentâs home was âreasonable and consistentâ and claimed his
brainpower was needed to tackle the pandemic. His comments were made at the same
time as several of his Tory colleagues backed calls for Mr Cummings to resign. The leader of the Conservative group
on Flintshire Council also said he sympathised with Scotland Office minister
Douglas Ross whostood down over the issue. However, Mr Roberts has now called for
people to move on from the row. âMr Cummings reports to the prime minister. If
his boss is satisfied with his explanation of events, I am inclined to move on
and get back to business,"" he said. âWe are still in the middle of a
national public health crisis. The focus now should return to that, without
this distraction."" Rob Roberts beat Labourâs David Hanson in December's General Election Friars Walk shopping centre is getting ready to reopen once lockdown rules are relaxed. Centre managers Cresco say they are waiting for âconfirmation from the Welsh Government that we are able to do soâ. Managing director Simon Pullen said measures would be put in place focusing on peopleâs health and wellbeing. He said: âThis will include a one-way system in the mall, floor vinyls to encourage people to keep their distance, and regular sanitising of key touch points such as lift buttons, car park machines and door handles.â   Police in Gwent dealt with numerous traffic offences, sending visitors to the area home, as well as shutting down house parties over the
bank holiday weekend. Gwent Police stopped 417 vehicles as part of ongoing checks
and seized âa number of vehiclesâ as a result. Speeding tickets were issued and there were arrests for driving
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. âWe are aware that we had a number of visitors who travelled
to the force area, and 52 people were advised to return home on Saturday alone,â
the police spokesperson added. âOur officers saw a number of motorcyclists turning around
immediately after seeing our presence on the roads. âWhile it is encouraging to see that the message is getting
across to people, we would like to re-emphasise the message of the Welsh
Government and the first minister: please visit Wales later. Now is not the
time.â Ynysangharad War Memorial Park in Pontypridd will reopen to the public on Wednesday, Rhondda Cynon Taf council has announced.

The party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts MP, together with other opposition leaders, said his removal was the only way to âreturn clarity and trust in public health messaging.â The letter followed revelations Mr Cummings drove 260 miles in March from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife. It has been signed by Westminster leaders of Plaid Cymru, the SNP, Greens and Alliance, the Liberal Democrats and SDLP. The letter has been copied to Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) chairman, Sir Patrick Vallance. Ms Roberts said:

Twelve new emergency childcare hubs are being set up in Rhondda Cynon Taf schools for vulnerable youngsters and children of key workers. The new services will open on 1 June, taking the total in the county to 25. The councilâs education director, Gaynor Davies, told a virtual cabinet meeting on Thursday that the number of key worker children and vulnerable children using the hubs had risen. TheLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid as many as 420 attended the current 13 in one week this month and 130 of those were vulnerable learners. Ms Davies said: âWe continue to work with social services to identify the most vulnerable and support families and carers to apply online to access one of the 13 childcare settings."" The council's Plaid Cymru group leader, Pauline Jarman, raised concerns some vulnerable children in Mountain Ash ward were not being offered a place. The RNLI has been criticised for not having lifeguards on beaches after two people died in England on bank holiday Monday. A teenage girl trapped beneath acapsized boat and a man pulled from the seadied in separate incidents in Cornwall. A councillor has urged lifeguards to ""get back to the beaches as quickly as possible"" to help save lives. The RNLI said it was doing what it could to get its service up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic. It is working with local authorities with the hope that it can provide a lifeguard service on about 30% of the UK beaches it usually covers this summer. The Welsh Government has once again stressed to people in Wales they should avoid non-essential travel.

The Funky Monkey children's clothing shop in Penarth A businessman who owns a childrenâs clothing shop in
Wales and another in England has called for clarity from the Welsh Government
over when he can reopen. Justin Horton opened Funky Monkey in Penarth five years
ago, and bought Chickadee in Cirencester last October. Yesterday, the prime minister said non-essential
retailers could open in England on 15 June. Mr Horton said that clarity allows him to plan for the
new safety measures, train his staff and start making money again, which he cannot do with his shop in Wales. He estimates the businesses have lost âtens of thousands
of poundsâ since lockdown. Local Democracy Reporting Service A Welsh councilâs
Conservative group leader has said there are âmore important issuesâ than
Dominic Cummingsâ trip to Durham during lockdown â but his fellow Tory councillors have
voiced different opinions on the issue. The prime ministerâs
chief adviser has said he does not regret the 260-mile journey from London and
that he had acted reasonably. But critics say the trip
broke lockdown rules and have called for him to resign. Newport councilâs Tory
group leader, Councillor Matthew Evans, refused to be drawn on whether or not he
backed Mr Cummings, adding he is âsick and tired of the whole thingâ. âI have not defended
him and I have not criticised him,â he said. âPeople locally have
bigger concerns about their jobs and prospects and when they will be able to
see their friends and family again.â But Caerleon councillor
Joan Watkins said Mr Cummings was right to put family first. âHe is a father first
and stand in that manâs shoes before you make judgements,â she said. Allt-yr-yn councillor
Charles Ferris also backed Mr Cummings, saying he had given âa plausible
explanationâ about the trip. But he conceded that
the issue does risk undermining the UK governmentâs lockdown rules. âIt does tend to
undermine what we do,â he said. âBut he wanted to
protect his kids first and I think his instincts overrode that.â Graig councillor David
Williams conceded that on reflection Mr Cummings might not have made âthe best
of decisionsâ â but he added that, as a parent, he âmight have done the same thing"". Dominic Cummings has said he behaved reasonably despite criticism of his trip to Durham The deaths of eight more people in Wales have been reported, taking the total to 1,282, Public Health Wales (PHW) has said. PHW publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals and only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories. Â© 2025 BBC.

Councils will take 'generation' to pay for virus,"It will take a generation for Welsh councils to pay for the coronavirus pandemic, according to the body representing them. Councils have built up a deficit of about Â£173m during lockdown, due to a loss of income and increased costs. Anthony Hunt, from the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), warned they were facing a ""recovery period of years"". The Welsh Government said it had made Â£110m available for councils. One of the concerns raised by local authorities is the spike in applications for council tax reduction, and the cost of the all-Wales ""Test, Trace and Protect"" initiative. Extra Â£23m funding 'to tackle Covid-19' in Wales Coronavirus 'costing councils Â£30m a month' Mr Hunt, the WLGA's finance spokesman, and also leader of Torfaen council, said: ""There's a risk that the legacy of the coronavirus won't just be a medical one but will be a financial one that damages our communities as well."" He added: ""I think it's far too early to talk about council tax going up, and I think that's a very undesirable outcome given the strain on people's finances thanks to this."" But Rob Jones, leader at Neath Port Talbot council, warned increases were inevitable ""to keep pace with what is going on in the world"". Community hubs for childcare have added to council costs, according to one council leader He added the potential cost of test and trace would be a ""heavy burden for financial and human resources"". All 22 Welsh local authorities have been asked how the pandemic has impacted them, and 19 responded. Some said increased costs included PPE, community hubs for childcare, free school meals, extra costs in social services, contact tracing, the Â£500 bonus for care workers, and expenditure on hospitals. The Welsh Government has so far funded additional expenditure incurred as a result of the crisis, with local authorities submitting claims on a monthly basis, as well as receiving two months' worth of its core funding in advance. Although some pointed to savings where services have been scaled back or stopped, four said loss of income - not currently covered by the Welsh Government - had been significant. This is from things including leisure centres, sports and performance venues, parking fees, moving traffic offences, rent on industrial units, licenses and trade waste. Gwynedd council said, depending on the duration of the crisis, its lost income could total between Â£5m and Â£16m. Cardiff council said there had been more than 5,000 new applications for the council tax reduction scheme since April - up 1,807 on the same period to the end of June last year, with the increase costing them about Â£33.86m. Guto Ifan, a research associate at Cardiff University think-tank Wales Governance Centre (WGC), said even before the coronavirus crisis, funding for local government was 14% below what it had been in 2010, meaning there was ""very little resilience in the system already"". He said increased demands on local authorities as a result of the crisis will be around for a ""number of years"", and that ""sustained increased investment"" would be required by both the UK and Welsh governments for a prolonged period of time. ""Relying on local governments increasing council tax might not be the answer,"" he added. ""We might have to look at using the more progressive income tax powers, for instance, that the Welsh Government now has, but those are debates to be had over the next few years."" If councils generate a deficit, they can sometimes use their reserves, provided they are not earmarked for other projects. The Welsh Government said it recognised the funding pressures placed on local authorities. A spokesman added: ""We have made Â£110m available immediately to help local authorities with additional costs and brought forward Â£526m of revenue support grant payments from May and June to support them. ""We will publish a supplementary budget next week, which will include up to Â£78m of further funding for local authorities."" A HM Treasury spokesman said the UK government announced Â£3.2bn of additional funding for all local authorities to ""respond to pressures across all their services as a result of Covid-19"". Lost income: Â£400,000 per month. Reserves: It may have to use reserves if expenditure exceeds the level it budgeted for. Spending: In March it received Â£52,000 to cover costs related to Covid-19. Its claim for April will be higher. Background: More people have applied for the council tax reduction scheme since the outbreak, and the council expects to have to write off more council tax debt than normal because of the pandemic. More homes on Anglesey are applying for council tax relief It is too early to judge the full economic impact of the pandemic as the lockdown measures remain largely in place. The council is in discussions with the Welsh Government about the financial challenges presented by the pandemic. Lost income: Â£4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£5m as a direct result of the pandemic. Reserves: May need to draw on reserves if financial pressures grow such as increase in applications for council tax support and current efforts to establish 'Test, Trace and Protect' services. Background: No staff furloughed. Medium-term effects could place more pressure on the council and these may not be funded by Welsh Government. Lost income: Â£3.2m since April. Additional spending: Â£4.5m since April on social care, the provision of PPE, community hubs for childcare and free school meals. Reserves: The use of them is under review in light of the pandemic. Background: The majority of the council's services are still being offered although some have been scaled back. No staff furloughed yet. Lost income: Â£11m by end of June. Additional spending: More than Â£18m by end of June as a direct result of Covid-19. Background: Further costs will come from work to establish 'Contact Track and Trace'. It has seen a significant increase in the number of applications for the council tax reduction scheme and is concerned about the ongoing recovery of costs as current funding arrangements are confirmed only until the end of June. Cardiff is projected to spend an extra Â£18m by the end of June No information provided. Lost income: Â£1.1m by the end of June Reserves: ""Sufficient reserves"" to cover any deficit for the immediate future. Background: No impact on debt so far. It said it was difficult to say what the financial consequences will be as it is uncertain how long the situation will last. The council was waiting to hear what support it would get from the Welsh Government. The council said it was inappropriate to provide information until it knows the level of support the Welsh Government intends to provide. It added the position will become clearer in the coming weeks. Lost income: ""Significant losses"". Additional spending: It has spent more on services such as social services. Background: The council has seen a ""sharp increase"" in applications for the council tax reduction scheme and this, as well as income loss, are two main areas of cost exposure. A former day centre in Queensferry has been used as a night shelter on an occasional basis in Flintshire since lockdown began Lost income: Expects ""dramatic"" income losses of Â£6.8m. Additional spending: Â£1.2m up to June. Background: Depending on the duration of the crisis, the council said it could see losses of up to Â£16m. It said there is ""an obvious need"" for compensation for lost income from the Welsh Government, and that expected income is ""unlikely to recover for many years possibly"". Referred to the WLGA figures, which estimated the total income loss of all Welsh councils to be Â£95m and total additional spending to be Â£101m. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Additional spending: Â£521,000 on costs relating to the pandemic. Background: It has reduced expenditure by Â£634,000 where services are not operating or are reduced, and the council has furloughed 240 staff. Funding announced by the Welsh Government falls significantly short of budgetary projections and it wants the Welsh Government to ensure councils will be able to borrow money as a last resort. Lost income: Â£4.9m. Additional spending: Â£5.2m. Reserves: It has Â£18m of general reserves which would be exhausted by next April if there was no further support. Background: ""Modest"" savings have been made through suspending services but future costs, such as the cost of keeping care homes running and contact tracing, needed to be considered. The council estimates it would lose Â£7.5m through reduced council tax payments and has already borrowed Â£20m from Public Works Loan Board to make sure it could deliver Business Grants as quickly as possible. Suspending services in the Neath Port Talbot area has allowed ""modest"" savings to be made The crisis is placing ""pressure"" on spending and income. The council said it was adjusting its financial forecasts because of the pandemic. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Spending: Â£3.8m by the end of June. Background: Recovery will be lengthy and complex. The main concern is loss of income, as current Welsh Government funding only covers additional expenditure. Reserves: Without further support its ""limited"" reserves could cover the deficit for four months. Background: The pandemic has had an ""unprecedented impact"" and Powys could have a deficit of Â£10m by the end of June, leaving the council with a ""bleak"" financial future. There is a risk the council ""may not be able to financially sustain itself"" for current financial year, while council tax receipts are down Â£600,000 from the start of the new financial year. Powys, home to part of the the Brecon Beacons National Park, could run into funding problems this financial year Spending: Â£4.5m a month on the pandemic. Background: It also had additional costs due to Storm Dennis at the start of the year. No information provided. No information provided. Lost income: Â£2.4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£2.4m of extra costs by the end of June including providing PPE, temporary homeless accommodation and free school meals vouchers. Background: ""Non-essential"" spending has been stopped but no permanent decisions have been made to reduce services. It has had additional funding but it's ""too soon to say"" whether this will be enough to cover all losses. The council said it was working with the Welsh Government and other councils.

"Shoppers 'may be reluctant' to returnShops will start to reopen in June, but will the customers return or will they stick to online ordering?Business","John Lewis is planning a phased reopening of its stores, using lessons it has learned on social distancing from the partnership's Waitrose shops. Changes will include having a customer service host to monitor numbers inside and answer queries, and fewer entrances. John Lewis and other non-essential shops in England can reopen on 15 June, with open air markets and car showrooms allowed to open from next week. However, there are questions over whether shoppers will return. Shops must install new safety measures,,externalbut there are fears too few customers will come in to make it profitable and to keep businesses alive. The British Association of Independent Retailers trade group said many small shops had been preparing to open from next week with safety measures. It called the 15 June reopening date ""a little disappointing for the smaller retailers"". Different rules apply in the devolved governments. The Welsh and Scottish governments are still advising lockdown, but are announcing updates on Thursday. Northern Ireland has started easing some lockdown rules, and is also due to give an update on the same day. Barista Kit Cockram and sweet shop owner Jeanette Walsh are both concerned that customers will not come flooding back immediately. ""Just because the businesses are open, doesn't mean that people will come, or that businesses will recover,"" Kit told the BBC. ""I feel like I could lose my job if we don't recover fast and efficiently enough. Or will I even be safe health-wise? ""Some customers can be a threat to cafe workers and can become hostile and rude."" Jeanette, who runs the sweet shop, Truly Scrumptious,  told BBC Breakfast: ""The big issue, I think, for a lot of business will be whether they get enough business coming in in those first few days to enable them to pay their staff."" And analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, from the Savvy retail marketing agency, told the Today programme: ""It is fine saying the stores can open, but are we going to have the appetite to go back? ""What we've seen during the lockdown is that people have shopped locally a bit more often. I think people will be concerned about going into big centres, places where they've got to get transport. ""We've been really quite pleased with the way that we've been able to get our non-food items online - and online sales have gone through the roof. ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to."" This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Jeanette has been busy preparing her shop for reopening safely. ""I have installed a new glass screen to protect my staff and customers,"" she said. ""I have reduced floor space so customers can only come in one at a time. And on the floor, both shop side and customer side, there will be signage to remind them of the two-metre distance ruling."" Meanwhile, the head of a car dealership has said that customers will be trusted to take test drives alone as part of safety measures when they reopen next week. Robert Forrester, chief executive of Vertu Motors, said his company had set up a number of measures inside their showrooms to become Covid-secure. And he told BBC Breakfast: ""When you actually go for a test drive, you will be the only person in the car. ""We trust the vast majority of our customers to do the right thing."" He added: ""It changes how we sell cars, but there are a lot of changes in how we sell cars. ""People are doing far more on the internet. Our online sales have gone up quite considerably over the period. ""We sold 650 cars last week as a group without a single test drive and not one person coming into a showroom."" All non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PM The shops refusing to pay their rent Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops Mr Forrester added that showrooms would look very different when customers are able to visit again from next Monday. ""They will have one-way systems, hand sanitisers, there will be people with masks and we've got perspex screens to protect the customers and the colleagues."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The managing director of Westfield's UK shopping centres said they were well-placed to cope with the new regulations. ""Compared to a narrow pavement on a High Street, the sheer scale of our centres puts us in a great position to safely manage the customer journey through our malls,"" Scott Parsons told the Today programme. ""We've got digital footfall trackers so we can safely manage crowds as they enter and exit we can impose one way systems and markings on the pavements."" Other measures imposed at the centres include car park controls and sanitisation stations. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said: ""We know already from the way supermarkets and food stores have opened that it is possible to sell goods - and for people to get the goods that they need - and to do so while respecting social distancing. ""We need to ensure that the shopping habits of people might have grown used to in the pre-Covid days, are habits that we all exercise a degree of restraint on.""

Sports events 'shut down too late to save lives'A top scientist criticises the staging of the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League tie.UK,"More than 250,000 people flocked to Cheltenham for its annual horse racing festival in March Two major sporting events held in March ""caused increased suffering and death"", the scientist leading the UK's largest Covid-19 tracking project has said. Data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus ""hotspots"" shortly after the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League match against Atletico Madrid. Professor Tim Spector said rates of cases locally ""increased several-fold"". The government said many factors could influence cases in a particular area. Less than three months ago sport across the UK was continuing as normal, despite the impending threat of coronavirus - which had already prompted some European countries to stage such events without spectators, or completely call them off. Sports governing bodies in the UK were taking their cue from Prime Minister Boris Johnson who declared in early March that people should ""as far as possible, go about business as usual"". On the first weekend in March, there was a full programme of football in both England and Scotland, five horse racing meetings, and Six Nations rugby at Twickenham between England and Wales - which the prime minister himself attended. It was a different matter elsewhere.  A forthcoming Six Nations match in Dublin had already been postponed, along with the Chinese Grand Prix and football matches in virus-stricken northern Italy. The UK government's stance remained consistent. Just 24 hours before Cheltenham opened its gates to 250,000 spectators on 10 March, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden rebuffed growing calls for a ban on mass outdoor gatherings. He told the BBC: ""There's no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage."" But Prof Spector from King's College London said ""people will have probably died prematurely"" because of the decision. Thousands of fans made the journey from Spain to Anfield So did these events contribute to a surge in coronavirus cases? It's impossible to say for certain, but figures seen by the BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme show in the last week of March, Liverpool and Cheltenham were among the areas with the highest number of suspected cases. The figures come from the Covid-19 Symptom Study, and show an estimated 5-6% of the population, aged 20 to 69, having symptoms in those two regions. Not to be confused with the government's contact-tracing app, the research draws on information uploaded by more than three million volunteers around the UK, who submit daily reports identifying whether they have any of the 15 symptoms associated with Covid-19. Five things the coronavirus tracking app tells us Melanie Finn left the Cheltenham Festival early because of concerns about coronavirus Irish journalist Melanie Finn recalls the stark difference in approach on either side of the Irish Sea, as she flew in to the Cheltenham Festival from Dublin. ""We had already cancelled the St Patrick's Day celebrations, and that in itself was huge for us,"" she said. ""People were in shock. No-one could believe that was happening. That was an indicator of how serious the Irish government was. When we flew out of Dublin Airport it was literally like a ghost town."" Melanie said that racegoers at Cheltenham, on the other hand, believed the UK government would have cancelled the event if they had thought it was unsafe. She said people ignored basic safety rules: ""It was like the last days of the Roman Empire, and I think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open, by God they were going to party."" She was so concerned by what she saw that she asked her employer to fly her home midway through the festival. A week later she developed the symptoms of Covid-19 and had to take two weeks off work. The Jockey Club had previously defended the decision to go ahead with the festival,telling the Guardian on 2 April,externalthat it had followed ""clear and ongoing guidance"" from the government and science experts. It added: ""We promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event, including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins."" On 11 March - the second day of the festival - the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic. Later that evening, Liverpool hosted Atletico Madrid in a Champions League football match at Anfield. Around 3,000 visiting fans were allowed to travel to Merseyside and mingle in bars and restaurants, despite the fact Madrid was the epicentre of the outbreak in Spain, and at that point accounted for almost half of the country's confirmed cases. Liverpool supporter Joel Rookwood, who has been ill for eight weeks, believes he contracted Covid-19 that evening, and recalled how when goals were scored, spectators were oblivious to the risk of transmitting the virus. ""The celebrations were some of the most physical that I've experienced,"" he said. ""People were jumping all over each other."" The Spirit Of Shankly, a Liverpool supporters group, said it raised concerns about the arrival of fans from Madrid at a council-chaired safety meeting two days before the match but were told it would go ahead in accordance with government advice. But Liverpool FC would not have been able to unilaterally call off the match - to decide which of the two clubs progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals. That decision would have had to come from one of football's governing bodies, such as the competition's organiser Uefa. Prof Spector said: ""I think sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier because they'll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldn't otherwise have occurred."" In a statement, the government said: ""There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age, general health, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve.""

New York Stock Exchange trading floor to reopenThe resumption of floor trading comes after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.Business,"This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different. The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading. New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths. Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening. US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at the New York Stock Exchange ""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine."" She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening. Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines. New York Stock Exchange closes trading floor US Senate passes bill that could delist China firms Nasdaq to tighten rules amid concerns over Chinese firms To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange. Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules. ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said. NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies. The NYSE's high-profile market debut celebrations have been put on hold The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity. Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business. ""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts. The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned. Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice. In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing. The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer. Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere. On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors.

Car dealership 'to trust customers' on test drives,"John Lewis is planning a phased reopening of its stores, using lessons it has learned on social distancing from the partnership's Waitrose shops. Changes will include having a customer service host to monitor numbers inside and answer queries, and fewer entrances. John Lewis and other non-essential shops in England can reopen on 15 June, with open air markets and car showrooms allowed to open from next week. However, there are questions over whether shoppers will return. Shops must install new safety measures,,externalbut there are fears too few customers will come in to make it profitable and to keep businesses alive. The British Association of Independent Retailers trade group said many small shops had been preparing to open from next week with safety measures. It called the 15 June reopening date ""a little disappointing for the smaller retailers"". Different rules apply in the devolved governments. The Welsh and Scottish governments are still advising lockdown, but are announcing updates on Thursday. Northern Ireland has started easing some lockdown rules, and is also due to give an update on the same day. Barista Kit Cockram and sweet shop owner Jeanette Walsh are both concerned that customers will not come flooding back immediately. ""Just because the businesses are open, doesn't mean that people will come, or that businesses will recover,"" Kit told the BBC. ""I feel like I could lose my job if we don't recover fast and efficiently enough. Or will I even be safe health-wise? ""Some customers can be a threat to cafe workers and can become hostile and rude."" Jeanette, who runs the sweet shop, Truly Scrumptious,  told BBC Breakfast: ""The big issue, I think, for a lot of business will be whether they get enough business coming in in those first few days to enable them to pay their staff."" And analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, from the Savvy retail marketing agency, told the Today programme: ""It is fine saying the stores can open, but are we going to have the appetite to go back? ""What we've seen during the lockdown is that people have shopped locally a bit more often. I think people will be concerned about going into big centres, places where they've got to get transport. ""We've been really quite pleased with the way that we've been able to get our non-food items online - and online sales have gone through the roof. ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to."" This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Jeanette has been busy preparing her shop for reopening safely. ""I have installed a new glass screen to protect my staff and customers,"" she said. ""I have reduced floor space so customers can only come in one at a time. And on the floor, both shop side and customer side, there will be signage to remind them of the two-metre distance ruling."" Meanwhile, the head of a car dealership has said that customers will be trusted to take test drives alone as part of safety measures when they reopen next week. Robert Forrester, chief executive of Vertu Motors, said his company had set up a number of measures inside their showrooms to become Covid-secure. And he told BBC Breakfast: ""When you actually go for a test drive, you will be the only person in the car. ""We trust the vast majority of our customers to do the right thing."" He added: ""It changes how we sell cars, but there are a lot of changes in how we sell cars. ""People are doing far more on the internet. Our online sales have gone up quite considerably over the period. ""We sold 650 cars last week as a group without a single test drive and not one person coming into a showroom."" All non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PM The shops refusing to pay their rent Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops Mr Forrester added that showrooms would look very different when customers are able to visit again from next Monday. ""They will have one-way systems, hand sanitisers, there will be people with masks and we've got perspex screens to protect the customers and the colleagues."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The managing director of Westfield's UK shopping centres said they were well-placed to cope with the new regulations. ""Compared to a narrow pavement on a High Street, the sheer scale of our centres puts us in a great position to safely manage the customer journey through our malls,"" Scott Parsons told the Today programme. ""We've got digital footfall trackers so we can safely manage crowds as they enter and exit we can impose one way systems and markings on the pavements."" Other measures imposed at the centres include car park controls and sanitisation stations. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said: ""We know already from the way supermarkets and food stores have opened that it is possible to sell goods - and for people to get the goods that they need - and to do so while respecting social distancing. ""We need to ensure that the shopping habits of people might have grown used to in the pre-Covid days, are habits that we all exercise a degree of restraint on."" Mr Gove said this included things like touching and testing goods, trying on clothes and trying make-up.

New York Stock Exchange trading floor to reopen,"This video can not be played New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different. The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading. New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths. Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening. US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at the New York Stock Exchange ""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine."" She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening. Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines. New York Stock Exchange closes trading floor US Senate passes bill that could delist China firms Nasdaq to tighten rules amid concerns over Chinese firms To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange. Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules. ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said. NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies. The NYSE's high-profile market debut celebrations have been put on hold The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity. Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business. ""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts. The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned. Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice. In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing. The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer. Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere. On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors. ""Any measures to enforce that are highly supported by us,"" she said. Trading - but not as we know it Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC reporter New York Before the coronavirus, I was a regular on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It may be one of the great symbols of US capitalism, but it's also, just a workplace for hundreds of traders, market makers, and various bystanders such as journalists. And like so many offices and shop floors it's not somewhere that you would ever associate with social distancing, keeping two metres apart and wearing masks. Quite the reverse - face-to-face stock trading is sometimes close to a contact sport, as is reporting from the floor. So the NYSE has to take its reopening very slowly. It will be a relief for some traders to be back to work, but it's not going to look like the trading floor we're all used to seeing for quite some time.

"Sports events 'shut down too late to save lives'A top scientist criticises the staging of the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League tie.UKCouncils will take 'generation' to pay for virusRaising council taxes would be a ""very undesirable outcome"", the local government association says.Wales politics","More than 250,000 people flocked to Cheltenham for its annual horse racing festival in March Two major sporting events held in March ""caused increased suffering and death"", the scientist leading the UK's largest Covid-19 tracking project has said. Data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus ""hotspots"" shortly after the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League match against Atletico Madrid. Professor Tim Spector said rates of cases locally ""increased several-fold"". The government said many factors could influence cases in a particular area. Less than three months ago sport across the UK was continuing as normal, despite the impending threat of coronavirus - which had already prompted some European countries to stage such events without spectators, or completely call them off. Sports governing bodies in the UK were taking their cue from Prime Minister Boris Johnson who declared in early March that people should ""as far as possible, go about business as usual"". On the first weekend in March, there was a full programme of football in both England and Scotland, five horse racing meetings, and Six Nations rugby at Twickenham between England and Wales - which the prime minister himself attended. It was a different matter elsewhere.  A forthcoming Six Nations match in Dublin had already been postponed, along with the Chinese Grand Prix and football matches in virus-stricken northern Italy. The UK government's stance remained consistent. Just 24 hours before Cheltenham opened its gates to 250,000 spectators on 10 March, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden rebuffed growing calls for a ban on mass outdoor gatherings. He told the BBC: ""There's no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage."" But Prof Spector from King's College London said ""people will have probably died prematurely"" because of the decision. Thousands of fans made the journey from Spain to Anfield So did these events contribute to a surge in coronavirus cases? It's impossible to say for certain, but figures seen by the BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme show in the last week of March, Liverpool and Cheltenham were among the areas with the highest number of suspected cases. The figures come from the Covid-19 Symptom Study, and show an estimated 5-6% of the population, aged 20 to 69, having symptoms in those two regions. Not to be confused with the government's contact-tracing app, the research draws on information uploaded by more than three million volunteers around the UK, who submit daily reports identifying whether they have any of the 15 symptoms associated with Covid-19. Five things the coronavirus tracking app tells us Melanie Finn left the Cheltenham Festival early because of concerns about coronavirus Irish journalist Melanie Finn recalls the stark difference in approach on either side of the Irish Sea, as she flew in to the Cheltenham Festival from Dublin. ""We had already cancelled the St Patrick's Day celebrations, and that in itself was huge for us,"" she said. ""People were in shock. No-one could believe that was happening. That was an indicator of how serious the Irish government was. When we flew out of Dublin Airport it was literally like a ghost town."" Melanie said that racegoers at Cheltenham, on the other hand, believed the UK government would have cancelled the event if they had thought it was unsafe. She said people ignored basic safety rules: ""It was like the last days of the Roman Empire, and I think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open, by God they were going to party."" She was so concerned by what she saw that she asked her employer to fly her home midway through the festival. A week later she developed the symptoms of Covid-19 and had to take two weeks off work. The Jockey Club had previously defended the decision to go ahead with the festival,telling the Guardian on 2 April,externalthat it had followed ""clear and ongoing guidance"" from the government and science experts. It added: ""We promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event, including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins."" On 11 March - the second day of the festival - the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic. Later that evening, Liverpool hosted Atletico Madrid in a Champions League football match at Anfield. Around 3,000 visiting fans were allowed to travel to Merseyside and mingle in bars and restaurants, despite the fact Madrid was the epicentre of the outbreak in Spain, and at that point accounted for almost half of the country's confirmed cases. Liverpool supporter Joel Rookwood, who has been ill for eight weeks, believes he contracted Covid-19 that evening, and recalled how when goals were scored, spectators were oblivious to the risk of transmitting the virus. ""The celebrations were some of the most physical that I've experienced,"" he said. ""People were jumping all over each other."" The Spirit Of Shankly, a Liverpool supporters group, said it raised concerns about the arrival of fans from Madrid at a council-chaired safety meeting two days before the match but were told it would go ahead in accordance with government advice. But Liverpool FC would not have been able to unilaterally call off the match - to decide which of the two clubs progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals. That decision would have had to come from one of football's governing bodies, such as the competition's organiser Uefa. Prof Spector said: ""I think sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier because they'll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldn't otherwise have occurred."" In a statement, the government said: ""There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age, general health, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve.""

"Councils will take 'generation' to pay for virusRaising council taxes would be a ""very undesirable outcome"", the local government association says.Wales politics","It will take a generation for Welsh councils to pay for the coronavirus pandemic, according to the body representing them. Councils have built up a deficit of about Â£173m during lockdown, due to a loss of income and increased costs. Anthony Hunt, from the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), warned they were facing a ""recovery period of years"". The Welsh Government said it had made Â£110m available for councils. One of the concerns raised by local authorities is the spike in applications for council tax reduction, and the cost of the all-Wales ""Test, Trace and Protect"" initiative. Extra Â£23m funding 'to tackle Covid-19' in Wales Coronavirus 'costing councils Â£30m a month' Mr Hunt, the WLGA's finance spokesman, and also leader of Torfaen council, said: ""There's a risk that the legacy of the coronavirus won't just be a medical one but will be a financial one that damages our communities as well."" He added: ""I think it's far too early to talk about council tax going up, and I think that's a very undesirable outcome given the strain on people's finances thanks to this."" But Rob Jones, leader at Neath Port Talbot council, warned increases were inevitable ""to keep pace with what is going on in the world"". Community hubs for childcare have added to council costs, according to one council leader He added the potential cost of test and trace would be a ""heavy burden for financial and human resources"". All 22 Welsh local authorities have been asked how the pandemic has impacted them, and 19 responded. Some said increased costs included PPE, community hubs for childcare, free school meals, extra costs in social services, contact tracing, the Â£500 bonus for care workers, and expenditure on hospitals. The Welsh Government has so far funded additional expenditure incurred as a result of the crisis, with local authorities submitting claims on a monthly basis, as well as receiving two months' worth of its core funding in advance. Although some pointed to savings where services have been scaled back or stopped, four said loss of income - not currently covered by the Welsh Government - had been significant. This is from things including leisure centres, sports and performance venues, parking fees, moving traffic offences, rent on industrial units, licenses and trade waste. Gwynedd council said, depending on the duration of the crisis, its lost income could total between Â£5m and Â£16m. Cardiff council said there had been more than 5,000 new applications for the council tax reduction scheme since April - up 1,807 on the same period to the end of June last year, with the increase costing them about Â£33.86m. Guto Ifan, a research associate at Cardiff University think-tank Wales Governance Centre (WGC), said even before the coronavirus crisis, funding for local government was 14% below what it had been in 2010, meaning there was ""very little resilience in the system already"". He said increased demands on local authorities as a result of the crisis will be around for a ""number of years"", and that ""sustained increased investment"" would be required by both the UK and Welsh governments for a prolonged period of time. ""Relying on local governments increasing council tax might not be the answer,"" he added. ""We might have to look at using the more progressive income tax powers, for instance, that the Welsh Government now has, but those are debates to be had over the next few years."" If councils generate a deficit, they can sometimes use their reserves, provided they are not earmarked for other projects. The Welsh Government said it recognised the funding pressures placed on local authorities. A spokesman added: ""We have made Â£110m available immediately to help local authorities with additional costs and brought forward Â£526m of revenue support grant payments from May and June to support them. ""We will publish a supplementary budget next week, which will include up to Â£78m of further funding for local authorities."" A HM Treasury spokesman said the UK government announced Â£3.2bn of additional funding for all local authorities to ""respond to pressures across all their services as a result of Covid-19"". Lost income: Â£400,000 per month. Reserves: It may have to use reserves if expenditure exceeds the level it budgeted for. Spending: In March it received Â£52,000 to cover costs related to Covid-19. Its claim for April will be higher. Background: More people have applied for the council tax reduction scheme since the outbreak, and the council expects to have to write off more council tax debt than normal because of the pandemic. More homes on Anglesey are applying for council tax relief It is too early to judge the full economic impact of the pandemic as the lockdown measures remain largely in place. The council is in discussions with the Welsh Government about the financial challenges presented by the pandemic. Lost income: Â£4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£5m as a direct result of the pandemic. Reserves: May need to draw on reserves if financial pressures grow such as increase in applications for council tax support and current efforts to establish 'Test, Trace and Protect' services. Background: No staff furloughed. Medium-term effects could place more pressure on the council and these may not be funded by Welsh Government. Lost income: Â£3.2m since April. Additional spending: Â£4.5m since April on social care, the provision of PPE, community hubs for childcare and free school meals. Reserves: The use of them is under review in light of the pandemic. Background: The majority of the council's services are still being offered although some have been scaled back. No staff furloughed yet. Lost income: Â£11m by end of June. Additional spending: More than Â£18m by end of June as a direct result of Covid-19. Background: Further costs will come from work to establish 'Contact Track and Trace'. It has seen a significant increase in the number of applications for the council tax reduction scheme and is concerned about the ongoing recovery of costs as current funding arrangements are confirmed only until the end of June. Cardiff is projected to spend an extra Â£18m by the end of June No information provided. Lost income: Â£1.1m by the end of June Reserves: ""Sufficient reserves"" to cover any deficit for the immediate future. Background: No impact on debt so far. It said it was difficult to say what the financial consequences will be as it is uncertain how long the situation will last. The council was waiting to hear what support it would get from the Welsh Government. The council said it was inappropriate to provide information until it knows the level of support the Welsh Government intends to provide. It added the position will become clearer in the coming weeks. Lost income: ""Significant losses"". Additional spending: It has spent more on services such as social services. Background: The council has seen a ""sharp increase"" in applications for the council tax reduction scheme and this, as well as income loss, are two main areas of cost exposure. A former day centre in Queensferry has been used as a night shelter on an occasional basis in Flintshire since lockdown began Lost income: Expects ""dramatic"" income losses of Â£6.8m. Additional spending: Â£1.2m up to June. Background: Depending on the duration of the crisis, the council said it could see losses of up to Â£16m. It said there is ""an obvious need"" for compensation for lost income from the Welsh Government, and that expected income is ""unlikely to recover for many years possibly"". Referred to the WLGA figures, which estimated the total income loss of all Welsh councils to be Â£95m and total additional spending to be Â£101m. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Additional spending: Â£521,000 on costs relating to the pandemic. Background: It has reduced expenditure by Â£634,000 where services are not operating or are reduced, and the council has furloughed 240 staff. Funding announced by the Welsh Government falls significantly short of budgetary projections and it wants the Welsh Government to ensure councils will be able to borrow money as a last resort. Lost income: Â£4.9m. Additional spending: Â£5.2m. Reserves: It has Â£18m of general reserves which would be exhausted by next April if there was no further support. Background: ""Modest"" savings have been made through suspending services but future costs, such as the cost of keeping care homes running and contact tracing, needed to be considered. The council estimates it would lose Â£7.5m through reduced council tax payments and has already borrowed Â£20m from Public Works Loan Board to make sure it could deliver Business Grants as quickly as possible. Suspending services in the Neath Port Talbot area has allowed ""modest"" savings to be made The crisis is placing ""pressure"" on spending and income. The council said it was adjusting its financial forecasts because of the pandemic. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Spending: Â£3.8m by the end of June. Background: Recovery will be lengthy and complex. The main concern is loss of income, as current Welsh Government funding only covers additional expenditure. Reserves: Without further support its ""limited"" reserves could cover the deficit for four months. Background: The pandemic has had an ""unprecedented impact"" and Powys could have a deficit of Â£10m by the end of June, leaving the council with a ""bleak"" financial future. There is a risk the council ""may not be able to financially sustain itself"" for current financial year, while council tax receipts are down Â£600,000 from the start of the new financial year. Powys, home to part of the the Brecon Beacons National Park, could run into funding problems this financial year Spending: Â£4.5m a month on the pandemic. Background: It also had additional costs due to Storm Dennis at the start of the year. No information provided. No information provided. Lost income: Â£2.4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£2.4m of extra costs by the end of June including providing PPE, temporary homeless accommodation and free school meals vouchers. Background: ""Non-essential"" spending has been stopped but no permanent decisions have been made to reduce services. It has had additional funding but it's ""too soon to say"" whether this will be enough to cover all losses. The council said it was working with the Welsh Government and other councils.

Thousands protest in Ecuador against coronavirus cuts,"Thousands of people have taken to the streets in Ecuador to protest against the government's economic response to the coronavirus outbreak. Around 2,000 people demonstrated in the capital Quito, defying restrictions aimed at combatting the virus. Last week, the president announced measures including the closure of some state-owned companies and cuts to public sector salaries. Ecuador has been one of the worst-affected countries in South America. Around 37,000 cases have been confirmed and more than 2,000 people have died with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Protesters wearing face masks and carrying flags attended demonstrations organised by trade unions and social organisations, following cuts announced by President LenÃ­n Moreno. According to Mr Moreno, 150,000 jobs have been lost as a result of coronavirus. Protests were also held in the second city of Guayaquil, whereauthorities were last month so overwhelmed by the outbreak that hundreds of bodies remained unburied. Protests were also held in Guayaquil ""If the coronavirus doesn't kill us, the government will,"" the leader of a trade union in the city told Reuters news agency. The mayor of Quito, Jorge Yundo Machado, called for ""good sense"" on Twitter. ""Let's look for different ways to protest, but not in person,"" he said, adding that there was a ""high risk of contagion, we are in a health emergency"". Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo told reporters that an estimated 4,000 people had taken part in demonstrations nationwide, and that one policeman had been injured. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) described South America as a ""new epicentre of the disease"". Brazil, which has recorded more than 23,000 deaths, has the second-highest number of confirmed infections in the world. Ecuador's neighbour Peru, meanwhile, has more than 120,000 cases.

Hong Kong leader dismisses concerns over city's freedoms,"Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said other countries ""have no place"" interfering in the territory, as she robustly defended a controversial national security law planned by China. The law would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion. Critics say it would limit the city's freedoms. But in her weekly press conference, Ms Lam said it was a ""responsible"" move to protect the law-abiding majority. She denied that the law would curtail the rights of Hong Kongers. These rights - set out in the Basic Law which is Hong Kong's mini-constitution - have been in place since it was handed back to China in 1997 by the UK. The Basic Law guarantees certain freedoms to the territory, such as the right to protest, which do not exist on the mainland. At the weekend, there was a brief return to the protests seen last year, with police firing tear gas as thousands of people took to the streets. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests How is Hong Kong run? It is not actually a law yet but a proposal - being called a ""draft decision"" - that will be put to a vote at China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), this week. Once that vote is passed, the proposal will be fleshed out into a draft law and could be in force by the end of June. Ever since it was announced, it has faced fierce criticism internationally, but Ms Lam said other countries had ""no place in interfering with this arrangement"". No country would tolerate flawed national security legislation, she said, and Hong Kong, as part of China, was no different. This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May Opponents say the proposed law is a direct attempt to curtail the city's unique freedoms. Ms Lam repeatedly said there had been no detail yet, but that the text of China's ""draft decision"" should reassure the public. She also spoke of the ""positive response"" from the public in the past few days, saying it ""flies in the face of what those overseas politicians are saying"". The bill would target ""a handful of people"" involved in terrorism or subversion, she said, and anyone worried about it should wait for the full details to be released. Hong Kong's freedoms, vibrancy and core values ""will continue to be there"", she said, but added: ""Rights and freedoms are not absolute."" The law would enhance Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, rather than damage it, she said, calling those fears ""totally groundless"". There is also concern that the law could allow China to install its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. Ms Lam said fears that this could lead to people being arrested retroactively for taking part in protests were ""imagination"". China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Lam Cho Wai, BBC News Chinese Carrie Lam tried to assure the public that the law will only target ""small groups of illegal criminals"" -  but could offer little when pressed for details. That's also her primary line of defence. She repeatedly said the spirit of the resolution put forward by Beijing was no cause for concern and the city should wait for details of the actual law. But the leader will have a hard time convincing critics. The respected Hong Kong Bar Association has already warned that there is no assurance the new law will comply with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Sunday's protests, defying a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people, were the largest in months. Despite Ms Lam's belief that the law has had a ""positive response"", there are already calls for more protests and nobody knows how big they could get. Hong Kong saw months of increasingly violent protests last year, sparked by a bill which would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. The bill was eventually dropped but by that stage the protests had escalated to include calls for more democratic freedoms for Hong Kong. Although those protests died away, in part after pro-independence groups made significant gains in local elections, anti-mainland sentiment remains high in the territory. Under the Basic Law Hong Kong is responsible for its own internal affairs and security. It was always meant to have passed its own national security law but never could because such laws were so unpopular. So critics see this as Beijing's attempt to impose its own version on Hong Kong after a tumultuous year. US condemns Chinaâs Hong Kong security law Protesters flee tear gas during rally.

"'Over a generation' for councils to pay for virusCouncils say they have a Â£173m lockdown deficit, due to a loss of income and increased costs.Wales politics","It will take a generation for Welsh councils to pay for the coronavirus pandemic, according to the body representing them. Councils have built up a deficit of about Â£173m during lockdown, due to a loss of income and increased costs. Anthony Hunt, from the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), warned they were facing a ""recovery period of years"". The Welsh Government said it had made Â£110m available for councils. One of the concerns raised by local authorities is the spike in applications for council tax reduction, and the cost of the all-Wales ""Test, Trace and Protect"" initiative. Extra Â£23m funding 'to tackle Covid-19' in Wales Coronavirus 'costing councils Â£30m a month' Mr Hunt, the WLGA's finance spokesman, and also leader of Torfaen council, said: ""There's a risk that the legacy of the coronavirus won't just be a medical one but will be a financial one that damages our communities as well."" He added: ""I think it's far too early to talk about council tax going up, and I think that's a very undesirable outcome given the strain on people's finances thanks to this."" But Rob Jones, leader at Neath Port Talbot council, warned increases were inevitable ""to keep pace with what is going on in the world"". Community hubs for childcare have added to council costs, according to one council leader He added the potential cost of test and trace would be a ""heavy burden for financial and human resources"". All 22 Welsh local authorities have been asked how the pandemic has impacted them, and 19 responded. Some said increased costs included PPE, community hubs for childcare, free school meals, extra costs in social services, contact tracing, the Â£500 bonus for care workers, and expenditure on hospitals. The Welsh Government has so far funded additional expenditure incurred as a result of the crisis, with local authorities submitting claims on a monthly basis, as well as receiving two months' worth of its core funding in advance. Although some pointed to savings where services have been scaled back or stopped, four said loss of income - not currently covered by the Welsh Government - had been significant. This is from things including leisure centres, sports and performance venues, parking fees, moving traffic offences, rent on industrial units, licenses and trade waste. Gwynedd council said, depending on the duration of the crisis, its lost income could total between Â£5m and Â£16m. Cardiff council said there had been more than 5,000 new applications for the council tax reduction scheme since April - up 1,807 on the same period to the end of June last year, with the increase costing them about Â£33.86m. Guto Ifan, a research associate at Cardiff University think-tank Wales Governance Centre (WGC), said even before the coronavirus crisis, funding for local government was 14% below what it had been in 2010, meaning there was ""very little resilience in the system already"". He said increased demands on local authorities as a result of the crisis will be around for a ""number of years"", and that ""sustained increased investment"" would be required by both the UK and Welsh governments for a prolonged period of time. ""Relying on local governments increasing council tax might not be the answer,"" he added. ""We might have to look at using the more progressive income tax powers, for instance, that the Welsh Government now has, but those are debates to be had over the next few years."" If councils generate a deficit, they can sometimes use their reserves, provided they are not earmarked for other projects. The Welsh Government said it recognised the funding pressures placed on local authorities. A spokesman added: ""We have made Â£110m available immediately to help local authorities with additional costs and brought forward Â£526m of revenue support grant payments from May and June to support them. ""We will publish a supplementary budget next week, which will include up to Â£78m of further funding for local authorities."" A HM Treasury spokesman said the UK government announced Â£3.2bn of additional funding for all local authorities to ""respond to pressures across all their services as a result of Covid-19"". Lost income: Â£400,000 per month. Reserves: It may have to use reserves if expenditure exceeds the level it budgeted for. Spending: In March it received Â£52,000 to cover costs related to Covid-19. Its claim for April will be higher. Background: More people have applied for the council tax reduction scheme since the outbreak, and the council expects to have to write off more council tax debt than normal because of the pandemic. More homes on Anglesey are applying for council tax relief It is too early to judge the full economic impact of the pandemic as the lockdown measures remain largely in place. The council is in discussions with the Welsh Government about the financial challenges presented by the pandemic. Lost income: Â£4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£5m as a direct result of the pandemic. Reserves: May need to draw on reserves if financial pressures grow such as increase in applications for council tax support and current efforts to establish 'Test, Trace and Protect' services. Background: No staff furloughed. Medium-term effects could place more pressure on the council and these may not be funded by Welsh Government. Lost income: Â£3.2m since April. Additional spending: Â£4.5m since April on social care, the provision of PPE, community hubs for childcare and free school meals. Reserves: The use of them is under review in light of the pandemic. Background: The majority of the council's services are still being offered although some have been scaled back. No staff furloughed yet. Lost income: Â£11m by end of June. Additional spending: More than Â£18m by end of June as a direct result of Covid-19. Background: Further costs will come from work to establish 'Contact Track and Trace'. It has seen a significant increase in the number of applications for the council tax reduction scheme and is concerned about the ongoing recovery of costs as current funding arrangements are confirmed only until the end of June. Cardiff is projected to spend an extra Â£18m by the end of June No information provided. Lost income: Â£1.1m by the end of June Reserves: ""Sufficient reserves"" to cover any deficit for the immediate future. Background: No impact on debt so far. It said it was difficult to say what the financial consequences will be as it is uncertain how long the situation will last. The council was waiting to hear what support it would get from the Welsh Government. The council said it was inappropriate to provide information until it knows the level of support the Welsh Government intends to provide. It added the position will become clearer in the coming weeks. Lost income: ""Significant losses"". Additional spending: It has spent more on services such as social services. Background: The council has seen a ""sharp increase"" in applications for the council tax reduction scheme and this, as well as income loss, are two main areas of cost exposure. A former day centre in Queensferry has been used as a night shelter on an occasional basis in Flintshire since lockdown began Lost income: Expects ""dramatic"" income losses of Â£6.8m. Additional spending: Â£1.2m up to June. Background: Depending on the duration of the crisis, the council said it could see losses of up to Â£16m. It said there is ""an obvious need"" for compensation for lost income from the Welsh Government, and that expected income is ""unlikely to recover for many years possibly"". Referred to the WLGA figures, which estimated the total income loss of all Welsh councils to be Â£95m and total additional spending to be Â£101m. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Additional spending: Â£521,000 on costs relating to the pandemic. Background: It has reduced expenditure by Â£634,000 where services are not operating or are reduced, and the council has furloughed 240 staff. Funding announced by the Welsh Government falls significantly short of budgetary projections and it wants the Welsh Government to ensure councils will be able to borrow money as a last resort. Lost income: Â£4.9m. Additional spending: Â£5.2m. Reserves: It has Â£18m of general reserves which would be exhausted by next April if there was no further support. Background: ""Modest"" savings have been made through suspending services but future costs, such as the cost of keeping care homes running and contact tracing, needed to be considered. The council estimates it would lose Â£7.5m through reduced council tax payments and has already borrowed Â£20m from Public Works Loan Board to make sure it could deliver Business Grants as quickly as possible. Suspending services in the Neath Port Talbot area has allowed ""modest"" savings to be made The crisis is placing ""pressure"" on spending and income. The council said it was adjusting its financial forecasts because of the pandemic. Lost income: Â£3.5m by the end of June. Spending: Â£3.8m by the end of June. Background: Recovery will be lengthy and complex. The main concern is loss of income, as current Welsh Government funding only covers additional expenditure. Reserves: Without further support its ""limited"" reserves could cover the deficit for four months. Background: The pandemic has had an ""unprecedented impact"" and Powys could have a deficit of Â£10m by the end of June, leaving the council with a ""bleak"" financial future. There is a risk the council ""may not be able to financially sustain itself"" for current financial year, while council tax receipts are down Â£600,000 from the start of the new financial year. Powys, home to part of the the Brecon Beacons National Park, could run into funding problems this financial year Spending: Â£4.5m a month on the pandemic. Background: It also had additional costs due to Storm Dennis at the start of the year. No information provided. No information provided. Lost income: Â£2.4m by end of June. Additional spending: Â£2.4m of extra costs by the end of June including providing PPE, temporary homeless accommodation and free school meals vouchers. Background: ""Non-essential"" spending has been stopped but no permanent decisions have been made to reduce services. It has had additional funding but it's ""too soon to say"" whether this will be enough to cover all losses. The council said it was working with the Welsh Government and other councils.

These were the main
developments on Tuesday:       A tissue factory is set to close because of coronavirus. Ninety-four workers will be affected by the plans at Northwood Hygiene Products in Penygroes, Gwynedd. A company spokesman said: ""As part of the review, various alternative options were considered, but the contraction in market demand as a consequence of Covid-19, and the subsequent significant fall in current and forecasted sales volumes has led to this very difficult decision being made."" A consultation process will now begin with employees. The company said production would be absorbed, and customers would still be serviced from other Northwood sites in Telford, Oldham, Birmingham, Lancaster and Bromsgrove. The Welsh Government's science advisors have said Covid-19 cases are ""most likely"" to be decreasing. They have revised down the potential impact of rates of viral transmission. The latest analysis suggests a reproduction rate, or R, of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. Initial estimates on 8 May suggested an R of 0.8 would lead to 800 more deaths and 7,200 if R was at 1.1 for the same period. The R rate is the average number a sick person could pass the virus onto. The latest paper from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) said with R in Wales analysed as below one, ""the number of cases is most likely to be decreasing"". It said R ""has decreased in Wales since social distancing and lockdown measures were introduced"". Families found camping on Halkyn Common in Flintshire, received a visit from a police patrol. Lockdown measures in Wales allow people outside to exercise and they are advised to stay close to home. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Swansea Conservatives have backed sacking Dominic Cummings ""if he is judged to have broken the rules"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior aide defended himself on Monday after driving 260 miles from London during the coronavirus lockdown. Mr Johnson has backed Mr Cummings while the Toryâs Scotland Office minister, Douglas Ross, has resigned over the affair. According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, Swansea Conservative Group said: âIf there has been any breach by Mr Cummings this should be judged by the UK government based on the account he has given and then the appropriate action should be taken. âIf he is judged to have broken the rules then we would support him being removed from his post."" The group claimed media reports had a ""personal vendetta"" against Mr Cummings and that the same level of scrutiny had not been brought against Welsh Health Secretary Vaughan Gething, or Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock. Mr Gething was pictured sitting eating chips with his family during lockdown while Mr Kinnock was contacted on Twitter by South Wales Police after he visited his father in London on his 78th birthday. It is not just people who need to learn social distancing. Guide Dogs Cymru have shared a video on Facebook showing how dogs are being trained to observe the two metre rule. Rob Roberts says people need to move on from the row A Flintshire MP has leapt to the
defence of Dominic Cummings in the face of a public backlash over histrip to County Durham during lockdown. Delynâs Conservative representative
Rob Roberts said the senior aideâs explanation of why he drove 260 miles
to his parentâs home was âreasonable and consistentâ and claimed his
brainpower was needed to tackle the pandemic. His comments were made at the same
time as several of his Tory colleagues backed calls for Mr Cummings to resign. The leader of the Conservative group
on Flintshire Council also said he sympathised with Scotland Office minister
Douglas Ross whostood down over the issue. However, Mr Roberts has now called for
people to move on from the row. âMr Cummings reports to the prime minister. If
his boss is satisfied with his explanation of events, I am inclined to move on
and get back to business,"" he said. âWe are still in the middle of a
national public health crisis. The focus now should return to that, without
this distraction."" Rob Roberts beat Labourâs David Hanson in December's General Election Friars Walk shopping centre is getting ready to reopen once lockdown rules are relaxed. Centre managers Cresco say they are waiting for âconfirmation from the Welsh Government that we are able to do soâ. Managing director Simon Pullen said measures would be put in place focusing on peopleâs health and wellbeing. He said: âThis will include a one-way system in the mall, floor vinyls to encourage people to keep their distance, and regular sanitising of key touch points such as lift buttons, car park machines and door handles.â   Police in Gwent dealt with numerous traffic offences, sending visitors to the area home, as well as shutting down house parties over the
bank holiday weekend. Gwent Police stopped 417 vehicles as part of ongoing checks
and seized âa number of vehiclesâ as a result. Speeding tickets were issued and there were arrests for driving
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. âWe are aware that we had a number of visitors who travelled
to the force area, and 52 people were advised to return home on Saturday alone,â
the police spokesperson added. âOur officers saw a number of motorcyclists turning around
immediately after seeing our presence on the roads. âWhile it is encouraging to see that the message is getting
across to people, we would like to re-emphasise the message of the Welsh
Government and the first minister: please visit Wales later. Now is not the
time.â Ynysangharad War Memorial Park in Pontypridd will reopen to the public on Wednesday, Rhondda Cynon Taf council has announced. There will be regular patrols by council officers to ensure social distancing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts MP, together with other opposition leaders, said his removal was the only way to âreturn clarity and trust in public health messaging.â The letter followed revelations Mr Cummings drove 260 miles in March from his London home to his parents' farm with his child and ill wife. It has been signed by Westminster leaders of Plaid Cymru, the SNP, Greens and Alliance, the Liberal Democrats and SDLP. The letter has been copied to Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) chairman, Sir Patrick Vallance. Ms Roberts said:

Twelve new emergency childcare hubs are being set up in Rhondda Cynon Taf schools for vulnerable youngsters and children of key workers. The new services will open on 1 June, taking the total in the county to 25. The councilâs education director, Gaynor Davies, told a virtual cabinet meeting on Thursday that the number of key worker children and vulnerable children using the hubs had risen. TheLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid as many as 420 attended the current 13 in one week this month and 130 of those were vulnerable learners. Ms Davies said: âWe continue to work with social services to identify the most vulnerable and support families and carers to apply online to access one of the 13 childcare settings."" The council's Plaid Cymru group leader, Pauline Jarman, raised concerns some vulnerable children in Mountain Ash ward were not being offered a place. The RNLI has been criticised for not having lifeguards on beaches after two people died in England on bank holiday Monday. A teenage girl trapped beneath acapsized boat and a man pulled from the seadied in separate incidents in Cornwall. A councillor has urged lifeguards to ""get back to the beaches as quickly as possible"" to help save lives. The RNLI said it was doing what it could to get its service up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic. It is working with local authorities with the hope that it can provide a lifeguard service on about 30% of the UK beaches it usually covers this summer. The Welsh Government has once again stressed to people in Wales they should avoid non-essential travel.

The Funky Monkey children's clothing shop in Penarth A businessman who owns a childrenâs clothing shop in
Wales and another in England has called for clarity from the Welsh Government
over when he can reopen. Justin Horton opened Funky Monkey in Penarth five years
ago, and bought Chickadee in Cirencester last October. Yesterday, the prime minister said non-essential
retailers could open in England on 15 June. Mr Horton said that clarity allows him to plan for the
new safety measures, train his staff and start making money again, which he cannot do with his shop in Wales. He estimates the businesses have lost âtens of thousands
of poundsâ since lockdown. Local Democracy Reporting Service A Welsh councilâs
Conservative group leader has said there are âmore important issuesâ than
Dominic Cummingsâ trip to Durham during lockdown â but his fellow Tory councillors have
voiced different opinions on the issue. The prime ministerâs
chief adviser has said he does not regret the 260-mile journey from London and
that he had acted reasonably. But critics say the trip
broke lockdown rules and have called for him to resign. Newport councilâs Tory
group leader, Councillor Matthew Evans, refused to be drawn on whether or not he
backed Mr Cummings, adding he is âsick and tired of the whole thingâ. âI have not defended
him and I have not criticised him,â he said. âPeople locally have
bigger concerns about their jobs and prospects and when they will be able to
see their friends and family again.â But Caerleon councillor
Joan Watkins said Mr Cummings was right to put family first. âHe is a father first
and stand in that manâs shoes before you make judgements,â she said. Allt-yr-yn councillor
Charles Ferris also backed Mr Cummings, saying he had given âa plausible
explanationâ about the trip. But he conceded that
the issue does risk undermining the UK governmentâs lockdown rules. âIt does tend to
undermine what we do,â he said. âBut he wanted to
protect his kids first and I think his instincts overrode that.â Graig councillor David
Williams conceded that on reflection Mr Cummings might not have made âthe best
of decisionsâ â but he added that, as a parent, he âmight have done the same thing"". Dominic Cummings has said he behaved reasonably despite criticism of his trip to Durham The deaths of eight more people in Wales have been reported, taking the total to 1,282, Public Health Wales (PHW) has said. PHW publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals and only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories. Â© 2025 BBC.

In his first answer during the daily briefing, Matt Hancock heard Martin from Brighton ask whether the government will review all penalty fines for families travelling for childcare purposes during lockdown. Hancock said it was âperfectly reasonable to take away that questionâ and said he would look at it with his Treasury colleagues. The question comes a day after the PM's chief aide said he travelled to Durham for childcare reasons - but he is accused of breaking lockdown rules and is facing calls to resign. However, it looks like all he may have been willing to do is pass the query on. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Public transport will be ""nothing like full blast"" when lockdown measures on movement ease, says BBC Scotland's transport correspondent David Henderson. ""I was at the First Bus depot in Glasgow today and they have worked out that they can only carry 18 passengers on a double decker that has seats for 75,"" he explains. ""It will only be nine or 10 on a single decker. ""Seats will be clearly marked, so you won't be allowed to sit just anywhere, and drivers will count people on and off. ""When the bus is full, the sign will come up saying 'sorry, bus full' on the destination screen. ""Those strict rules are going to apply to every bus in Scotland and trains are going to be in the same situation."" Read more:Bus and train passengers 'expected' to wear face coverings Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has been pressed on a ""major outbreak"" of coronavirus inside a Glasgow hospital. Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon called for action as she questioned Ms Freeman about ""worrying reports"" from Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow. She shared the story of patient David Holgate who was admitted to the hospital, tested negative for Covid-19, but was later struck down by the virus and died in the hospital alone. Ms Lennon said health board papers ""confirm over 20 ward closures occurred across March and April this year"" in the area because of coronavirus. The Health Secretary said she did ""not have the exact number in terms of the number of wards that were closed across all hospital settings"" - but said she would ""secure that number"". She also expressed her sympathies to those who had lost loved ones but said that the 14-day incubation period for Covid-19 meant it was very difficult to tell if someone was clear of the disease or not when they were admitted to hospital. Hearts owner Ann Budge is hoping her club will be included in an extended top flight next season The SPFL board will meet tomorrow to discuss a league reconstruction proposal put forward by Hearts owner Ann Budge. Hearts, relegated when the Scottish Premiership was called last week due to the coronavirus crisis, are expected to circulate their plan to clubs on Wednesday morning. Budge can either seek SPFL board support or enlist two other clubs to requisition an EGM. After original talks failed, Budge is proposing a temporary revamp with an expanded top tier including her club. Read more Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

JK Rowling has surprised fans with the announcement of a brand new children's book, which she is publishing in daily instalments on her website for free. The Ickabog is her first children's story not to be linked to Harry Potter. She wrote it over a decade ago for her own children and has now dusted it off. It's for ""children on lockdown, or even those back at school during these strange, unsettling times"", she said. She had previously referred to it only as an unnamed ""political fairytale"". Read more here. Education Secretary John Swinney Children will be at school part time ""as long as required but not a moment longer"", according to the Education Secretary John Swinney. Because of social distancing, it's expected that pupils will initially be at school some of the time - and working from home at other times. Pupils across Scotland are expected to return to school from August 11. Mr Swinney said he took the view the date was set in stone as long as it was safe. He told MSPs school closures had a negative effect on all aspects of children and young peopleâs progress and development, as well as their wellbeing. In response to a question from the Scottish Conservatives, Mr Swinney didn't explicitly rule out the possibility next year's exams could be cancelled. Citinga YouGov poll conducted today,external, a journalist from the Financial Times says 71% of the public believed Mr Cummings's drive to Durham broke the lockdown rules. He asks whether all those people misunderstood the rules. Matt Hancock doesn't answer the question directly but says: ""The guidelines were drafted with exceptional circumstances in mind."" If you have adults that are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance, he says. ""It is reasonable to conclude that the description of events that Mr Cummings put out yesterday was within the guidelines."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock LBC asks about an apparent loss in people's confidence in the government and its public health message over the Dominic Cummings row. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he ""of course"" understands the anger that some people feel. But he says: ""Mr Cummings himself said he should have got the facts out earlier"". And he says it is ""important"" as a country ""we focus on what we need to do now"". Hancock adds that he thinks it reasonable that some people disagree with his view. This video can not be played Jackson Carlaw on Dominic Cummings' road trip to Durham The leader of the Scottish Conservatives has told Downing Street that Dominic Cummings should consider his position. Jackson Carlaw suggested the story was ""becoming a distraction"" from efforts to fight coronavirus. Asked why he had not expressed his views earlier, he said he was waiting for the full facts and had been confident initially that Boris Johnson - who did have the facts - had made the right call. At the UK government briefing BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks about the Dominic Cummings row - did Hancock stand by his past comments that the virus stay-at-home guidelines were instructions? Hancock says Dominic Cummings set out what happened in ""extensive detail"" yesterday. He says she can understand why ""reasonable people"" have a different view, but his view is the same as the PM's and he believes Dominic Cummings' actions were reasonable. ""If you are unable to look after a small child that is an exceptional circumstance,"" he says. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Douglas Ross shares a dram with Boris Johnson in November Douglas Ross tells BBC Scotland: ""As a minister, you must be able to defend what the government are saying and I wasn't able to do that. ""I was feeding in over the weekend that my constituents were unhappy - and some are unhappy with my resignation - but I had a choice to make. I'm the MP for Moray and I thought the best way to represent my home area was to resign from government but to continue to stand up for this area from the backbenches. ""I have constituents who followed the guidance, they didn't go to hospital to support a loved one, they didn't go to a funeral to mourn."" Mr Ross says he thinks Mr Cummings might have behaved differently with the benefit of hindsight and explains that he has discussed a self-isolation plan at home with his wife and child. He adds that there are still ""unanswered questions"" from Mr Cummings' statement, which is why he couldn't defend it and says the issue is a distraction from the good economic response to the current crisis.

She has written to Scottish Secretary Alister Jack voice support for Douglas Ross' resignation. The former Labour MSP said Cummings' excuse was not ""reasonable"" and ""he should have known better than anyone what the advice was"". Former MSP and current leader of Dumfries and Galloway Council Elaine Murray lost her mother to Covid-19 Dr Murray told BBC Radio Scotland: ""My mother was in a care home, she was suffering from advanced dementia. On 20 April I was advised that she'd have a stroke and that she probably didn't have very long to live. ""I was lucky because the care home allowed me in to visit her two days consecutively, but I wasn't there when she died. ""My sister, who's in London, her instinct - as we were saying about Cummings - would have been to get on a train and come up to try and see her. She didn't do it. She was unable to attend the funeral because she lived in London and she wasn't going to take the risk of travelling by public transport and changing at Carlisle to come up to Dumfries.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock The UK government briefing is underway. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is likely to face questions about whether the prime minister's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules when he drove from London to Durham with his sick wife.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Douglas Ross, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, said today that he was quitting after hearing Dominic Cummingsâ efforts to defend his trip from London to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. Moray MP told BBC Scotland that he ""could understand the instant decision to protect his son and wife"" but could not justify Mr Cummings' actions to his constituents since others would not have been able to act in a similar way if they were following the government guidance. Mr Ross also adds that he ""can't reason"" with Cummings' explanation for his drive to test his eyesight.

"Thousands protest in Ecuador against coronavirus cutsThe president announced the closure of seven state-owned companies last week, leading to job cuts.","Thousands of people have taken to the streets in Ecuador to protest against the government's economic response to the coronavirus outbreak. Around 2,000 people demonstrated in the capital Quito, defying restrictions aimed at combatting the virus. Last week, the president announced measures including the closure of some state-owned companies and cuts to public sector salaries. Ecuador has been one of the worst-affected countries in South America. Around 37,000 cases have been confirmed and more than 2,000 people have died with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Protesters wearing face masks and carrying flags attended demonstrations organised by trade unions and social organisations, following cuts announced by President LenÃ­n Moreno. According to Mr Moreno, 150,000 jobs have been lost as a result of coronavirus. Protests were also held in the second city of Guayaquil, whereauthorities were last month so overwhelmed by the outbreak that hundreds of bodies remained unburied. Protests were also held in Guayaquil ""If the coronavirus doesn't kill us, the government will,"" the leader of a trade union in the city told Reuters news agency. The mayor of Quito, Jorge Yundo Machado, called for ""good sense"" on Twitter. ""Let's look for different ways to protest, but not in person,"" he said, adding that there was a ""high risk of contagion, we are in a health emergency"". Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo told reporters that an estimated 4,000 people had taken part in demonstrations nationwide, and that one policeman had been injured. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) described South America as a ""new epicentre of the disease"". Brazil, which has recorded more than 23,000 deaths, has the second-highest number of confirmed infections in the world. Ecuador's neighbour Peru, meanwhile, has more than 120,000 cases.

Government to try to move focus away from Cummings,"People will make up their own minds after listening to Dominic Cummings' ""exhaustive"" account of his travels during the lockdown, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. The prime minister's chief aidehas defended driving 260 milesin March from his home to County Durham. He said he acted reasonably and legally in going to stay on his parents' farm. His statement on Monday overshadowedthe PM's new plans to reopen all non-essential shops in England on 15 June. Boris Johnson said shops will be able to open if they meet safety guidelines. They follow outdoor markets and car showrooms, which will be allowed to reopen from 1 June. Retailers have generally welcomed the announcement but some experts said more clarity was needed onhow shops should keep staff and customers safe. Cummings' show did not answer fundamental question 'I don't regret what I did' - Cummings Timeline: What did Cummings do? Mr Cummings has faced calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife from London to County Durham during lockdown. At his news conference in the garden of 10 Downing Street on Monday afternoon, he saidhe did not regret his actions. On the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed symptoms - Mr Cummings said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to London. He explained that he had experienced some eyesight problems during his illness. Following the conference, several government ministers rallied in support of Mr Cummings, with many writing on Twitter that it was ""time to move on"". This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row Mr Gove said Mr Cummings' account of his actions was ""exhaustive, detailed and verifiable"". ""People will make their own mind up as they listened to Dominic's account,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Most people will understand he was under pressure, and sought to put the health of his wife and son first, and took care to ensure they as a family unit were not in danger of infecting other people."" Opposition MPs are due to meet later to discuss how to hold Boris Johnson and his senior aide to account. Labour has criticised Mr Cummings for failing to apologise for his actions, while other parties continue to call for him to be sacked. Dominic Cummings' rose garden confessional was a bold move designed to take the drama out of a crisis. But giving detailed answers to why he at the very least broke the spirit of the lockdown rules does not answer the fundamental question now - is his continued presence in Downing Street more of a hindrance than a help to Boris Johnson? Tempers may have cooled slightly on the Conservative backbenches, but there are still calls for him to go, both private and public. And some senior Conservative MPs are still aghast at how much political capital the prime minister has burned through to keep Mr Cummings at his side. Opposition leaders still intend to push for his departure. The man respected by Mr Johnson for judging the public mood has made himself famous for falling foul of that opinion. His explanations may ease for some of the anger. But in Westminster and beyond, it will not disappear overnight. And when the prime minister is interrogated by senior MPs on Wednesday his decisions over Dominic Cummings will surely be on the list. Read more from Laura. Boris Johnson said he regretted the ""confusion and anger"" caused by the row, but continued to back Mr Cummings. This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to a question about Dominic Cummings' drive to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight Meanwhile, all shops in England will be allowed to reopen from 15 June provided they meetnew social distancing and hygiene measures,externalto protect customers and staff from the virus. Mr Johnson said the change would depend on premises being ""Covid-secure"" and on the country making progress towards meetingthe five tests set out by the governmentas being crucial to lifting the lockdown restrictions. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of the retail consultancy Savvy, said some smaller retailers would want ""more clarity"" from safety guidelines, on things like how many people can be in a store at one time. She also questioned whether there would be the appetite from the public to return to shops. ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Women's Super League season brought to immediate end,"Arsenal and Chelsea, along with leaders Manchester City, were the three clubs challenging for the title when the WSL season was halted The Women's Super League and Women's Championship seasons have been ended immediately, with the outcome of the WSL title and promotion and relegation issues still to be decided. The joint WSL and Women's Championship board has sent various recommendations to the Football Association board to ""determine the most appropriate sporting outcome for the season"". An FA statement said the decision came after ""overwhelming feedback from clubs"" and was made ""in the best interest of the women's game"". It continued: ""This will also enable clubs, the Women's Super League and Women's Championship board and the FA to plan, prepare and focus on next season when football returns for the 2020-21 campaign."" It means all divisions of women's football in England have now been cancelled for the 2019-20 campaign. Clubs had been assuming their season would not resume, several sources had told BBC Sport, leaving the 45 remaining fixtures in the WSL - and 36 in the Championship - outstanding. Monday's joint leagues board meeting came after a formal consultation process with clubs last week. The FA wrote to clubs on Wednesday to seek their formal views on whether to end the season and how to do so. Manchester City were top of the table when the season was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, although second-placed Chelsea had a game in hand on the leaders. Reigning champions Arsenal were three points further back in third place. Should final places in the Women's Super League be decided by an unweighted points-per-game ratio, Chelsea would climb above City to go top. Also still to be confirmed are England's two representatives to take part in next season's Women's Champions League, which, the FA said in their statement, ""would be based on sporting merit"" from the WSL season. At the foot of the WSL, Liverpool remain in danger of being relegated. The Reds are a point below second-from-bottom Birmingham and have played a game more. Aston Villa are six points clear of Sheffield United at the top of the second-tier Championship. It is understood no decision has yet been made regarding the conclusion of the Women's FA Cup, which had reached the quarter-final stage before March's suspension of elite football in England. Points-per-game is 'fairest way' to settle final WSL places - Beard Manchester Citysaid they ""now await the outcome of discussions regarding the final standings of the league table"". On their website, the club added: ""While disappointed that we are unable to complete the season, we understand the complexities of the situation and support the FA's decision. ""Our priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our players and staff, and we will now move forward with preparations for next season."" Manchester City took 40 points from their 16 matches in this season's Women's Super League Liverpoolsaid they believed they ""would have been able to meet the operational and financial obligations associated with a return to play, once detailed drafts and accurate protocols had been shared with clubs"", However, the club said they now ""await an equitable solution to those issues still to be decided in a campaign where a third of our league games were still to be played"". Manchester Unitedwere fourth in their first season at WSL level, and said they ""understood"" and ""accepted"" the decision to bring the campaign to an early conclusion. United manager Casey Stoney said: ""It's obviously disappointing not to be able complete the season, but it is the right decision for the safety of everyone involved. ""Our focus now moves to our development for next season, which we have been continuously planning for throughout the year, and we can't wait to be back on the pitch again when it is safe to do so."" West Ham Unitedboss Matt Beard said: ""While the preference was always to return to the pitch to determine the campaign if safe to do so, we completely understand the unique situation that we, and football, finds itself in. ""As always, the health and safety of our players, staff and fantastic supporters remains the priority at all times."" Bristol Citymanager Tanya Oxtoby added: ""The safety of the players, staff and public is the most important thing and, while it's disappointing that we cannot finish our eight remaining games, we appreciate that a decision has now been made."" Crystal Palace,who were eighth in the 11-team Championship, posted on Twitter: ""Obviously a disappointing end to the season but the safety of our players and staff is paramount.
