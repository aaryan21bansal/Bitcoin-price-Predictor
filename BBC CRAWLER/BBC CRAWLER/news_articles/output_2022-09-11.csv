All-night queues expected for Queen's lying-in-stateDetails of how people can pay their final respects at the Palace of Westminster have been revealed.UK,"There were huge queues along the banks of the River Thames, where people waited to pay their respects to the Queen. People were told not to set off to see the lying-in-state on Sunday, as the queue reached full capacity. Just after 22:40, the queue was closed to new entrants. At 06:30 BST on Monday the lying-in-state ended. Here's what else you need you to know about the queue. At its longest, the wait time was more than 24 hours. The queue's maximum length was 10 miles - with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark, and a three-mile zigzag queue in Southwark Park.

YouTube: DCMS,external Twitter: DCMS,external Facebook: DCMS,external People were warned they would need to stand for many hours with little opportunity to sit down, as the queue is constantly moving. On Sunday morning, thegovernment tracker,externaladvised people not to set off to join the queue as the entry point might soon close. The queue finally closed late on Sunday evening. People in the queue received coloured wristbands so they could leave for a drink, or go to the toilet, and then return. Those in the queue were asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Watch live: The Queen's lying-in-state What is lying in state? As people passed through Albert Embankment they were directed across Lambeth Bridge, into Victoria Tower Gardens, towards Parliament. They went through airport-style security before entering Westminster Hall, inside the Palace of Westminster. There were more than 500 portable toilets at various points along the route. Local venues and museums - including the Southbank Centre, the National Theatre, BFI Southbank and Shakespeare's Globe - stayed open for extended hours and in some cases for 24 hours, for people to use their facilities.

Princess Diana's title changed after her divorce from King Charles, and she became Diana, Princess of Wales The princess has become the first since Princess Diana to use the well-known title, one that was also previously Camilla's but which she never used. Catherine described Diana as ""an inspirational woman to look up to"" following her engagement to Prince William in 2010. The royal couple will also take the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall titles, previously held by the King and Camilla, the new Queen Consort. King Charles was crowned Prince of Wales in front of huge crowds at at Caernarfon Castle The King was only 20 years old when he was crowned Prince of Wales in a ceremony at Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, in 1969. The investiture was watched by a TV audience of millions around the world - however it is a title that has divided opinion in Wales. An opinion poll of 1,020 people in June 2022, conducted by ITV and YouGov, suggested that 46% of people thought there should be another Prince of Wales, while 31% did not.

LiveLive100-year-old 'thrilled' to receive royal message - your tributes to the Queen19 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

On the front line of the battle for Kharkiv,"Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday. In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report. We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine. He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions."" We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people."" Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around. From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops."" The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website. It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says. The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone. This video can not be played Watch: Our correspondent on the front line, with Ukraineâs troops - this report contains graphic images of casualties Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win."" Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops. I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht. Battalion commander Sergey But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone. I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard. Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team ""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike. What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"". At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since. Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running. Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks. This video can not be played Watch: How Russia is using tactics refined over a decade in Syria He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home. The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station. Dmitry in intensive care In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae. It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing. This video can not be played Watch: Doctors removed a bullet from between Dmitriy's skull and vertebrae Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night. Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers. All of the city is now a front line. And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance. But still Ukraine resists. I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire. Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold. The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies. ""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug. And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still. Are you or your family in Ukraine?

Ukrainian army says it has tripled retaken area,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian military enter key city of Kupiansk Ukraine's military says its forces have retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) during a rapid counter-offensive in eastern Ukraine. The remarkable advance, if confirmed, means Kyiv's forces have tripled their stated gains in little over 48 hours. President Zelensky put the figure at 1,000 sq km on Thursday evening, and then 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening. The BBC cannot verify the Ukrainian figures, and journalists have been denied access to the frontlines. On Saturday, the eastern counter-attack saw Ukrainian troops enter the vital Russian-held supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk. But UK defence officials have warned thatfighting has continued,externaloutside those towns. And officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian forces were still fighting to gain control of a number of settlements around Izyum. Russia's defence ministry confirmed its forces' retreat from Izyum itself and Kupiansk, which it said would allow them""to regroup"" in territory held by Moscow-backed separatists. The Russian ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia, in order to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. Ukrainian forces entered the town on Friday. The pace of the counter-attack has caught the Russians off guard, and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov - a staunch supporter of President Vladimir Putin - appeared to question Moscow's military strategy. In a message posted to Telegram, Mr Kadyrov said if there was not a change in Russia's fortunes, he would be forced to question the country's leadership to explain the situation. Meanwhile President Volodomyr Zelensky accused Russia of targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine's east in response - leaving large swathes of territory in ""total blackout."" Power was cut off completely throughout the entire Kharkiv and Donetsk regions depriving people of ""light and heat"", Ukraine's leaderclaimed on Twitter,external. Outages were also reported in several other areas near the frontline on Sunday. Shock and joy in Ukraine's liberated villages On Saturday, the head of the Russia-installed administration in the Kharkiv region recommended that its people evacuate to Russia ""to save lives"". Unverified footage on social media appeared to show long queues of traffic building up at border crossings. The governor of the Belgorod border region in Russia, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said ""thousands"" of people had crossed into the country. Meanwhile, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander of Ukraine's military, said his forces had advanced to within 50km (31 miles) of the Russian border. But Russians still hold around a fifth of the country, and few imagine a swift end to the war. In an interview with the Financial Times, Ukraine's defence minister Oleksii Reznikov hailed his troops, but warned of the potential for a Russian counter-attack. ""A counter-offensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it,"" Mr Reznikov said. ""Of course, we have to be worried, this war has worried us for years."" The Ukrainian advances - if held - would be the most significant frontline changes since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. Kupiansk served as Russia's main eastern supply hub and the loss of Izyum - which Moscow spent over a month trying to take at the beginning of the war - would be seen as a major humiliation for President Vladimir Putin. According to one military expert, the advance marks the first time since World War Two that whole Russian units have been lost. The gains will also be seen as a sign that Ukraine's army has the capacity to retake occupied territory - crucial as Kyiv continues to ask hard-pressed Western allies for military support. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest developments showed its forces could end the war faster with more Western weapons. Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in the east earlier this week, while international attention was focused on an anticipated advance near the southern city of Kherson. Analysts believe Russia redirected some of its most seasoned troops to defend the city. In addition to gaining ground in the east, Ukraine is also making gains in the south, an official said. Nataliya Gumenyuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army's southern command, said they had advanced ""between two and several dozens of kilometres"" along that front. But Russian forces fighting on the southern front are said to have dug into defensive positions, and Ukraine's troops have faced heavy resistance since the offensive began. And in Kharkiv itself, one person was killed and several homes damaged on Saturday as Russian rocket fire hit the city, according to local officials. Elsewhere, Ukraine's energy regulator, Energoatom, says the last reactor at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been shut down, and is not generating electricity. The reactor had been generating energy for the plant itself for three days - it was shut down when external power was restored. The Ukrainian operator said that to prevent an emergency, it was essential that shelling of the power lines connecting the station to the national grid be halted.

Blackouts in Ukraine blamed on Russian attacks,"This video can not be played Watch: Firefighters battle flames after missile strike on power station Russia aims to ""deprive people of light and heat"" by causing power cuts across eastern Ukraine in revenge for a Ukrainian counter-offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Blackouts reportedly affected millions of people in the eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The Kharkiv city mayor says power is now restored. It comes after Ukraine said it had retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) in an eastern counter-offensive. The BBC cannot verify these figures. Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure left much of his city without power or water on Sunday evening. He called it a vile and cynical attempt at revenge for the Ukrainian army's recent successes. What sounded like two further missile strikes were heard later in the evening, the BBC's international correspondent Orla Guerin reported from Kharkiv. Mr Terekhov and the region's governor called for calm, saying the emergency services were working to repair damage and put out fires. The governor of the neighbouring Sumy region said over 130 settlements in one district alone were without power. Similar problems have been reported in Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava regions. In a defiant post on social media after the power cuts, President Zelensky accused Russia of carrying out ""terrorist acts"" by targeting civilian infrastructure. ""Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst are not as terrible and deadly for us as your 'friendship and brotherhood',"" he wrote on Telegram. It comes after a remarkable Ukrainian advance, which if confirmed will mean Ukrainian forces have tripled their territorial gains in little over 48 hours. President Zelensky said 1,000 sq km had been retaken on Thursday evening. That figure rose to 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening, then to 3,000 on Sunday. UK defence officials estimated thatUkraine had recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London,external- more than 3,000 sq km - in the Kharkiv region since Wednesday. They added that Ukrainian army's successes would have ""significant implications"" for Russia's overall operational design. Journalists have been denied access to the front lines but several videos on social media show Ukrainian troops present in towns and villages that were until recently held by Russia. Ukrainian forces entered the key town of Balaklyia on Friday. Russia later confirmed the withdrawal of troops, to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. The vital Russian-held supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk were taken by Ukraine on Saturday. Russia confirmed its forces' retreat from both towns, which it said would allow them to ""regroup"". Valerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, said residents should be able to return to the town in about 10 days for the first time since it was captured by Russia in March. Two-thirds of the population had fled, he told Newshour on the BBC World Service, but most wanted to go back despite extensive destruction and a lack of energy, water or communications. Izyum was probably the biggest logistical hub for the Russian army, he said, as it was a gateway to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the Donbas region, where Russia wanted to advance. But Russia still holds around a fifth of the country, and few imagine a swift end to the war. In an interview with the Financial Times, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned of the potential for a Russian counter-attack. ""A counter-offensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it,"" Mr Reznikov said.

Scotland prepares to say farewell to the Queen,"This video can not be played Watch: King Charles III leads the procession behind the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh Thousands of people watched in near-silence as the Queen's coffin made its journey up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Queen's children, led by King Charles III, walked behind the hearse as it drove from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral. A service of remembrance was then held in the cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest until Tuesday afternoon. It is estimated that20,000 people are in a mile-long queueto pay their last respects. All four of the Queen's children - King Charles, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward - later held a vigil for 10 minutes around the coffin of their late mother at the cathedral. 'I had to come and pay my last respects' The people queuing to see the Queen's coffin What to know ahead of viewing the Queen's coffin In pictures: King Charles in Scotland and Westminster Hall Earlier they had walked behind the hearse, along with Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. A car behind them carried Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife. Meanwhile, many people have spent hours queuing through the night to file past the coffin, ahead of its journey to London. By BBC Scotland's Andrew Picken, on the Royal Mile As the procession edged closer the crowd fell silent and cries of ""she's here"" were heard. There was a sea of hands holding phones in the air to try and capture the moment on camera while a barking dog momentarily put the police horses on edge. From the back of the crowd a cry of ""God Save the King"" came as the coffin passed the Canons' Gait pub. The silence lingered for a few moments after the procession had passed as people collected their thoughts. There was a respectful silence from the crowd earlier, which was 10 deep in places, as the procession to the cathedral took place on Monday afternoon. The quiet was punctuated by the echo of ceremonial gunshots which were fired from Edinburgh Castle every minute. Police Scotland said a 22 year-old man had been arrested in connection with a breach of the peace after footage appeared to show a man heckling the royal procession on the Royal Mile. The King hadaddressed both Houses of Parliamentearlier on Monday, before he and the Queen Consort flew to Edinburgh. He was welcomed on the tarmac by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Robert Aldridge. They then travelled to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where there was applause as the King and the Queen Consort met members of the public. The monarch spent time shaking hands and also received gifts of flowers. King Charles took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys King Charles inspects an honour guard at the Palace of Holyroodhouse King Charles then took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys, where he was handed the keys to the city by the lord provost. In keeping with tradition, he handed them back, entrusting their safekeeping to the city's elected officials. King Charles III also inspected a guard of honour from the Royal Regiment of Scotland. He then led the procession to St Giles' Cathedral behind the Queen's coffin, which was draped with the Royal Standard in Scotland and dressed with a wreath of flowers. The cathedral then hosted a service celebrating the Queen's life and her connection to Scotland. This video can not be played Watch: Royal Regiment of Scotland place Queen's coffin on the catafalque The Rev Calum MacLeod, who led the service, welcomed the Royal family, representatives of ""our nation's life"" and ""people whose lives were touched by the Queen in so many unforgettable ways"". He said: ""We gather to bid Scotland's farewell to our late monarch, whose life of service to the nation and the world we celebrate. And whose love for Scotland was legendary."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon read a lesson during the service, which was also attended by Prime Minister Liz Truss. Later, Ms Sturgeon - who had an audience with King Charles at Holyrood - paid tribute to the Queen during a motion of condolence in the Scottish Parliament. She hailed the Queen as ""a true and steadfast friend of this parliament"" who has been ""intrinsic to the story of modern Scotland"". King Charles responded to the motion in the Scottish Parliament Responding to the motion, King Charles said: ""Through all the years of her reign, the Queen, like so many generations of our family before her, found in the hills of this land and in the hearts of its people a haven and a home."" Paraphrasing Robert Burns, he described the Queen as: ""The friend of man, the friend of truth, the friend of age and guide of youth. ""Few hearts like hers with virtue warmed, few heads with knowledge so informed."" The monarch also confirmed he was passing his Duke of Rothesay title to Prince William. Mourners then started filing past the Queen's coffin at St Giles' Cathedral, includingwhile the King and his siblings' stood in vigil on Monday evening. The symbolic ceremony sees four people - in this case King Charles III, Princess Anne and Princes Andrew and Edward - position themselves at each side of the coffin to stand guard for a short time. The Princess Royal's appearance has made her the first woman to be part of the vigil, which has until now been carried out by male-only members of the Royal Family. While the Queen lies at rest at St Giles' Cathedral, her coffin will remain under continuous vigil for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers. The queue to view the coffin starts at George Square Lane/North Meadow Walk in The Meadows, where wristbands are being issued for entry to the cathedral. The public have been warned the queue is likely to involve standing for a number of hours. Members of the public filed past while the King and his three siblings posted a vigil around the coffin Mourners were advised to bring their own food and drinks. Toilets are available and visitors are able to leave the queue briefly to use the facilities. There are be airport-style security checks for entering St Giles' at George IV Bridge and certain restrictions apply on mobile phones, with photography and recording not permitted.

"How ex-PMs valued Queen's advice and experienceGordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May share memories of the Queen with Laura Kuenssberg.","There is a tiny special club, a powerful group who knew Queen Elizabeth in a particular and private way - her prime ministers. They all used to speak to her in person for an hour or so each week. The monarch was their confidant of sorts, an adviser providing a shrewd ear. For this week's programme I've been speaking to Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, the Queen's 11th, 12th, and 13th prime ministers, about why it matters, their memories of one monarch, and their hopes for the next. The Queen always would have ""done her red boxes, read government papers"" and would be well-versed in the dilemmas of government decisions, said Mrs May. Her predecessor, Mr Brown, joked that sometimes he had been ""embarrassed"" by the extent of her knowledge, recalling that on one occasion she had more up to date information about a particular Commonwealth country than he did. Mr Cameron described the Queen as the ""world's greatest public servant"" with a profound understanding of what was going on at any one moment. This video can not be played Watch: Mr Cameron told the BBC that Charles had served âthe longest apprenticeship in historyâ All three former PMs told me they benefitted enormously from her long years of experience that she shared with them in private - a sense that whatever the problem of the day, she could provide advice and a sense of proportion. They all emphasised the new King's long years of preparation and knowledge of the role he now occupies, with Mr Cameron telling me the then-Prince Charles, during what he called ""the longest apprenticeship in history"", had practised holding audiences with him while his mother was on the throne. Looking to the future, Mr Brown said he felt King Charles - in his televised address to the nation on Friday - had carefully sent a message to the country that his priorities would change, leaving his charities and causes to others to take on. What happens next after the Queen's death?

For Mr Brown it was the time she told the corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons. For months after, they would defend themselves when being told off for using the phrase by saying: ""If the Queen says it, why can't we?"" Gordon Brown recalls the Queen telling her corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons Mr Cameron recalled the time he got lost on the Balmoral estate but was found by the Duke of Edinburgh - travelling at speed in his Land Rover across the moor - and how at state occasions, his wife Samantha always wanted to sit next to the then-Prince Charles because he was the most fun companion for a long, formal evening. Mrs May remembered with laughter the time she dropped the cheese at the Balmoral picnic, then put it back on the table even though the Queen was watching her every move, and how at those Highland weekends the monarch would sit happily playing patience on her own while her guests mingled around her. These politicians knew the Queen well, but our conversations echo how many members of the public perhaps felt - the most formal, yet familiar too. The monarch with golden robes and a jewel-laden Crown - but a friendly face in a difficult moment. The most experienced and knowledgeable diplomat the country has ever seen, and the party host clearing up the barbecue. The head of state of the sixth biggest economy in the world, but also a great-grandmother at ease with Paddington Bear. On our show last week we interviewed the woman who was the last politician to have the traditional audience with the Queen. It's fitting perhaps that the last formal photograph of her showed that vital encounter with Liz Truss. The new PM and the new King are now the next to fulfil this tradition. It's hard to fathom how much has changed in just seven days. But the connection, the importance of the conversations between the inhabitant of the Palace and the prime minister goes on.

LiveLive'She could reach everybody' - your tributes to the Queen14 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

Russian forces retreat as Ukraine takes key towns,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian military enter key city of Kupiansk Russian forces have withdrawn from key eastern towns, as a rapid Ukrainian counter-attack makes further gains. Ukrainian officials said troops entered Kupiansk, a vital eastern supply hub for Russian forces, on Saturday. Russia's defence ministry then said its troops have retreated from nearby Izyum to allow them ""to regroup"". The ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia, in order to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. The Ukrainian advances - if held - would be the most significant since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. In his nightly video address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukraine had now liberated 2,000 sq km (700 sq miles) from Russia since beginning a renewed counter-offensive earlier this month. His claim would suggest that half of that area has been recaptured in the last 48 hours alone - as it istwice the area of territory Mr Zelensky said had been liberated when he spoke on Thursday evening. Russia's admission of a withdrawal from Izyum is significant because it was a major military hub for Moscow. ""A three-day operation was carried out on the drawdown and organised transfer of the Izyum-Balakliya group of troops to the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic,"" the Russian statement said. ""In order to prevent damage to the Russian troops, a powerful fire defeat was inflicted on the enemy."" Shortly afterwards, the chief administrator of Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region recommended that its residents evacuate to Russia ""to save lives"", according to the Russian state-run Tass news agency. And the governor of the neighbouring Belgorod region, in Russia, said mobile catering, heating, and medical assistance would be available to people queuing to cross the border. The advances will be seen as a sign that Ukraine's army has the capacity to retake Russian-occupied territory, crucial as Kyiv continues to ask its hard-pressed Western allies for military support. Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest developments had shown its forces were able to defeat the Russian army and could end the war faster with more Western weapons. Encouragement for Kyiv and allies Analysis by Orla Guerin, Senior International Correspondent in central Ukraine The pace of the counter-offensive has not only caught the Russians off guard, but even surprised some Ukrainians. People here have been struggling to keep up with news of the latest gains. The Russians have now lost two key logistics hubs - the railway cities of Izyum and Kupiansk. This is a military setback and a public humiliation for President Putin. We cannot reach the frontlines. Journalists have been denied access. Ukraine is determined to control the information war. But plenty of footage has emerged on social media showing Ukrainian troops raising their flag in newly liberated areas. All of this is cathartic for Ukraine and reassuring for its Western backers. The Russians still hold around a fifth of the country and few imagine a swift end to the war. But the Ukrainians have now shown they can beat the Russians in battle, not just outmanoeuvre them. According to one military expert, it's the first time since World War Two that whole Russian units have been lost. Earlier, UK defence officials said Ukraine had advanced 50km (31 miles) into previously Russian-held territory. ""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said. ""The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns."" Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in the east earlier this week, while international attention was focused on an anticipated advance near the southern city of Kherson. Analysts believe Russia redirected some of its most seasoned troops to defend the city. But as well as gaining ground in the east, Ukraine is also making gains in the south, an official said. Nataliya Gumenyuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army's southern command, said they had advanced ""between two and several dozens of kilometres"" along that front. But Russian forces fighting on the southern front are said to have dug into defensive positions, and Ukraine's troops have faced heavy resistance since the offensive began. And in Kharkiv itself, one person was killed and several homes damaged on Saturday as Russian rocket fire hit the city, according to local officials. Ukrainian officials shared a picture on social media that appeared to show Ukrainian troops holding up the country's flag in front of Kupiansk city hall, with the Russian flag at their feet. On Friday President Zelensky said his forces were ""gradually taking control of new settlements"" and ""returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people"". Ukraine suggests UN peacekeepers for nuclear plant What military equipment is the world giving to Ukraine? He also said that national police units were returning to liberated settlements and urged civilians to report suspected Russian war crimes to them. His call followed a report from the UN's monitoring team in Ukraine which said they had ""documented a range of violations against prisoners of war"" by Moscow's forces. The report also accused Ukrainian troops of ""cases of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war"".

Zelensky says Ukraine has doubled its retaken area,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian military enter key city of Kupiansk Ukraine's military says its forces have retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) during a rapid counter-offensive in eastern Ukraine. The remarkable advance, if confirmed, means Kyiv's forces have tripled their stated gains in little over 48 hours. President Zelensky put the figure at 1,000 sq km on Thursday evening, and then 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening. The BBC cannot verify the Ukrainian figures, and journalists have been denied access to the frontlines. On Saturday, the eastern counter-attack saw Ukrainian troops enter the vital Russian-held supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk. But UK defence officials have warned thatfighting has continued,externaloutside those towns. And officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian forces were still fighting to gain control of a number of settlements around Izyum. Russia's defence ministry confirmed its forces' retreat from Izyum itself and Kupiansk, which it said would allow them""to regroup"" in territory held by Moscow-backed separatists. The Russian ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia, in order to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. Ukrainian forces entered the town on Friday. The pace of the counter-attack has caught the Russians off guard, and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov - a staunch supporter of President Vladimir Putin - appeared to question Moscow's military strategy. In a message posted to Telegram, Mr Kadyrov said if there was not a change in Russia's fortunes, he would be forced to question the country's leadership to explain the situation. Meanwhile President Volodomyr Zelensky accused Russia of targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine's east in response - leaving large swathes of territory in ""total blackout."" Power was cut off completely throughout the entire Kharkiv and Donetsk regions depriving people of ""light and heat"", Ukraine's leaderclaimed on Twitter,external. Outages were also reported in several other areas near the frontline on Sunday. Shock and joy in Ukraine's liberated villages On Saturday, the head of the Russia-installed administration in the Kharkiv region recommended that its people evacuate to Russia ""to save lives"". Unverified footage on social media appeared to show long queues of traffic building up at border crossings. The governor of the Belgorod border region in Russia, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said ""thousands"" of people had crossed into the country. Meanwhile, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander of Ukraine's military, said his forces had advanced to within 50km (31 miles) of the Russian border. But Russians still hold around a fifth of the country, and few imagine a swift end to the war. In an interview with the Financial Times, Ukraine's defence minister Oleksii Reznikov hailed his troops, but warned of the potential for a Russian counter-attack. ""A counter-offensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it,"" Mr Reznikov said. ""Of course, we have to be worried, this war has worried us for years."" The Ukrainian advances - if held - would be the most significant frontline changes since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. Kupiansk served as Russia's main eastern supply hub and the loss of Izyum - which Moscow spent over a month trying to take at the beginning of the war - would be seen as a major humiliation for President Vladimir Putin. According to one military expert, the advance marks the first time since World War Two that whole Russian units have been lost. The gains will also be seen as a sign that Ukraine's army has the capacity to retake occupied territory - crucial as Kyiv continues to ask hard-pressed Western allies for military support. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest developments showed its forces could end the war faster with more Western weapons.

And in Kharkiv itself, one person was killed and several homes damaged on Saturday as Russian rocket fire hit the city, according to local officials. Elsewhere, Ukraine's energy regulator, Energoatom, says the last reactor at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been shut down, and is not generating electricity. The reactor had been generating energy for the plant itself for three days - it was shut down when external power was restored. The Ukrainian operator said that to prevent an emergency, it was essential that shelling of the power lines connecting the station to the national grid be halted.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and
all other business will be suspended until after the state funeral. Amotion of condolence will express the Seneddâs ""deep sadness at the death of Her Majesty The Queen"". The Queen officially opened the Senedd building in 2006 and last
visited in 2021 to open its sixth session.

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary. This video can not be played Commonwealth countries pay tribute to the Queen Countries throughout the Commonwealth - the association of 56 nations with ties to the former British empire - have been sharing their condolences and memories of Queen Elizabeth II. From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here. Prince William, the new Prince of Wales,paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth saying his grandmother had been at his side on both his happiest and saddest days.Read what he said here. King Charlesheld audiences with ministers and met opposition politicians at Buckingham Palace. Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had
left. Dignitaries
are expected to continue to make their way to the embassy and pay their
respects. Wanita Harris-Wise was
carrying a small bunch of flowers and wanted to go and show her respects to the
monarch. âQueen Elizabeth was all we
knew growing up. Iâm 64 years of age and when you thought of the Queen thatâs
who the Queen was. We call our children princesses. We want our children to
grow up to be in that same honour in light of the Queen.â Wanita left a small bunch of flowers in memory of the Queen Eloise AlannaReporting from Ottawa, Canada Itâs been a very hot day
     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello. I remember my Mum and Dad introducing us all. She asked where we were going and took time to find out where we were from,"" he recalls. Yasmine Jamil says she ""couldn't have enough"" of stories about the Queen when she was growing up in Pakistan, and that the monarch's death felt like ""losing a dear family member"".

Windsor Castle today to pay her respects to the Queen. Just feet away when Kate, William, Harry and Meghan came
to speak to the crowd, she was disappointed not to get the chance to talk to
them. âBut honestly it was amazing to see them. Kate was bending to see all the children, if she heard
anyone say her name she would turn around and try to talk to them - like
the Queen did,"" she said. âThey really seem to understand the nation has lost the
Queen too - theyâre allowing us to grieve with them.â Julia from London was also close enough to catch a glimpse of the royals but didnât manage to speak to them. âThis morning on TV William looked very sombre
but now he was smiling. I could see Harry on the other side and he was reaching up high, trying to reach as many hands as possible,"" she said. Read more from about the scene in Windsor here.

The US House of Representatives has just observed a momentâs silence for the Queen. The lower chamber of Congress passed a bereavement resolution in honour of the late British sovereign, before adjourning for the day. Congressional leaders from both parties last week issued statements of tribute to the Queen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the monarch âwas a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedomâ. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Queen ârepresented what it means to lead with conviction, selflessness, and faith in God and in her peopleâ. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr
Rowan Williams, has been discussing the challenges facing the King and the UK as
the country enters a new phase in its history. Dr Williams told the BBCâs Newscast
podcast: âWeâre a society staring into a little bit of an abyss in the next few
months, where poverty and deprivation for quite a lot of people, are going to
be a major issue.â Talking about the role of King Charles
III, he said: âI think it is crucial that the new King give the message... that
he's committed to a society where nobody gets forgotten.â He went on to say: âLots of communities
are faced with really impossible choices about energy, about food, about their
general security. Itâs the biggest thing I know on the agenda of the new prime
minister and the new government. Itâs a watershed moment for them just as much
as for the monarchy.â Dr Williams said: âIf we can get through
this winter without collapse, we can manage with all those pressures, we will
have sent a very important message to the other end of Europe that we are
prepared to face some constraints for the sake of Ukraine.â Last Thursday, the government set
out its energy support plan which included limiting energy bill rises for all
households for two years, and six months for businesses. Newscastâs full interview with Dr Williams

of the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state in London - and I have joined them. The group has grown to around 100 people and we will
be the first to enter Westminster Hall on Thursday evening. For now though, we
are waiting on the Albert Embankment Path near Lambeth Bridge, huddling
underneath umbrellas and wearing ponchos to shelter from the rain. Some have been here all day, including 85-year-old
Truus Nayman, who is spending the night sat on a bench. âItâs a very special atmosphere,â she said. Despite the rain, spirits remain high as people swap
stories about the Queen. There is a real sense of camaraderie as strangers
strike up close friendships to support one another as we wait - including
holding a spot in the line while neighbours go to the toilet or grab a coffee. âIâve got two friends and we will be doing a rota,"" said
Monica Farag. âThese will be my friends forever.â Westminster Hall is where King Charles III addressed members of parliament and peers on Monday - and where the Queen's coffin will lie in state from Wednesday. Built in 1097, the building has played a significant role in British history for centuries. It has hosted the trials of Charles I and Guy Fawkes, Henry VIII's coronation banquet, and speeches by well-known figures such as Nelson Mandela, French President Charles de Gaulle, Pope Benedict, and US President Barack Obama. The last member of the Royal Family to lie in state at Westminster was the Queen Mother in 2002, when more than 200,000 people queued to view her coffin. But it is not only royals who have lain in state in Westminster Hall. The same honour was extended to former Prime Minister Winston Churchill following his death in 1965 and to the victims of theR101 airship disaster of 1930. From Wednesday, the Queen's closed coffin will rest on a raised platform, known as a catafalque, beneath the 11th Century hall's medieval timber roof. Each corner of the platform will be guarded in a continuous vigil by soldiers that serve the Royal Household. The coffin will be draped in the Royal Standard and once in Westminster Hall it will be topped with the Imperial State Crown, orb and sceptre. Westminster Hall during Barack Obama's address in 2011 The Queen's coffin is now at rest at Buckingham Palace. The 775-room palace was her primary residence from the year of her coronation in 1953 until the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020. But the late monarch is said to have held mixed feelings towards the grand home. According to royal biographer Penny Junor in her book The Firm, the Queen had originally wanted to settle in Clarence House in London - where she had lived with her late husband Prince Philip after they were married in 1947. But following her coronation in 1953, Sir Winston Churchill, the prime minister at the time, pushed for the couple to move to Buckingham Palace, according to Junor. The Queen went onto live in Buckingham Palace's private quarters until 2020, when she made the move to Windsor Castle at the start of the pandemic. The Queen's coffin will travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday afternoon, where she will lie in state for four days. The King, his two sons Princes William and Harry, and other senior royals will walk behind the coffin. Watch the route the procession will take below: This video can not be played The King will be joined by his sons Princes William and Harry in a procession accompanying the Queenâs coffin from Buckingham Palace to
Parliament on Wednesday. The procession will leave the palace just after lunchtime and will arrive at Westminster Hall, where the Queen will lie in state for four days. The King will also be joined by his siblings Prince Andrew, the Princess Royal, and the Earl of Wessex. Peter Phillips, vice admiral Sir
Tim Laurence, the Duke of Gloucester and the Earl of Snowdon will also walk behind the coffin. Camilla, the Queen Consort, the Princess of Wales, the Countess of
Wessex and the Duchess of Sussex will travel to the hall by car. A short service lasting around 20 minutes will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury accompanied by the Dean of Westminster. Toby LuckhurstReporting in London Barriers are being erected outside Parliament ahead of the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall Authorities in London are preparing for huge numbers of people to pay their respects to the Queen as she lies in state in Westminster Hall for four days from Wednesday. Dozens of people in hi-vis jackets lined the
queueing route, snaking along the South Bank past St Thomasâ Hospital and
across Lambeth Bridge to the Palace of Westminster. Poorna was one of those working on the
bridge. He arrived at 6am for a 13 hour shift. ""There's a
night shift too,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long one."" On the north side of the river, rope lines are staked out in the grass of Victoria Tower Gardens, south of the Palace of
Westminster. Forklifts drop off portable toilet blocks in the
garden while security stand guard. Police have arrived from across the country
to help with the operation - with vans from the Lancashire Constabulary sitting just off
Parliament Square. The route for people queuing to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall in Parliament has been released by the government. The line will start at Albert Embankment near Lambeth Bridge, and could stretch all the way to Southwark Park in south-east London. Those queuing are asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Once people reach the front of the queue, they will have to go through airport-style security before entering Parliament. Get more detailshere.
