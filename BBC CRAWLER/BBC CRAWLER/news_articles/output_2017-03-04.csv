Bellew beats an injured Haye in the 11th,"Bellew has now won 29 of his 32 fights Missed the fight? Listen to a repeat of the commentary every hour on Sunday from 06:00-13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra WBC cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew produced a stunning upset to stop bitter rival David Haye in a thrilling heavyweight contest at London's O2 Arena. The Liverpudlian, 34, pounced when Haye suffered what turned out to be an Achilles injury in the sixth round to score a knockdown. Haye, who had his right ankle strapped, carried on as bravely as he could for the rest of the fight, but was unable to move freely as Bellew seized the momentum. And in the 11th, a second knockdown saw former heavyweight champion Haye tangled in the ropes, the towel enter from his corner and his hopes of a return to the world-title level of the sport left in tatters. Bellew - a big underdog with bookmakers - raced to trainer Dave Coldwell in celebration as he scored a victory which will likely filter through to non-boxing fans far more than his 2016 world-title win at Goodison Park did. Bellew: I asked Haye to throw in the towel Bellew broke his hand in early rounds of Haye bout Listen: 'Iâve beaten the best cruiserweight this country has ever produced' And the bitter war of words leading up to the fight ended with Bellew helping a limping and exhausted Haye back to his corner. The two embraced and the beaten, humbled Haye asked for a rematch during a lengthy post-fight interview before heading off to hospital to have surgery. Haye injured his right ankle in the sixth round The first round had those in the O2 Arena intrigued. A hate-fuelled slug-fest or artistic boxing? The latter won the day, with Bellew happy to see Haye jump in while he fired off solid replies in-between darting out of trouble. And so established a pattern, Haye taking the centre of the ring, Bellew nearer the ropes. As the established heavyweight stalked his man, often they stood statuesque for moments as Bellew looked for Haye's trigger - his own prompt to counter. But slipping shots can be a dangerous game and a straight right to Bellew's jaw in the fifth was audible ringside, though nothing could be heard in the sixth as the Arena screamed at the drama. Both men went down - Haye twice - though neither faced a count as their falls to the canvas were deemed slips but the sheer punch volume from Bellew then legally felled Haye, who looked stunned and shattered in answering a nine count. Bellew, who stressed his rival would start tiring after four rounds, was then able to dominate, dictating the pace and notably throwing everything at Haye in the seventh in attempt to bring an end to proceedings. Haye's low blow in the ninth summed up his increasing desperation and, two rounds later, his brave resistance was ended moments after a barrage of punches sent him sprawling through the ropes. Having clambered back into the ring, finally his camp threw in the towel, signalling the third defeat of a 31-fight career. Bellew, speaking to Radio 5 live:""He's probably the hardest puncher in the world, and he's so quick early on, he's like a sprinter. He can really hit but he can also take a few himself. ""In my eyes I've beaten the best cruiserweight this country has ever produced and one of the best heavyweights. I am honoured to fight in the same ring as him. I've looked up to him. ""He made the same mistake everybody else does. He underestimated me. Watch me on tape and I'm terrible but in the ring I'm harder to hit than you think."" Haye swung wildly at Bellew in the early rounds David Haye, also speaking to Radio 5 live:""I've knocked out guys a lot bigger and stronger but he has the heart of a lion. ""I gave it my best and it wasn't good enough. He was by far the better fighter tonight. He dug deep and took my best shots and put me down. ""I would love to do it again, I have never been in a fight like that. If the fans want to see it again I would do it again. We'll do it on his terms, in his town - he deserves it."" On his injury he said:""The ankle was just one of those things. The better man won on the night. ""It wasn't my night. I didn't land the good shots, I was in good shape but his game was better than mine. ""It felt like a Rocky movie and I was one punch away from knocking him out but I couldn't quite do it."" Haye was fighting in just his third fight since 2012 and he has now lost three times in his 31 fights Haye's graphic descriptions of his hopes of damaging Bellew in the run-up to the fight prompted concern from boxing authorities and undoubtedly turned some fans against him. But the bad blood meant the contest was expected to sell between 500,000 and 700,000 buys on pay-per-view. Eddie Hearn, Bellew's promoter, believed anything other than an explosive knockout would be a ""disaster"" for Haye, who will now have to either retire or embark on rebuilding his in-ring reputation. The 36-year-old will win plenty of plaudits for courageously battling on. But he was unable to land anything too meaningful prior to the critical sixth round. With this latest injury added to the reconstructive shoulder injury he received in 2013, have we seen the last of a fighter who once unified the cruiserweight division, won a heavyweight world title and of course took Wladimir Klitschko 12 rounds in defeat? A rematch with Bellew would be a money spinner, although many will call for retirement instead. Promoter Eddie Hearn on Radio 5 live:""We've got to go after a heavyweight world title for Bellew now. I am so pleased for him. He's secured the future for his family and they can live a wonderful life. ""He is everything you would want in a man, he has a big heart, never gives up, has a wonderful family and I am so happy for him."" Bellew is the reigning world cruiserweight champion Bellew's jump in weight to claim victory is perhaps even more impressive considering he has had just eight fights at cruiserweight, spending most of his career two divisions lower than the one he competed in in this exhilarating affair. He was an English champion at heavyweight at amateur, following in the footsteps of the ringside Frank Bruno, but few gave him hope - and those who did emphasised the survival mission he had on his hands in dodging Haye's early power. But he did, the 13 fights he has had since Haye briefly left the sport providing a sharpness his opposite number simply lacked. Roared on by the likes of Wayne Rooney and AP McCoy in attendance, he shone in a cauldron atmosphere, boxing admirably to complement his reputation as a power puncher. Bellew's stock has never been so high. Unification bouts in the cruiserweight division will likely present themselves and his adaptability in stepping up to over 200lbs could open doors in the sport's showpiece division. Haye and Bellew embraced at the end, despite the heated build-up to the fight Boxing pundit Steve Bunce on BBC Radio 5 live How much of an impact did that injury of Haye's have? I had Haye up four rounds to one going into the sixth but he didn't win a round after the injury. That was pure bravery and guts and up there with anything I've ever seen. They went to hell. It was sensational, scary but sensational. Had David Haye won in the first round or the 11th round, we wouldn't have questioned his eligibility to chase any heavyweight. Bellew didn't mention Anthony Joshua, so go and chase it, put an offer out to Joseph Parker, put an offer out to Deontay Wilder. In the summer, at Goodison Park, there will be enough money on the table to get those guys in the ring.

Laters.  Stoke 2-0 Middlesbrough Stoke City Stoke goalscorer Marko Arnautovic:âWe
came back as we wanted to and from the first minute we were on it, we should
have scored more goals, but we are happy with this win. âIâm happy with the two goals. âThe gaffer said we have to attack the ball in the box from
corners. Ryan Shawcross said he touched it as well, but itâs not about who
scores.â Swansea 3-2 Burnley Trevor SinclairEx-Man City & West Ham winger on Final Score The way the Swansea players reacted to that wrong penalty call was amazing. That comeback was fantastic. Liverpool 1-0 Arsenal Liverpool have taken the lead against Arsenal, Roberto Firmino with the goal after 10 minutes. You can follow that gamehere. West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace goalscorer Andros Townsend:""It was the perfect away game. We wanted to get a point and our plan was to hit them on the counter. We followed that to a tee.Â ""We're moving in the right direction. It has been coming. We have been putting in a lot of time on the training ground, it was only matter of time for it to come through on the pitch. ""To do that against the side in eighth place in the Premier League is fantastic."" West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace West Brom defender Craig Dawson:Â ""A defeat like this is disappointing but sometimes it happens. We have got to bounce back.Â ""They made it hard for us, we had a few chances we couldn't take and we lacked that final pass. ""But were in a good position and hopefully we can get back on track."" West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace goalscorer Wilfred Zaha on his side's second straight win:""The team is buzzing because we have not performed how we know we can perform in the past few months. ""We're doing the basics right and when you start doing the basics right everything else works out. We've nailed that down."" West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Palace boss Sam Allardyce:""We're putting it right on constant basis. It's now difficult to score against Palace. The quality of goals today will win football matches.Â ""I've seen what was happening at Palace, like I saw at Sunderland and Blackburn. I told the lads this is how you stop it.Â ""It's about getting positions right, passes right and being resilient against the opposition. Those basics have to be worked on constantly.Â ""There's a lot of technology about. We donât have to spend too much time on the training ground - this can be done using visuals. On Patrick van Aanholt's injury:""We'll see about him. We don't have a game for two weeks so he has that time to recover."" West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Tony Pulis:Â ""No excuses today. We weren't at it right from the start. Congratulations to Palace. ""I'm not going to criticise the players because they have been fantastic this year. We've had an off day and I hope that is all it is. ""Why was it an off day? If I knew I'd be a genius. We've worked hard and trained hard this week. We were tepid right from the very beginning. On whether his side are guilty of switching off mentally after reaching the 40-point mark:""Complacency is the most annoying word in dictionary. It is human nature to switch off a little bit sometimes. People are people - sometimes they have good days, sometimes they have bad days."" Garth's relegation prediction Garth CrooksFormer Spurs striker on Final Score I put my neck on the line now, I think the three at the bottom will go down - Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Hull. Stoke 2-0 Middlesbrough Stoke City Stoke boss Mark Hughes:âIt was important to bounce back. We
didnât do ourselves any favours at Tottenham last week. We had something to
prove. âIt was a deserved lead in the first half, two good goals
from Marko Arnautovic. We could have won more comprehensively. âWhen he times those runs in behind he is very difficult to
knock off his stride, heâs a big guy with lots of power. Heâs got that
potential.â Leicester 3-1 Hull Hull City Hull boss Marco Silva:""It is good when you play well and are close to the result, but most importantly we need to take points. We were better in the first half and scored from a counter-attack. They had a good reaction but after half time, the score was fair. ""We had two good chances in the second half, but they ended up scoring two. We did not put the ball into the net. ""The numbers are not good for us, that is clear. We need to fight but when you have chances to score, that is what makes the difference. ""We need to always fight, but we can rest and analyse the game now. We have to prepare for the next game against Swansea."" #bbcfootball Belete Com:A day full of controversy! I can't wait for Match of the Day. Andy Pittaway:The Burnley penalty decision was embarrassing - the sooner we use video technology the better. Simon:Absolute disaster for the North East if it stays like this - Middlesbrough, Hull & Sunderland in bottom three. Leicester 3-1 Hull John MotsonMatch of the Day commentator Well six points out of six for Leicester. That means the way I see it, I think Craig Shakespeare will keep his job until the end of the season, especially if Leicester beat Sevilla in the Champions League. Leicester 3-1 Hull Leicester City Leicester caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare:""We spoke to the players before the game, they showed resilience and character. It was against the run of play after going 1-0 down, but to bounce back showed the resilience in our side. ""Riyad Mahrez has been frustrated with himself. We told him to go out there and be himself. It is the Mahrez of old with the goal he scored. ""Results give players confidence. Back-to-back wins will give confidence for the last 11 games of the season. ""In terms of our points, it has been a turnaround. Everyone looked at the game against Liverpool on Monday and to get the three points under pressure was important but to back that up with another win was vitally important. Will he get the job full-time? ""I am comfortable. We have a few days away now. I have been kept informed. I am told we will have a chat at the end of next week. ""We know the last 11 games will have twist and turns, we need to take care of ourselves."" Stoke 2-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka:âIn this kind of moment we
need to be positive. We have to know we have done good things so far. âWe have to keep believing in this group of players. Until the
last day we will keep fighting. âWeâve played since I have been in here with one striker. We
train not one way but today was a normal decision. âWe are in the bottom three and we need to work harder to
leave those positions."" Asked if he was concerned about his job, Karanka said:""I can't be concerned about things not under my control."" League One  League Two West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Garth CrooksFormer Spurs striker on Final Score He's done it before. He's not a panicker. Players watch the manager and then react. I think with Sam Allardyce on the side line the players have the belief. Mamadou Sakho has been outstanding in the last two games, outstanding. West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal PalacemanagerSam Allardycesays he is taking his squad on a warm weather break following their second successive win. ""Because we don't play for two weeks we can relax, chill out, do some training in the heat and get ready for the big push,"" says the former England manager. ""They're looking forward to the trip because it has been a long slog. It has been a long slog for me and I've only been here since Christmas! ""They're relieving the pressure and if they take it the right way it will pay dividends."" West Brom 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce on his side's second successive win:Â ""This is a much bigger win than last weekend against Middlesbrough because to put back-to-back wins together here against West Brom at The Hawthorns is a big statement. ""It gives the players the confidence to push on and get out of the position we're in. It was a quality performance and we deserved the three points.Â ""In terms of catching up on games and points, back-to-back wins makes such a big difference. We're working in that bottom seven league and trying to win that. ""We did the basics so well and the quality of both goals topped it. West Brom barely had a shot on goal. ""I said the new players would make a difference and they have done that."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Dull Budget? Your finances will change anyway,"Consider Wednesday's Budget as part of a box set - the latest episode in a financial drama that began with the banking crisis. Like all good series, there are episodes which allow the scriptwriters to set up the story for a more dramatic encounter later on. That will be the case with Philip Hammond - ironically nicknamed ""Box Office Phil"" - as he writes his Spring Budget, experts say. They predict this Budget will be relatively low key, particularly because there will be another one in the autumn. And - to stretch the metaphor even further - we have been told a lot about the plot already. A string of tax and benefit changes that will come into effect this April have been announced in previous Budgets and Autumn Statements. So, here is the story so far. Spring Budget: in depth Chancellor Hammond's Â£10bn of green shoots Jump in death fees for large estates Labour says Â£1m earners should publish tax returns This will be the last ever Spring Budget, with the main event moving to the autumn from then on. The leading man in the Treasury has changed. Philip Hammond is delivering his first Budget as chancellor, following eight delivered by his predecessor George Osborne. There's plenty of speculation that Wednesday's Budget could be pretty low key. Don't be fooled, though. Your finances are set to change anyway. Some of the policies that affect UK residents' personal finances were announced in previous speeches by Mr Osborne, but will only take effect this April. Others were outlined by Mr Hammond in November's Autumn Statement and will also come into force in the spring. A number will lead to a notable change in the finances of those of working age - particularly a shift in the income tax threshold and the benefit freeze - while others target particular groups of people such as landlords. The amount people can earn before they are subject to income tax, known as the personal allowance, is currently set at Â£11,000 and it has already been announced that it will go up to Â£11,500 in April. The Conservatives have promised to raise this to Â£12,500 by 2020-21 and increase with inflation after that. The threshold for the higher 40% income tax rate will rise from Â£43,000 to Â£45,000 in April. However, in Scotland the higher rate will be paid on income above Â£43,000 a year - owing to the devolved tax powers the Scottish government now holds. Other changes that had been announced by George Osborne, but which take effect in April, include: Many working-age benefits remaining unchanged for a second year, as part of a four-year freeze. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. However, state pensions, Maternity Pay and disability benefits are excluded The launch of a newLifetime Individual Savings Account(LISA) for those aged between 18 and 40. They can save up to Â£4,000 a year, and the government will add a 25% bonus if the money is used to buy a home or as a pension from the age of 60 The start of a gradual process allowing people topass on property to their descendants free from some inheritance tax Any family which has a third or subsequent child born after April will not qualify for Child Tax Credit, which can be more than Â£2,000 per child. This will also apply to families claiming Universal Credit for the first time after April The family element of child tax credits, worth Â£545 per year, will be abolished. So families in which the eldest child is born on or after 6 April will not receive this payment. Many buy-to-let landlords will see the amount oftax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest paymentscut over the course of four years from April. They will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Pay rates for millions of workers have already been cemented. The National Living Wage will rise from Â£7.20 to Â£7.50 in April, for those aged 25 and over. Public sector pay has already been set at a 1% annual rise each year until 2019-20. Salary sacrifice schemes allow some employees to give up some of their salary in exchange for goods and services. Some items bought under a scheme such as computers, gym membership, and health screening will be subject to tax from April - in effect, salary sacrifice will be cancelled on these items. That was announced in Mr Hammond's Autumn Statement, as was mixed news for drivers. Fuel duty will be frozen for a seventh year, but the cost of vehicle insurance may rise owing to an increase in the Insurance Premium Tax from 10% to 12% in June. NewVehicle Excise Duty (VED) bandsare to be introduced for cars registered from April - zero, standard and premium. In May,probate fees will change, costing significantly more for large estates. Finally, we may hear from the chancellor on a start date and precise interest rate for the new government-backed savings bond. In November, the chancellor said that the new savings product offering a ""market-leading"" rate of about 2.2% would go on sale through National Savings and Investments in the spring. The bond will be open to those aged 16 and over, subject to a minimum investment limit of Â£100 and a maximum investment limit of Â£3,000. Savers must put in their money for three years.
