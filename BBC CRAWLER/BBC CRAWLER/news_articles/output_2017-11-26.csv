Oxford Circus pair released by police,"Armed police responded to the incident as if it was terror-related Two men questioned over an altercation that sparked panic in London's Oxford Street on Friday have been released without charge, police have said. The pair - aged 21 and 40 - were quizzed on Saturday after attending a police station voluntarily. British Transport Police are investigating after panic erupted inside Oxford Circus Tube station. A number of people were injured, with nine hospitalised, after people fled the station amid reports of shooting. Armed police were sent to the scene and initially treated the incident as potentially terror-related. However, officers said they had found no evidence that any gunshots were fired. Police later said the incident - which resulted in the temporary closure of two Tube stations - may have been caused by an altercation between two men on a Central Line platform. They released CCTV images of two men they wanted to speak to in connection with the incident. Confirming that two men had now been released, a spokeswoman for British Transport Police said: ""There are no criminal proceedings against them. ""They have not been arrested or charged."" Officers are still going through CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses, the force said. No further suspects are being sought. Oxford Circus - where Oxford Street and Regent Street meet - was cordoned off Oxford Circus - where Oxford Street and Regent Street meet - was cordoned off during the incident, while shops and businesses were placed in lockdown. Shoppers were barricaded inside stores in Oxford Street, as armed police were deployed. However, within 90 minutes the officers had been stood down. Paramedics said people were injured in the rush to flee the station, described by eyewitnesses as a ""stampede"".

PM vows to cover Arena attack costs,"Twenty-two people died in the attack at Manchester Arena on 22 May The government will fully fund the costs of dealing with the Manchester Arena attack, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. It comes after Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said an initial offer was""not good enough"". But the PMtold the Manchester Evening News,external: ""Be in no doubt, Manchester will get the financial support it needs."" She added in a statement that a Cabinet Office task force had been set up to oversee meeting the costs. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a device that killed 22 people and injured 512 in the foyer of the venue at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Andy Burnham said an initial government offer was ""not good enough"" The government had previously said Manchester would receive Â£12m to help cover the ""exceptional costs"" of the attack, with Â£3m being made available immediately. But Mr Burnham said more than Â£17.5m had already been spent and suggested at least Â£10.4m more could be needed, including for the inquests into the 22 deaths and an inquiry. The Â£12m figure would have meant local authorities being forced to cut services to make up the Â£5m shortfall on what had already been spent, he warned. On Friday, Mr Burnham outlined,externalÂ£10.5m projected costs to add to the Â£17.5m already spent. These are: Coroner's inquest - Â£5m Promotion of Greater Manchester as a ""safe, attractive"" tourist destination - Â£4m We Love Manchester Emergency Fund - Â£1.1m Arena inquiry costs - Â£320,000 Mrs May said the government would meet the ""unexpected and exceptional costs"" Mrs May told the Manchester Evening News: ""Be in no doubt, Manchester will get the financial support it needs - and if that costs Â£28m, as Andy Burnham has estimated, then that is what we will make available."" She added in a statement that the attack was ""one of the darkest moments in the city's history"". ""I promised in the wake of that appalling atrocity this government would do all it could to help victims recover and the city to heal. I repeat that commitment today,"" she said. ""Where your public services have had to bear, or will bear, unexpected and exceptional costs in coping with this terrible attack, these will be met by the government. ""The process of making those payments is ongoing and I understand the frustration felt at the pace of delivery. ""So I have taken steps to speed up our response. Over the weekend a taskforce has been established within the Cabinet Office to oversee progress and expedite payments when necessary."" Mrs May added that not all the funding would be needed immediately. ""For example the inquests, opened and adjourned this month, will not begin until next June,"" she said.

Food aid enters Yemen port after blockade,"Millions are on the brink of famine in Yemen, the UN says A UN aid ship carrying food supplies has been allowed to dock at a rebel-held port in Yemen, after the Saudi-led coalition eased a blockade that has lasted for nearly three weeks. The blockade worsened the plight of millions at risk of starvation. Planes carrying medical supplies were allowed to land in the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday but this is the first shipment of food aid to be let in. The blockade was imposed on 6 November after a missile attack on Saudi Arabia. The coalition blocked off land, sea and air routes two days after the Houthi rebels they are fighting in Yemen fired the missile at the Saudi capital, Riyadh. It was intercepted over the international airport. The UN ship, loaded with thousands of tonnes of desperately-needed wheat, has arrived at the port of Saleef. It is carrying enough food to feed 1.8m people in northern Yemen for a month, World Food Programme country director Stephen Anderson told the BBC. Yemen: Finding near-famine - and lots of food Who is fighting whom? Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles He said the ship had been forced to ""hover off the coast"" for two weeks waiting for permission to enter. A commercial ship carrying 5,500 tonnes of wheat flour earlier docked at the key port of Hudaydah, south of Saleef and also controlled by the Houthi rebels. ""This is also a positive development because humanitarian aid alone will not address the full needs of the people who are in northern Yemen, particularly those who we are not able to assist, those who are slightly better off and who depend on markets,"" Mr Anderson said. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Myrie reports from one hospital on the brink of running out of fuel Earlier this week, the Saudi-led coalition announced it would reopen access to the Hudaydah port for urgent humanitarian aid and Sanaa's airport to UN aid and relief flights. But on Friday, the UN's humanitarian affairs office said access to Hudaydah remained blocked. The easing of the Saudi-led blockade followed a review by the coalition to ensure weapons do not reach the rebels. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, which Tehran denies. Planes that arrived in Sanaa on Saturday carried 1.9m doses of vaccines, but the UN's agency for children, Unicef, says that is just a small fraction of what is needed. ""I reiterate my plea to everyone with a heart for children, indeed not to prevent us from delivering what is urgently needed and massively needed,"" Unicef Middle East Director Geert Cappelaere told Reuters news agency. ""Yesterday was just a very small step."" More than 20 million people in Yemen are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Eleven million of those are children and 400,000 are affected by severe acute malnutrition. The coalition intervened in the war between forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Houthis in 2015. Since then ground fighting and air strikes have killed more than 8,670 people, according to UN figures.

Mugabe 'still has political role to play',"This video can not be played Father Fidelis Mukonori says he can't confirm reports that Robert Mugabe was given $10m (Â£7.5m) Robert Mugabe will continue to have a role to play in Zimbabwean politics, the Jesuit priest who helped negotiate his resignation has told the BBC. Father Fidelis Mukonori said he would provide ""advice"" as an elder statesman, including to the new president. Mr Mugabe, 93, resigned on Tuesday after a military intervention and days of mass protests. Mr Mukonori said he could not confirm reports that the ex-leader was granted $10m (Â£7.5m) to ease him out of office. Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in to replace Mr Mugabe as president on Friday. Mr Mnangagwa, long a close ally of Mr Mugabe, was sacked earlier this month, triggering the political crisis that eventually saw his boss's downfall. Father Mukonori, 70, who is close to Robert Mugabe and acted as a mediator between him and the military, said the new president would go to his predecessor for political counsel. ""In the African world, senior citizens are there for advice,"" he told the BBC's Richard Galpin at a church outside the capital, Harare, after leading a service that included prayers giving thanks for the peaceful transfer of power. He referred to what Mr Mnangagwa said about his predecessor at his inauguration. ""When he says 'he's my father, he's my leader, he's my mentor', you tell me he's going to stay off from his father, from his mentor, from his leader? I don't think so."" Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? The priest said that Mr Mugabe and his wife Grace remained at their house in Harare and had no plans to leave the country. The military takeover came in response to Mr Mugabe's decision to position Grace as his successor and sack Mr Mnangagwa from the vice-presidency. Father Mukonori said he could not confirmreports that the ex-president was granted millions of dollars and promised that his assets would not be touched to persuade him to step down.,external ""We didn't offer him anything... He resigned for the good of Zimbabwe,"" he said. He added: ""What I have read in the newspapers is about immunity [from prosecution], and that he will be looked after like any other former head of state."" Mr Mugabe leaving power, he added, was the best thing he had ever done. This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Separately on Sunday, Robert Mugabe was described as being ""quite jovial"" by a nephew in an interview with the French news agency AFP. ""He is actually looking forward to his new life - farming and staying at the rural home. He has taken it well,"" Leo Mugabe said. He said that Grace wanted to focus on already announced plans to buildthe controversial $1bn Robert Mugabe Universityin Mazowe, near Harare. Archbishop ends 10-year Mugabe protest Zimbabwe leader to 're-engage' with world Ex-minister faces fraud charges There are fears that President Mnangagwa, who is associated with some of worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980, will not usher in the democratic reforms that many in Zimbabwe are hoping for.

Mum's last wish honours Hillsborough fans,"Some football fans used pitch-side hoardings as stretchers at the Hillsborough stadium A plaque paying tribute to survivors of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster who helped rescue fans has been unveiled as a last wish of a victim's mother. Ninety-six fans died and many were hurt after a crush at Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. The plaque is the final wish of the late Hillsborough justice campaigner Anne Williams, who wanted to credit those who tried to save her son Kevin. It was unveiled at Liverpool Central Station in front of a large crowd. Many fans gave first aid and used pitch-side advertising hoardings as makeshift stretchers after the crush at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium on 15 April 1989. Anne Williams asked her brother Danny (top) to set up a tribute Before her death in 2013, Mrs Williams asked her brother Danny Gordon to set up a tribute to the disaster's survivors. Mr Gordon said it was ""her last legacy"". ""Being from Formby, she regularly got the train to Liverpool Central to attend her meetings for justice in town, so it's really special to have it there,"" he added. The plaque pays tribute to survivors who helped Mr Gordon commissioned it after many of the survivors and families ""gave their approval and expressed how much it would mean to them"", a spokeswoman for the event said. Merseyrail agreed to put up the plaque at Liverpool Central after Mr Gordon struggled to find a permanent home for it. Jan Chaudhry-van der Velde, managing director at Merseyrail, added: ""It will be seen by hundreds of thousands of passengers, who will be able to pay tribute to the survivors, which is exactly what she would have wanted."" In 2016, new inquests concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. Earlier this year, it was announced thatformer Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughterwhile five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the disaster.

Miners' strike student party a 'disgrace',"The organisers said to expect ""a confrontation bigger than the Battle of Orgreave"" A miners' strike-themed student rugby club event has been criticised as ""disgraceful"" and swiftly cancelled. Guests had been asked to come dressed as miners or members of Margaret Thatcher's government. The Facebook invitation said: ""We want flat caps, filth... a few working-class-beating-bobbies wouldn't go amiss."" Durham University said the event was ""wholly unacceptable"". The organisers have been approached for comment. Pro-vice chancellor Owen Adams said: ""Durham University and Trevelyan College utterly deplore this event."" It had been cancelled by the students concerned, he said. ""We are speaking to those students and we are considering what further action to take in due course,"" he added. The Facebook invitation was headlined Backs v Forwards Organisers of the event, who appeared to be associated with the rugby team at Trevelyan College, asked those playing different positions in the game to take the opposing sides in the 1984 dispute. Forwards were asked to come as miners and to ""think pickaxes... think headlamps... think 12% unemployment in 1984"". Backs were asked to elect one member to be ""the Iron Lady herself"" with others coming as her government, police officers or Falklands War heroes. Guests were told to ""expect a confrontation bigger than the Battle of Orgreave"". Trevelyan College authorities said they deplored the proposed event County Durham has a rich mining history with, at its height, tens of thousands of miners working in pits across the area. The strike saw arrests and clashes between miners and police in villages such as Easington Colliery. The Durham Miners' Association said it was ""appalled"" to hear about the event and pleased the university and college had taken ""swift and appropriate action"". Twitter users called the event ""disgraceful"" and ""disgusting"". They said the organisers had a ""complete lack of respect for local history"" and ""ought to be ashamed"".

Surgeons call to save leading heart unitThe congenital heart disease surgery unit at Royal Brompton Hospital is earmarked for closure.3h3 hours agoLondon,"Royal Brompton is the largest specialist heart and lung medical centre in the UK Two of Britain's top surgeons have called on NHS England to save a world-leading heart unit in London. Heart transplant pioneer Sir Magdi Yacoub and cancer surgeon Lord Darzi said ending congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery at Royal Brompton Hospital would be a ""disaster"". An NHS England's review,externalrecommends ending children's congenital heart surgery at Royal Brompton. The decision ""has been guided"" by medical experts, NHS England said. In an open letter, Lord Darzi, Sir Magdi and Baroness Boothroyd, a former patient of the hospital, said if Royal Brompton's CHD unit went it would render the whole hospital ""unviable"". In an open letter former health minister Lord Darzi claimed NHS England ""deliberately"" defined new guidelines to dismantle CHD services at the Royal Brompton Royal Brompton is the largest specialist heart and lung medical centre in the UK and works with the children's unit at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, less than half-a-mile away. But the hospital fails to meet new national guidelines for paediatric heart surgery, which require all children's services to be ""co-located"" on a single site. If paediatric heart surgery was removed, the hospital may struggle to meet its targets of having at least three heart surgeons, each carrying out a minimum of 125 operations a year, which would put the whole CHD surgery unit under threat. The letter claims that the new guidelines have been ""defined in such as way as to deliberately result in the dismantling of the services at the Brompton"". ""You shouldn't kill a centre of excellence just for planning reasons,"" Sir Magdi said. ""Closing the Royal Brompton heart surgery unit would be a disaster."" He added: ""Anything that comes after won't be as good treating patients and making medical advancements."" A spokesman for NHS England said ""isolated children's services are unacceptable; children's cardiac services must be co-located within a hospital providing a broad range of paediatric specialties and services"". The guidelines are supported by medical experts from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, British Congenital Cardiac Association, British Heart Foundation and the Royal College of Anaesthetists. A decision will be announced on 30 November.

UK drone users to sit safety tests,"Drone users in the UK may have to take safety awareness tests under legislation planned by the government. Drones weighing more than 250g could also be banned from flying near airports, or above 400 ft, in a crackdown on unsafe flying. Police will also be given new powers to seize and ground drones which may have been used in criminal activity. The bill has been welcomed by the pilots' union, which has warned of near misses involving drones and aircraft. Balpa said there had been 81 incidents so far this year - up from 71 in 2016 and 29 in 2015. The union's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""These proposals are a step towards the safe integration of drones, but until the new rules are in place the threat of a serious collision remains."" In July a drone flew directly over the wing of a large passenger jet as it came into land at London's Gatwick Airport,which a report said had put 130 lives at risk. Drones scatter mosquitoes to fight diseases The flying drones that can scan packages night and day Drone detects heartbeat and breathing rates The proposed bill - to be published in spring 2018 - would ensure that owners of drones weighing more than 250g would need to register and sit a test. Drone pilot and trainer Elliott Corke, director of The Aerial Academy, said most recreationally and commercially-used drones in use weighed more than 250g, apart from the cheap toy versions. He told BBC News that many new users were surprised by how many rules around drone usage already exist, under the Civil Aviation Authority'sDrone Code,external. He said there was a ""degree of frustration"" however that the rules were not being enforced effectively, allowing criminal activity to take place. This video can not be played Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners Serena Kennedy, Assistant Chief Constable of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), told BBC Breakfast: ""At the moment we're using other bits of legislation - the Civil Aviation Authority's - to enable us to take action. ""This draft legislation will give us the powers we need to tackle drones when they are being used for criminal purposes."" She said it would help police tackle the ""increasing problem"" of drones delivering items, such as drugs and mobile phones, to prisons. She said the legislation could allow police to look at how they can protect prison establishments from criminal drone activity through geo-fencing, which programmes no-fly zones into drones using GPS co-ordinates. This video can not be played Drones should be flown no higher than 400ft Christian Struwe, head of European public policy at drone maker DJI, warned that some of the proposals may be ""difficult to police"" - for example the height restriction. But he told BBC Breakfast: ""The good thing is that as an industry we are already working on it. We can limit how high they can fly."" Mr Struwe pointed out that there was no ""hard limit"" on how close drones could fly to airports. ""The current wording is that you should stay well clear,"" he said. He welcomed the proposals to limit the ""bad use"" of drones, adding that it was important people were aware there was regulation they needed to follow. Mr Corke agreed that there was a ""lack of awareness"" of the Drone Code, and said he was frustrated by the lack of focus on practical training. ""Most people don't read the manual or learn the safety features before they use their drones"", he said, adding that many did not know what to do if something malfunctioned. Alongside the new laws, the government is also keen to develop technology allowing the greater use of drones for tasks including deliveries of everything from shopping to human organs. The transport minster, Lady Sugg, said the government wanted to strike the right balance between harnessing drone potential and ensuring they are not misused. ""We're bringing forward this legislation in order to ensure that drones can be used safely, whilst also addressing some of the safety and privacy concerns that people have,"" she said. The government is also working with drone manufacturers on technology which produces virtual barriers, to stop the machines operating in restricted areas. Drones to spot new Ystalyfera landslips.

'Red warning' to airlines over Bali volcano,"This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows ash rising into the sky, disrupting flights Airlines have been issued a ""red warning"" about the danger of volcanic ash in the skies close to Bali after Mount Agung emitted a thick plume of smoke reaching 4,000m (13,100 feet). It is the second major emission from the Indonesian island volcano this week, and flights have been disrupted. The red warning means an eruption is forecast to be imminent,external, with significant emission of ash likely. Authorities have begun distributing masks in some areas as ash falls. Bali is a major tourist destination, although the main resorts of Kuta and Seminyak are about 70km (43 miles) from the volcano. The island's main airport is for now operating normally, but some airlines have cancelled flights. Volcanic ash can damage plane engines. Travellers to and from the region are being urged tocontact their airline or travel agent,externalto find out the status of their flight. Ash from the eruption coated roads, cars and buildings near the volcano in the north-east of Bali and emergency officials said hundreds of thousands of masks had been distributed The ash cloud is said to be moving eastward from Bali towards the island of Lombok, and the main international airport there has been closed entirely. The information director of Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency tweeted that volcanic ash rain had fallen on the Lombok city of Mataram. Bali volcano: What is it like waiting for an eruption? Indonesia: Volcano nation ""Tourism in Bali is still safe, except in the danger (zone) around Mount Agung,"" the agency said in a statement. It told people within a 7.5km exclusion zone to ""immediately evacuate"" in an ""orderly and calm manner"". Magma - molten rock - has now been detected close to the volcano's surface, said officials and volcanologists. Passengers waiting at Bali's Ngurah Rai airport on Saturday About 25,000 people are thought to still be in temporary shelters after more than 140,000 people fled earlier this year. Increased volcanic activity had prompted fears a major eruption was imminent. Most of the islanders outside the immediate exclusion zone were ordered to return home at the end of September,and the mountain has been intermittently rumbling since. This video can not be played Evacuees from near Mount Agung brought their birds, chickens and dogs with them in September According to official estimates, the holiday island lost at least $110m (Â£83m) in tourism and productivity during the major evacuation. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. It is home to more than 130 active volcanoes. The last time Mount Agung erupted, in 1963, more than 1,000 people died. This video can not be played Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted Are you in the area?

Valtteri Bottas ends it on a high note by taking victory in Abu Dhabi, with world champion Lewis Hamilton having to settle for second. Until next time, thanks and goodbye. In case you have missed it,listen to the best 10 radio pieces of team radiowith our rundown here. Featuring Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, Esteban Ocon, Daniel Ricciardo plus much more. Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer at Yas Marina Valtteri Bottas held off team-mate Lewis Hamilton asMercedes cruised to a dominant one-twoin the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton, who won his fourth world championshiptwo races before the end of the season,appeared quicker in the second part of the race. But he could not get quite close enough to challenge for the lead in a drab andlargely action-free finale. Sebastian Vettelwas outclassed in third placeto underline the anti-climatic way in which Ferrari have ended a season that had for so long promised so much. Rob Smedley, who has been Felipe Massa's engineer throughout much of his career, tells Sky Sports:""It will be weird coming to a grand prix and him not being there. He is just someone to sit down with on a Friday night. It is like carrying your pint-sized mate around. ""We will see lots of each other. That won't change. He will carry on racing. It is in his blood. This is undoubtedly the right time to be retiring in Formula 1. He should have won race this year in Azerbaijan. Weekend in, weekend out, we rely on him. And on Williams' plan to replace the Brazilian, Smedley said:""The evaluation process is ongoing. We will be doing more this week. ""There is no reason to rush into it. We are the best remaining seat so we have that advantage that we can wait and evaluate every little bit."" Some quotes fromFelipe Massa,after his last ever Formula 1 race, said: ""It was really a great pleasure to be here for 16 years. The race was good today. ""I am so lucky to pass through all this racing in many great teams, fighting the best drivers in the world. Thank you for following me and supporting me all this time. I am very lucky to have this in my life. ""I will miss many things."" Lewis Hamilton, speaking to Sky Sports:""We can celebrate tonight but I don't fancy it too much. ""We have testing on Tuesday then I go to Malaysia and Germany and back to the UK. ""I will probably get some time off on the 18th and do some skiing, see the family and dogs.""

Force India team boss Otmar Szafnauer has told Sky Sports the penalty given to Nico Hulkenberg during the race ""makes a mockery of the sport"". Hulkenberg cut the corner when overtaking Force India's Sergio Perez and was given a five-second penalty rather than being forced to give the place back. That allowed Renault to go on and take the points they needed to climb into sixth in the constructors championship. ""They gain a place in the constructors championship which means more money for next year,"" Szafnauer said. ""Itmakes a mockery of the sport to have it so inconsistent."" Renault's Nico Hulkenberg after securing sixth place in the constructors championship, speaking to Sky Sports:""I knew I had a five second gap but when I realised the pit stop was taking longer I was getting a bit nervous. It turned out OK. ""I had to fight a little bit to get past the Haas but once that was done it was just a scenario of managing it.""

Review over harassment at abortion clinics,"In October, Ealing councillors voted in favour of banning protesters from gathering outside an abortion clinic New laws could be introduced to protect women from harassment outside abortion clinics, the Home Office has said. An assessment of protests held outside clinics has been ordered by the home secretary, following concerns about the tactics used by some protesters. Amber Rudd said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated for accessing healthcare. But anti-abortion campaigners said it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest new powers, because women were not being harassed. The Home Office review will hear from police forces, healthcare providers and local authorities to understand the scale and nature of anti-abortion protests. Ealing abortion clinic protest ban approved Buffer zone plan for Portsmouth abortion clinic Abortion stories: From a 'sense of relief' to a 'broken heart' It will then consider what further action the government could take to protect those using or working in abortion clinics. This could include bolstering existing, or creating new, police and civil powers, the Home Office said. Ms Rudd said: ""While everyone has a right to peaceful protest, it is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated simply for exercising their legal right to healthcare advice and treatment. ""The decision to have an abortion is already an incredibly personal one, without women being further pressured by aggressive protesters."" She said the review would provide ""firm recommendations"" on action to tackle the problem. The police already have a range of powers to manage protests, with the law providing protection against harassment and intimidation. The Home Office said protesters were subject to the law and all suspected offences ""will be robustly investigated"". Amber Rudd said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated for accessing healthcare Labour MP Rupa Huq, who has campaigned for a law change, welcomed the review with ""cautious optimism"". In her Ealing Central and Acton constituency, the council backed a proposal in October that would ban protesters from gathering outside an abortion clinic. The demonstrators, who hold daily vigils outside the clinic, deny harassing women. Ms Huq said a radial zone to exclude protests within 150m was needed, banning silent praying, singing hymns, displaying foetus images and leaflet distribution. ""The complete anonymity of women seeking terminations should be protected as one would expect with any other NHS procedure,"" she said. But Antonia Tully, director of campaigns at the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said: ""It is completely ludicrous to suggest introducing new powers to stop small numbers of peaceful people praying outside abortion clinics and offering leaflets to women.

Glee star charged with hitting husband,"Glee star Naya Rivera has been charged with domestic violence against her husband. The 30-year-old, who played Santana in the TV show, was arrested at a house in Kanawha County, West Virginia, America. According to the criminal complaint, police were called for a domestic situation. Officers say they talked with Ryan Dorsey who told them his wife, Naya, had hit him in the head and face. Ryan Dorsey and Naya Rivera in 2015 Ryan, 34, showed officers mobile phone footage that supported what he says happened. They also say he had minor injuries. Naya was wearing a baggy hooded sweatshirt, leggings, sandals and handcuffs when officers walked her into a Kanawha County magistrate court just after midnight. A local reporter from TV station WSAZ filmed in the court office. In the footage Naya Rivera is told she's being charged with ""misdemeanor domestic battery"" and asked if she knew what she was being charged with, to which she replies: ""Yes your honour"". A Kanawha County magistrate set her bond for release at $1000. She then signs a document and leaves with her father-in-law. The reporter asks her if she wants to say anything, but she doesn't respond. Newsbeat spoke to Corporal Lester at Kanawha County Sheriff's department who confirmed the arrest and charge. In a statement police added: ""As is always the case in criminal matters, the charge against Mrs. Rivera is merely an accusation. She is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty."" Naya Rivera played cold-hearted high school cheerleader Santana in Glee from 2009 until 2015. In August she revealedshe'd had an abortionwhen she was pregnant with Ryan Dorsey's child in 2010 during a day off from filming Glee. The pair weren't a couple at the time, but in 2014 they married. They reportedly filed for divorce last year but recently decided to stay together. They have a two-year-old son.

Ireland 'to play tough' over Brexit talks,"The Irish Republic's EU commissioner has said Dublin will ""play tough to the end"" over its threat to veto Brexit talks moving on to discuss trade. The European Union has said ""sufficient progress"" has to be made on the Irish border before negotiations on the UK and EU's future relationship can begin. Phil Hogantold the Observer,externalstaying in the customs union would avoid the need for a hard border on the island. The DUP said Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK must not be different. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, which is in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative government, said she would not support ""any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations"". DUP hits out at Irish government's Brexit stance Brexit: All you need to know Six things to watch if Brexit puzzles you Downing Street has said the whole of the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in 2019. Labour said nothing should be done that endangers the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, while the Liberal Democrats said Tory divisions over Brexit were ""stoking tensions"". The EU has given Prime Minister Theresa May until 4 December to come up with further proposals on issues including the border, the Brexit divorce bill and citizens' rights, if European leaders are to agree to moving on to trade talks. But Mr Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner, accused some in the British government of having what he called a ""blind faith"" about securing a comprehensive free trade deal after Brexit. He said it was a ""very simple fact"" that ""if the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue"". In these circumstances regulations either side of the border would remain the same, and so a near invisible border would be possible. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has asked for assurances of no hard border The Irish government has always insisted there must not be a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar sayinghe must have written assurance from the UKbefore Brexit talks can move on.

But in her speech in Florence, this September, Mrs May restated that both the UK and EU will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border. Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News: ""We don't want there to be a hard border but the United Kingdom is going to be leaving the single market and customs union."" He said progress towards a deal must be quicker and accused EU negotiators of making the so-called ""divorce bill"" a sticking point, adding: ""We can't get a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state."" Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the Irish government was ""desperately worried"" about the possibility of a hard border. He said Labour had not ruled out advocating membership of the single market or, if necessary, some form of customs union. But he declined to commit to a preferred solution, arguing that Labour was not in government and therefore not involved in the Brexit talks. ""I'd be very happy if Theresa May wanted to move over and call that election and let us do that, but until we're round that table it's not sensible to say what you can get out of the negotiations,"" he said. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Government divisions over what Brexit means are stoking tensions. The government and its Brextremists must swallow their pride and do the right thing for Ireland and the UK. ""Leaving the EU does not have to mean leaving the single market and customs union."" Suggestions for alternate arrangements have included a new partnership that would ""align"" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in ""no customs border at all between the UK and Ireland"".

Fox: No Irish border deal before trade talks,"There can be no final decisions on the future of the Irish border until the UK and the EU have reached a trade agreement, Liam Fox has said. The UK's international trade secretary also blamed the EU for Brexit delays. The comments came after the Irish Republic's EU commissioner said Dublin could veto Brexit trade talks. The EU has said ""sufficient progress"" has to be made on the Irish border before negotiations on a future relationship can begin. Downing Street has said the whole of the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in 2019.

He added: ""We can't come to a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state. And until we get into discussions with the EU on the end state that will be very difficult - so the quicker we can do that the better, and we are still in a position where the EU doesn't want to do that."" Mr Fox accused the European Commission of having an ""obsession"" with ever-closer union between EU member states, which was delaying progress in Brexit talks. Phil Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner,told the Observer,externalthat staying in the customs union would negate the need for a hard border - with customs posts and possible passport checks - on the island. He said Dublin would ""play tough to the end"" over its threat to veto trade talks until it had guarantees over the border. DUP hits out at Irish government's Brexit stance Brexit: All you need to know Six things to watch if Brexit puzzles you Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""worried"" by Mr Fox's comments, adding that Labour would not take continued membership of the single market and the customs union off the table. ""I think the one thing that we don't want to do is jeopardise any movement quickly, because we need movement to enable us to get into the proper trade negotiations,"" Mr McDonnell told ITV's Peston on Sunday. ""So I'm hoping that isn't a Downing Street-sanctioned statement that's he's made."" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent It's 310 miles (499km) long - a squiggle on the map that meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is the soon-to-be frontier between the UK and the European Union. And right now it is the most troublesome frontier between Brexit negotiations stalling or progressing. London and Dublin each say they are committed to maintaining an open border. But Ireland wonders how that will be possible. Oh and one other thing to throw into the mix - after all the talk of how wobbly Theresa May's government is, so is Ireland's. There could be a general election there before Christmas. The EU has given Prime Minister Theresa May until 4 December to come up with further proposals on issues including the border, the Brexit divorce bill and citizens' rights, if European leaders are to agree to moving on to trade talks.

In case you have missed it,listen to the best 10 radio pieces of team radiowith our rundown here. Featuring Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, Esteban Ocon, Daniel Ricciardo plus much more. Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer at Yas Marina Valtteri Bottas held off team-mate Lewis Hamilton asMercedes cruised to a dominant one-twoin the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton, who won his fourth world championshiptwo races before the end of the season,appeared quicker in the second part of the race. But he could not get quite close enough to challenge for the lead in a drab andlargely action-free finale. Sebastian Vettelwas outclassed in third placeto underline the anti-climatic way in which Ferrari have ended a season that had for so long promised so much. Rob Smedley, who has been Felipe Massa's engineer throughout much of his career, tells Sky Sports:""It will be weird coming to a grand prix and him not being there. He is just someone to sit down with on a Friday night. It is like carrying your pint-sized mate around. ""We will see lots of each other. That won't change. He will carry on racing. It is in his blood. This is undoubtedly the right time to be retiring in Formula 1. He should have won race this year in Azerbaijan. Weekend in, weekend out, we rely on him. And on Williams' plan to replace the Brazilian, Smedley said:""The evaluation process is ongoing. We will be doing more this week. ""There is no reason to rush into it. We are the best remaining seat so we have that advantage that we can wait and evaluate every little bit."" Some quotes fromFelipe Massa,after his last ever Formula 1 race, said: ""It was really a great pleasure to be here for 16 years. The race was good today. ""I am so lucky to pass through all this racing in many great teams, fighting the best drivers in the world. Thank you for following me and supporting me all this time. I am very lucky to have this in my life. ""I will miss many things."" Lewis Hamilton, speaking to Sky Sports:""We can celebrate tonight but I don't fancy it too much. ""We have testing on Tuesday then I go to Malaysia and Germany and back to the UK. ""I will probably get some time off on the 18th and do some skiing, see the family and dogs.""

Force India team boss Otmar Szafnauer has told Sky Sports the penalty given to Nico Hulkenberg during the race ""makes a mockery of the sport"". Hulkenberg cut the corner when overtaking Force India's Sergio Perez and was given a five-second penalty rather than being forced to give the place back. That allowed Renault to go on and take the points they needed to climb into sixth in the constructors championship. ""They gain a place in the constructors championship which means more money for next year,"" Szafnauer said. ""Itmakes a mockery of the sport to have it so inconsistent."" Renault's Nico Hulkenberg after securing sixth place in the constructors championship, speaking to Sky Sports:""I knew I had a five second gap but when I realised the pit stop was taking longer I was getting a bit nervous. It turned out OK. ""I had to fight a little bit to get past the Haas but once that was done it was just a scenario of managing it.""

Armed police chief and deputy suspendedIt is understood Supt Kirk Kinnell and Chief Inspector Bob Glass are among six officers under investigation.2h2 hours agoScotland politics,"This video can not be played Michael Matheson confirmed the men were from the armed unit The head of armed policing and his deputy are understood to be among those suspended by Police Scotland amid allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended on Friday by the Scottish Police Authority. It is understood Supt Kirk Kinnell and his deputy, Chief Inspector Bob Glass, are among the other officers under investigation. One other officer has been suspended. A further two have been placed on restricted duties. Chief Inspector Glass was head of Strathclyde Police's armed response unit at the time of the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson confirmed to BBC Scotland thattwo officers named in a Sunday Mail story,,externalSupt Kinnell and Chief Inspector Glass, were under investigation. He told the Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""I think at this stage it wouldn't be appropriate for me to start mentioning names of those particular officers. ""But the two which I know have been suggested are individuals who were involved in the investigation. ""As far as I am aware, they are two of those who are part of the complaint that has been received by the Pirc (the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner) that is being investigated by the Crown Office. ""The individuals involved in this are related to those involved in the firearms unit at Police Scotland in the training facility that we have at Jackton."" ACC Bernard Higgins was suspended on Friday afternoon He added: ""I don't want to get drawn into it (what the allegations relate to) too much because it is a live investigation being directed by the Crown. But, as far as I'm aware, it relates to issues of misconduct and gross misconduct. ""The exact detail of that is for the Crown to determine because it is now a live, potentially criminal, investigation. ""Like any investigation that could be criminal in nature, it is important that we recognise there is due process to be gone through here. ""And also for the individuals who have the complaints lodged against them, (it is important) that we allow that process to take its course."" The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is also looking intoallegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley, who is currently on ""special leave"". That investigation is unrelated to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information. Both Mr Gormley and Mr Higgins have denied wrongdoing. A Crown Office spokesman said: ""We can confirm that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has instructed the Police Investigations & Review Commissioner (PIRC) to undertake an investigation into allegations of a criminal nature against officers serving with the Police Service of Scotland. ""A report will be submitted to COPFS following the investigation by PIRC."" Willie Rennie said the new SPA chief Susan Deacon should appear before MSPs The Scottish Police Authority confirmed the suspensions on Friday after ""a number of criminal and misconduct allegations were brought to the Authority's attention by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC)"". A spokesman for the SPA said on Sunday: ""The Authority will not provide any further detail in relation to the allegations."" The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie said Michael Matheson needed to address the issue at Holyrood. He said: ""The justice secretary needs to make a statement to Parliament to set out how leadership of Police Scotland will be secured while the months of investigation take place into senior officers. ""The public and all ranks of the police service deserve to hear the means by which effective force management will be provided.""

England on brink of crushing Ashes defeat,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Australia dominate plus day fourâs best TMS moments First Ashes Test, Gabba, Brisbane (day four of five) England 302 & 195:Root 51, Hazlewood 3-46, Starc 3-51, Lyon 3-67 Australia 328 & 114-0:Warner 60, Bancroft 51 Australia trail by 55 runs Scorecard England are on the verge of losing the first Ashes Test after Australia dominated the fourth day in Brisbane. Needing 170 to win, the home side require only 56 more on Monday, reaching the close on 114-0, with David Warner 60 not out and Cameron Bancroft unbeaten on 51. Such a modest target was the result of the good work of their bowlers, who dismissed England for 195. The tourists had opportunities to set Australia a more challenging chase, but Joe Root (51), Jonny Bairstow (42) and Moeen Ali (40) failed to make telling contributions following good starts. After Moeen was controversially stumped off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, England's tail was blown away by vicious fast bowling from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Then, any hope that the visitors could make Australia uncomfortable was withdrawn by Warner and Bancroft, who blunted the new ball and punished the bowling later in their innings to raise the chances of a four-day finish. They ran out of time, but on Monday Australia will go 1-0 up in their quest to regain the Ashes and preserve an unbeaten record at the Gabba that stretches back to 1988. Live coverage: Relive day four's wickets England must fix problems or Ashes will be gone - Agnew England need to score big hundreds - Moeen Podcast: Vaughan & Tuffers review the day This video can not be played Ashes: Joe Root out next ball after making half-century Australia's hold on an absorbing series opener only began to strengthen midway through the afternoon. Before then, like the previous three days, the even nature of the contest was gripping, except this particular instalment was played out in front of a much emptier Gabba. With Australia strangely reluctant to use the aggressive, short bowling that served them so well on a thrilling third evening, first Root, then Moeen and Bairstow looked to have the opportunity to bat England into a strong position. But whereas home captain Steve Smith ground out 141 not out on day three, England have had seven innings of 38 or more in the match, but no individual score above 83. And with the tourists lacking the pace to prevent Australia's tail from adding 119 runs for their last three wickets in the first innings, England's lower order have twice been blown away in a style reminiscent of the 5-0 defeat down under four years ago. James Anderson did at least take the new ball for England, allaying any fears that he was carrying an injury after he did little bowling on the third afternoon. Moeen Ali is stumped but was his foot behind the line? Moeen and Bairstow's partnership of 42 was a counter-attack, the sixth-wicket pair particularly pressurising Lyon, who had earlier frozen Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan. When Lyon turned an off-break past Moeen's forward defence, Tim Paine's lone appeal for a stumping looked innocuous but was still referred to the third umpire. After numerous close-up replays from different angles, Chris Gaffaney decided there was enough evidence to suggest Moeen had no part of his foot behind the crease line. If that was debatable, what seemed more controversial was the line itself. Repainted numerous times throughout the match, the part of the crease where Moeen was batting had become thicker, meaning he had to be further back to be in his ground and giving more leeway to the wicketkeeper. From there, Starc and Cummins took over as England lost their last five wickets for 40 runs, their last four for 10 and their last three for one. Chris Woakes fended a Starc short ball to second slip and Bairstow ramped the same bowler to third man. Broad, concerned about the bouncer, edged a Starc yorker behind and Ball could only flap a Cummins bumper to fly slip. After also losing their last six first-innings wickets for 56 runs, England's lower order can expect to be peppered for the rest of the series. Josh Hazlewood celebrates after taking the key wicket of Joe Root Apart from the charge that resulted in them taking England's last three wickets for just one run, Australia chipped away at, rather than dismantled the tourists. Root and Stoneman had done well to take England to 33-2, a lead of seven, on the third evening and they arrived on Sunday morning with a greater intent to score. Lyon, though, was excellent once more, finding turn and bounce to render both Stoneman and Malan shotless and having both left-handers caught at slip. Captain Root registered a busy half-century and seemed to be carrying his team's hopes, only to play across the line to Josh Hazlewood to be lbw for the second time in the match. When Australia's chase began after tea, there was the prospect that Warner would look to complete victory with a day to spare. But he and Bancroft were patient against the new-ball threat of Anderson and Broad, only opening their shoulders when England turned to the back-ups. Moeen was pummelled for almost six an over and had to be withdrawn, Woakes and Ball went at more than four an over. The Australia openers shared a century stand in their first Test together, Bancroft making a maiden half-century on his debut. It was only the returns of Anderson and Broad that prevented Australia from claiming the extra half an hour and ensured the game would reach a fifth day. England's Barmy Army fans tried to lift their side Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special: Can England see the positives and do better in the next Test? Do I see this England line-up getting 400? No, I don't. If England can only get 302 on this pitch - it will get difficult on quicker pitches. The art of playing at this level is understanding that you can't allow bowlers to bowl - it's a learning curve for Stoneman and Malan. I can see the tail being blown away every time. The top seven of the order will have to get big scores. I also look at England's bowling attack - where are the 20 wickets going to come from? However, last time here it was ugly, but this time they competed. Stuart Broad unsuccessfully appeals for a wicket as Australia's openers made a confident start Former England spinner Phil Tufnell on Test Match Special: It's not despair. I've played in a few Test matches where it has been that. You have to dust yourselves down and get ready to go again. Cook and Root will have to lead that being the experienced batsmen. I am little bit disappointed with Ball, Woakes and Moeen Ali. Broad and Anderson look like the only bowlers who will get wickets. Third umpire Chris Gaffaney confirmed Moeen's dismissal after several replays England all-rounder Moeen Ali:""We're very disappointed. Over the first three days we played well, but today we let ourselves down with the bat especially. A few players got in and never really got the big score that we needed. ""Regarding my wicket, you have to respect the umpires. One angle it looked out and another angle it looked not out. If I was bowling I'd want it out. ""I ripped my finger in the first innings after 15 overs. In the first innings I couldn't grip the ball that much, today was better but I was rubbish. ""To have no wickets today was disappointing."" Mitchell Starc took three wickets as Australia's pace bowlers impressed again Australia pace bowler Mitchell Starc:""It's a great day for the team. To finish none down with 65 to go, that's a great feeling. ""The first Test is huge in the course of any series. If we can knock them off tomorrow, we're in a strong position heading to Adelaide. They have to chase us. There's a lot of cricket to be played but it's a great spot for us to be in. ""We have our plans to all their batters. We've spoken about their tail. The way that our boys bowled at them in the last home Ashes, we used that as a blueprint. They can expect more short stuff as the series goes on."" This was the first time Moeen Ali had been stumped in international cricket. This would be Australia's second-highest successful Ashes chase at the Gabba (target of 188 achieved in 1982-83). James Anderson's bowling average in the fourth innings v Australia is only 65.57. David Warner played attacking shots to 36.0% of the deliveries he faced; Cameron Bancroft attacked 6.7% of the time.

Missing submarine 'was safe to sail'The Argentinean navy insists the vessel was in good condition before setting off 10 days ago.11h11 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Hundreds rallied at the submarine's naval base on Saturday to support relatives of the missing crew The Argentine navy has insisted a missing submarine was in good condition and had passed system safety checks before setting off on a training mission 10 days ago. Some relatives of the 44 missing crew members had suggested the 34-year-old vessel was in a bad state of repair. The ARA San Juan last made contact with naval authorities on 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors are fading despite international search efforts involving several countries. ""We are at a stage of hope and hopelessness at the same time,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said. ""We have to be guided by firm evidence. We are focused on detecting the submarine."" Enrique Balbi: ""If it set off from Ushuaia, it was because it was in condition to do so"" Mr Balbi told a news conference that the submarine had its whole operating system checked two days before setting sail. ""The submarine doesn't sail if that's not done. If it set off... it was because it was in condition to do so,"" he said. Relatives gathered at the submarine's naval base on Saturday to take part in a religious ceremony and were joined by hundreds of supporters. Some have reportedly begun mourning their loved ones, fearing it is too late for them to be found alive. On Fridaythe country's president said an inquiry would be launched to find out the ""truth""after a week of uncertainty and speculation. The submarine was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". A naval commander said the submarine had surfaced and reported the breakdown, described as a ""short circuit"" in its batteries. The navy said it then made further contact to say the problem had been fixed and the submarine would proceed toward its port. What happens when a submarine goes missing Media share sub families' grief and anger On Thursday, the authorities said an event consistent with an explosion had been detected by a nuclear test watchdog. The Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) said an ""abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event"" was recorded in the South Atlantic. The US also reported a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" hours after the submarine went missing, close to its last known location. The news dashed hopes among relatives, although no wreckage or debris has been found by the international search teams. On Saturday a military spokesman said the submarine was not carrying torpedoes on board, dismissing a theory there had been an accident with explosives it was carrying. Russia suffered the loss of its Kursk submarine in a disaster in 2000, when all 118 on board died On Saturday Russia joined the operation, deploying one of its largest aircraft on Friday night with specialist equipment on board. Its unmanned submersible, known as the Pantera Plus, can conduct sonar scans up to a depth of 1,000m (3,281ft). Russia also has a scientific exploration ship on the way from West Africa. The US Navy also deployed unmanned ""mini-sub"" vehicles to join the search. The UK, Brazil, Chile, Norway, Germany, Canada, France, Peru, Colombia and Uruguay are also helping to try to locate the vessel. The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman There are 44 crew members on board, under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Reports suggest one crew member escaped the tragedy because he was off the vessel visiting his sick mother, and had been replaced by someone else. This video can not be played Families of the crew say relatives aren't being told anything On Saturday relatives held a religious vigil service outside of the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was based. They have expressed frustration with authorities, who they say have been slow at sharing information about search efforts..

Archbishop ends 10-year Mugabe protest,"This video can not be played The Archbishop of York put his dog collar back on during the show The Archbishop of York has put on a dog collar for the first time in almost 10 years, ending his symbolic protest over Robert Mugabe's leadership of Zimbabwe. In December 2007,Dr John Sentamu cut up his dog collar,externallive on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, promising not to wear one until Mr Mugabe left office. He said Zimbabwe's leader had ""taken people's identity"" and ""cut it to pieces"", prompting him to do the same. On Sunday, he returned to the Marr Show and reinstated his collar as promised. Mr Mugabeleft office dramaticallyon Tuesday after 37 years of authoritarian rule. Dr Sentamu said: ""Normally I [would] tie the top button and put on my collar, but for nearly 10 years I haven't be able to. It has meant every morning I think of the people of Zimbabwe."" After Andrew Marr presented him with an envelope containing the cut up pieces of his collar, Dr Sentamu said: ""You've been a very faithful friend, you've kept them - that's lovely. ""I could attempt to put this one back together using superglue, but it would be a pretty ropey collar. And I actually think the message for Zimbabwe is the same. They just can't try and stitch it up. Something more radical, something new needs to happen."" Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? He said Mr Mugabe may have gone, but the new President Emmerson Mnangagwa - who wassworn in on Friday- was ""still implicated in a lot of things"". Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa ""can't bury the past"", said Dr Sentamu Dr Sentamu added: ""It's quite possible that Mnangagwa could be a very, very good president. But he can't simply bury the past - it won't go away."" He also said it could be possible for Zimbabweans to forgive Mr Mugabe. ""Mugabe needs to say at some point to Zimbabweans: 'Forgive me'.

Policeman hurt in 'despicable' van attackThe officer suffered serious injuries when a Transit van was driven at him in Liverpool.7m8 minutes agoLiverpool,"Officers tried to stop a white van on Hasfield Road in Norris Green A police officer was seriously injured when he was hit by a van driven at him in Liverpool. Police were trying to stop a white Transit van in Norris Green when it was driven onto the pavement and then at the officer at 19:25 GMT on Saturday. The officer was taken to hospital following the ""despicable attack"" where he is being treated for injuries to his ribs and leg, Merseyside Police said. A man, from Everton, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The 34-year-old, who is also being held on possession of cannabis and driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, remains in custody. The van hit a police car and other parked vehicles on Hasfield Road before it was driven at the officer, detectives said. The policeman's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening Det Ch Insp Martin Earl said: ""This was a despicable attack on a police officer who was simply doing his job, trying to protect the communities of Merseyside. ""The officer has sustained serious injuries for which he is receiving treatment. He has also been left extremely shaken by his ordeal."" He added that colleagues have been left ""shocked"" by the incident and are being provided with support. Peter Singleton, chair of the Merseyside branch of the Police Federation - which represents 120,000 officers across the UK - said it was ""another sobering reminder of how dangerous policing can be"". ""It's an incident that shows there are individuals out there who really just do not care, have no thoughts for other people - for the public or police officers - and their safety,"" he said. He added it was an ""unnerving reminder"" of the death of Merseyside Police officerDave Phillips, who was killed while trying to stop a stolen vehicle in 2015.

Sailors perform Changing the GuardThe Royal Navy is taking part in the ceremony at Buckingham Palace for the first time.8m9 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played It is the first time sailors have ever performed the ceremony Royal Navy sailors have performed the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace for the first time in the ceremony's 357-year history. Eighty-six sailors from 45 Royal Navy ships and establishments spent a month preparing ahead of the first ceremony on Sunday morning. Warrant Officer Eddie Wearing said it was a ""massive privilege"". The ceremony is usually carried out by one of the five Foot Guards Regiments from the Army's Household Division. Eighty-six sailors from 45 Royal Navy ships and establishments spent a month preparing The sailors marched to the Game of Thrones theme tune as crowds gathered around the palace gates to watch. Second Sea Lord Vice Admiral Jonathan Woodcocktweeted,externalthat watching the event was a ""highly emotional moment"" and he was ""so proud"" of the Royal Navy. The sailors marched to the Game of Thrones theme tune The Royal Navy has been training for a month for the historic occasion The change in personnel is to mark 2017 as the ""Year of the Navy,external"", which former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon called ""the start of a new era of maritime power"". Changing the Guard can be traced back to King Henry VII, when a royal bodyguard was first created. It is the ceremony where one set of guards - the Old Guard - hands over the responsibility of protecting Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace to another set of guards - the New Guard. The Old Guard march from the forecourt of Buckingham Palace at 11:00 GMT, accompanied by a regimental band. The New Guard then march, again with a band, from Wellington Barracks to take over. It draws many tourists, taking place every other day during the winter months and every day over the summer. The ceremony itself has been taking place since the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. The sailors have been training at the Royal Navy's headquarters in Portsmouth. Lt Cdr Steve Elliott, 44, from Portsmouth, will be Captain of the Queen's Guard - believed to be the first in the Royal Navy since Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587. ""As we march out of Wellington Barracks for the first time, I'm fairly sure everyone will grow a good eight to 10 inches,"" said Lt Cdr Elliott earlier. ""It's great to do this ceremonial piece and have the Royal Navy back in the public eye, as well as to act as a capstone to the year of the Royal Navy. We couldn't ask for anything better."" The sailors will also be performing Royal Duties at St James's Palace, Windsor Castle and the Tower of London.

"Heathrow worker charged over drugs findFarhan Iqbal was arrested at Terminal 5 after cocaine with a street value of Â£700,000 was seized.12h12 hours agoLondon","A Heathrow security worker has been charged with conspiring to import drugs after cocaine with a street value of Â£700,000 was seized. Farhan Iqbal, 30, was arrested alongside Colombian national, Camilo Alec Pulido Suarez, 37, in a toilet at Terminal 5 on Thursday. Both were charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and appeared earlier at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court. They were remanded in custody along with two other Colombian nationals. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Wilmer Salazar-Duarte, 43, was separately arrested in the arrivals area of the airport, while 46-year-old Alexander Salazar-Duarte, was arrested after a search at an address in east London.

Irish border: Is all as it seems?,"Sometimes in politics people see conspiracies where none exist. But when it comes to tough political negotiations, both sides may from time to time indulge in a little bit of conspiracy theory which, becomes on occasion, perhaps a bit of paranoia here and there which could reveal some of your opponents' tactics. There may be nothing in it, but just in case, well, you've thought through what might be the true extent of your rivals' plotting. And as you know every now and then it is worth exploring one or two of those conspiracy theories that circulate in SW1. DUP's Foster warns Irish PM over Brexit So, bear with me. While there are genuine and sincerely held logistical and understandable concerns about what happens to the Irish border after Brexit, there is a sense building that perhaps the Irish government is playing those concerns rather harder than is justified. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster,using rather strong language, told off the Irish leader Leo Varadkar for doing just that today. But the next step in what many would say is a conspiracy theory, borne out of Brexiteer desperation, is to ponder whether the EU as a whole is over-egging their true level of worry about what happens to the border. The issue has in fact, so the theory goes, become the perfect ""anti-UK"" issue that can be waved around in the talks every now and then. Of course not a single soul involved would want Northern Ireland to go back to the era when there was a hard border for very different reasons than those that are pondered today. So again, so the theory goes, it is politically awkward to shout down those who are outlining concerns. But according to these arguments, the border issue could be exploited by the EU side so they can later drop their concerns as a public concession to the UK, in return for a genuine concession from the British side. There are whispers too that the previous government in Ireland had been discussing some potential solutions to the problem but after the change in political circumstances those conversations came to an end. Wonder why? No one on any side of the talks at the moment would concede or publicly acknowledge any of the kinds of tactics outlined above. An excellent and very different account of how pressure has been building on this issue has been written byone of my counterparts, the excellent Tony Connolly at RTE,external. But in any negotiation both sides are looking for leverage. And in something as tense as this deal-making process, both sides' positions are not exactly as they outwardly appear.

Six things to watch about Brexit,"We're now halfway between the Brexit referendum and the day the UK is supposed to leave the EU, and the entire process seems to be clouded in confusion. Don't take my word for it. I've spent the last three weeks talking to a variety of people, from Irish thoroughbred breeders to chief executives of construction companies, from nuclear scientists to taxi drivers. And everyone wants to know where on earth all this is heading. I've seen it argued that Leavers and Remainers find it difficult to have a constructive debate because the Leave side tend to focus on broad political themes (Take Back Control, anyone?) while the Remain side focus on the detail. On 29 March 2017, European Council President Donald Tusk received the letter which triggered the UK's withdrawal from the EU That's why some advocates of Remain still have difficulty accepting the fact that a big political decision was made in the referendum. At the same time a government that has committed itself to Brexit, but is divided about what that actually means, is trying to master the detail in record time. And if there's one thing about Brexit that does become clearer every week, it is that this is a process of unprecedented complexity. Like unstitching a blanket, or unbaking a cake: you can choose your own simile, but the inference is clear. No advanced industrial economy has ever tried to do anything quite like this before - extricating itself in an astonishingly short space of time from more than 40 years of shared sovereignty and close economic co-ordination with its nearest neighbours.. No wonder we're still a wee bit perplexed.Explaining Brexit is a bit like stapling jelly. But here, slightly at random and in no particular order, are a few things that emerged from our series, which may be worth keeping an eye on. If a deal is to emerge soon on the issue of citizens' rights (for EU citizens here in the UK in particular) then the notion of ""direct effect"" is likely to loom large. It is a really important principle of the European Court of Justice, because it means individuals can invoke European law before national courts. In this case, the Brexit withdrawal agreement (with European law enshrined within it) could be written directly into UK law rather than relying on a separate piece of UK legislation to implement it. The EU thought that the UK had conceded this point; if that turns out not to be so, it will cause problems. Theresa May met Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Downing Street in September 2017 It's not just about the border, and the effect on Northern Ireland, critically important though that is. A total of 80% of Irish exports go to or through the UK, which is also critical for Irish energy supplies, and no other country outside the UK has nearly as much at stake in the Brexit debate as the Republic of Ireland. ""There is hardly any area of Irish life that won't be affected in one way or another,"" says Tony Connelly, author of the book Brexit and Ireland. That means Dublin needs a good deal with the UK after Brexit. But it doesn't mean Ireland won't play tough. In the Brexit negotiations it is sticking with the mantra of the unity of the EU27, and exasperation with UK politics is mounting. Anna Wallace, the director of political relations at the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, told the story of a manufacturing company in Wales that has decided to replace EU migrant workers with machines, rather than with a locally hired workforce. ""They knew they were probably going to do that in five years' time,"" she says. ""But good businesses are now thinking about all of those things together."" It is a reminder that Brexit is only one part of a much larger economic debate, as another technological revolution looms large. Automation would be changing the working lives of many people come what may (in fact, it already is). But the effect of Brexit will probably speed up things. The good thing about change? It always brings opportunity as well as risk. The end of the free movement of people from the EU could well lead to some liberalisation of UK immigration policy for the rest of the world. That may not come as a surprise to many economists who deal with immigration issues, but it may not have been what many Leave supporters thought they were voting for. The UK will still need immigrant labour to keep its economy moving. Even the pressure group Migration Watch advocates the creation of new schemes for seasonal agricultural workers from the EU, and for young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to work in the UK for up to two years. But immigration policy isn't just about the UK choosing whom it wants. They have to want to come to the UK too. The rest of the world beyond Europe may have to fill some gaps in the market. The Joint European Torus in Oxfordshire can lay convincing claim to be the greatest scientific experiment in the UK. The long-term aim is to produce an unlimited supply of clean energy through nuclear fusion. But Jet is run under the auspices of Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community. And alongside the EU, we're leaving Euratom too. The trouble is that funding for Jet runs out at the end of 2018. And until we know the future relationship between Euratom and the UK after Brexit, no one can say for certain that funding will be extended. Surely, you cry, they won't just pull the giant Torus plug? ""I work in fusion research so by definition I think I'm an optimist,"" says Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. ""But everybody is anxious, and everybody wants a resolution to this as quickly as possible."" You probably know this one already, but it is worth repeating. When it comes to Brexit, no one has any idea what is going to happen next. ""I've been following British politics professionally for almost 50 years,"" says the pollster Peter Kellner. ""Never before have I been so uncertain as to where British politics has been heading. ""We're looking at a mountain ahead of us shrouded in fog. We can't see the pass and we don't know what's on the other side."" The battle for Brexit seems to have been around forever, but it may be that the critical phase is only just beginning. Stay tuned.

Deadly blast rocks Chinese city,"This video can not be played The Chinese city of Ningbo is rocked by a deadly blast At least two people have been killed and dozens more injured in an explosion in the eastern Chinese port city of Ningbo, local officials say. The blast is said to have occurred at a factory at about 09:00 (01:00 GMT) in the city's Jiangbei District, causing some nearby buildings to collapse. State media reported that at least 30 people had been taken to local hospitals amid rescue operations. Footage showed rescuers carrying people away from an area surrounded by debris. Industrial accidents are common in China, and have prompted growing calls for better safety standards. The government says it has been tightening site inspections and toughening punishments for safety lapses. But while the number of workplace deaths in 2017 is reported to have fallen by more than 25% on 2016 - industrial fatalities still number at least 29,000 in the year to date. Pictures from the scene showed the power of the blast, which destroyed cars and buildings Police said on social media that an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the latest explosion. Ningbo has a large international shipping port and is best known for its auto-manufacturing industry, it is home to Geely - the Chinese owner of Volvo. Chinese media said the explosion happened in an industrial area, and residential buildings damaged nearby were already empty ahead of planned demolition. Some local reports suggested gas canisters could have been to blame for the blast. Shattered windows were reported in businesses up to 1km away from the site of the explosion itself.

Pakistan calls army over 'blasphemy' clashSecurity forces came under a hail of stones from Islamist protesters calling for a minister's sacking.9h9 hours agoAsia,"This video can not be played Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters Pakistan's government has called for troops to be deployed in the capital, Islamabad, after violence broke out during protests by Islamists. About 200 people were injured when security forces tried to disperse an Islamist sit-in at the Faizabad Interchange - a key highway. Several deaths have been reported. The protesters have been blocking the highway for several weeks, demanding the sacking of Law Minister Zahid Hamid whom they accuse of blasphemy. Pakistani media report that demonstrators also broke into the minister's residence in Punjab province. Mr Hamid and his family were not in the building. The protests have spread to other cities, including Lahore and the southern port of Karachi. About 200 people were injured in Saturday's clashes The Pakistani government asked the army to deploy in Islamabad on Saturday evening. The interior minister said the order was issued at the request of the city authorities, who were not able to clear the sit-in. There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. Protesters want Pakistan's law minister to be sacked Earlier on Saturday, security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse the demonstrators, Pakistani media report, but were met with rocks and tear gas shells. About 8,500 elite police and paramilitary forces took part in the operation to clear the Faizabad Interchange. The crackdown was later suspended. Protesters said four of their activists were killed, but police said there were no deaths, Reuters reports. However, officials are quoted in other reports confirming that several people were killed. Many of those injured are security personnel. The request for the military deployment came after hundreds more demonstrators turned up unexpectedly, forcing the police to retreat. At one point, the authorities took all private television news channels off air, apparently out of concern that the live coverage of the police action could inflame religious sentiments. The protesting Islamists, from the hardline Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah Party, want the law minister to be sacked for omitting a reference to the Prophet Muhammad in a new version of the electoral oath. The minister has since apologised saying it was a clerical error.

England on brink of crushing Ashes defeatEngland are on the verge of losing the first Ashes Test after Australia dominate the fourth day in Brisbane.,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Australia dominate plus day fourâs best TMS moments First Ashes Test, Gabba, Brisbane (day four of five) England 302 & 195:Root 51, Hazlewood 3-46, Starc 3-51, Lyon 3-67 Australia 328 & 114-0:Warner 60, Bancroft 51 Australia trail by 55 runs Scorecard England are on the verge of losing the first Ashes Test after Australia dominated the fourth day in Brisbane. Needing 170 to win, the home side require only 56 more on Monday, reaching the close on 114-0, with David Warner 60 not out and Cameron Bancroft unbeaten on 51. Such a modest target was the result of the good work of their bowlers, who dismissed England for 195. The tourists had opportunities to set Australia a more challenging chase, but Joe Root (51), Jonny Bairstow (42) and Moeen Ali (40) failed to make telling contributions following good starts. After Moeen was controversially stumped off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, England's tail was blown away by vicious fast bowling from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Then, any hope that the visitors could make Australia uncomfortable was withdrawn by Warner and Bancroft, who blunted the new ball and punished the bowling later in their innings to raise the chances of a four-day finish. They ran out of time, but on Monday Australia will go 1-0 up in their quest to regain the Ashes and preserve an unbeaten record at the Gabba that stretches back to 1988. Live coverage: Relive day four's wickets England must fix problems or Ashes will be gone - Agnew England need to score big hundreds - Moeen Podcast: Vaughan & Tuffers review the day This video can not be played Ashes: Joe Root out next ball after making half-century Australia's hold on an absorbing series opener only began to strengthen midway through the afternoon. Before then, like the previous three days, the even nature of the contest was gripping, except this particular instalment was played out in front of a much emptier Gabba. With Australia strangely reluctant to use the aggressive, short bowling that served them so well on a thrilling third evening, first Root, then Moeen and Bairstow looked to have the opportunity to bat England into a strong position. But whereas home captain Steve Smith ground out 141 not out on day three, England have had seven innings of 38 or more in the match, but no individual score above 83. And with the tourists lacking the pace to prevent Australia's tail from adding 119 runs for their last three wickets in the first innings, England's lower order have twice been blown away in a style reminiscent of the 5-0 defeat down under four years ago. James Anderson did at least take the new ball for England, allaying any fears that he was carrying an injury after he did little bowling on the third afternoon. Moeen Ali is stumped but was his foot behind the line? Moeen and Bairstow's partnership of 42 was a counter-attack, the sixth-wicket pair particularly pressurising Lyon, who had earlier frozen Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan. When Lyon turned an off-break past Moeen's forward defence, Tim Paine's lone appeal for a stumping looked innocuous but was still referred to the third umpire. After numerous close-up replays from different angles, Chris Gaffaney decided there was enough evidence to suggest Moeen had no part of his foot behind the crease line. If that was debatable, what seemed more controversial was the line itself. Repainted numerous times throughout the match, the part of the crease where Moeen was batting had become thicker, meaning he had to be further back to be in his ground and giving more leeway to the wicketkeeper. From there, Starc and Cummins took over as England lost their last five wickets for 40 runs, their last four for 10 and their last three for one. Chris Woakes fended a Starc short ball to second slip and Bairstow ramped the same bowler to third man. Broad, concerned about the bouncer, edged a Starc yorker behind and Ball could only flap a Cummins bumper to fly slip. After also losing their last six first-innings wickets for 56 runs, England's lower order can expect to be peppered for the rest of the series. Josh Hazlewood celebrates after taking the key wicket of Joe Root Apart from the charge that resulted in them taking England's last three wickets for just one run, Australia chipped away at, rather than dismantled the tourists. Root and Stoneman had done well to take England to 33-2, a lead of seven, on the third evening and they arrived on Sunday morning with a greater intent to score. Lyon, though, was excellent once more, finding turn and bounce to render both Stoneman and Malan shotless and having both left-handers caught at slip. Captain Root registered a busy half-century and seemed to be carrying his team's hopes, only to play across the line to Josh Hazlewood to be lbw for the second time in the match. When Australia's chase began after tea, there was the prospect that Warner would look to complete victory with a day to spare. But he and Bancroft were patient against the new-ball threat of Anderson and Broad, only opening their shoulders when England turned to the back-ups. Moeen was pummelled for almost six an over and had to be withdrawn, Woakes and Ball went at more than four an over. The Australia openers shared a century stand in their first Test together, Bancroft making a maiden half-century on his debut. It was only the returns of Anderson and Broad that prevented Australia from claiming the extra half an hour and ensured the game would reach a fifth day. England's Barmy Army fans tried to lift their side Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special: Can England see the positives and do better in the next Test? Do I see this England line-up getting 400? No, I don't. If England can only get 302 on this pitch - it will get difficult on quicker pitches. The art of playing at this level is understanding that you can't allow bowlers to bowl - it's a learning curve for Stoneman and Malan. I can see the tail being blown away every time. The top seven of the order will have to get big scores. I also look at England's bowling attack - where are the 20 wickets going to come from? However, last time here it was ugly, but this time they competed. Stuart Broad unsuccessfully appeals for a wicket as Australia's openers made a confident start Former England spinner Phil Tufnell on Test Match Special: It's not despair. I've played in a few Test matches where it has been that. You have to dust yourselves down and get ready to go again. Cook and Root will have to lead that being the experienced batsmen. I am little bit disappointed with Ball, Woakes and Moeen Ali. Broad and Anderson look like the only bowlers who will get wickets. Third umpire Chris Gaffaney confirmed Moeen's dismissal after several replays England all-rounder Moeen Ali:""We're very disappointed. Over the first three days we played well, but today we let ourselves down with the bat especially. A few players got in and never really got the big score that we needed. ""Regarding my wicket, you have to respect the umpires. One angle it looked out and another angle it looked not out. If I was bowling I'd want it out. ""I ripped my finger in the first innings after 15 overs. In the first innings I couldn't grip the ball that much, today was better but I was rubbish. ""To have no wickets today was disappointing."" Mitchell Starc took three wickets as Australia's pace bowlers impressed again Australia pace bowler Mitchell Starc:""It's a great day for the team. To finish none down with 65 to go, that's a great feeling. ""The first Test is huge in the course of any series. If we can knock them off tomorrow, we're in a strong position heading to Adelaide. They have to chase us. There's a lot of cricket to be played but it's a great spot for us to be in. ""We have our plans to all their batters. We've spoken about their tail. The way that our boys bowled at them in the last home Ashes, we used that as a blueprint. They can expect more short stuff as the series goes on."" This was the first time Moeen Ali had been stumped in international cricket. This would be Australia's second-highest successful Ashes chase at the Gabba (target of 188 achieved in 1982-83). James Anderson's bowling average in the fourth innings v Australia is only 65.57. David Warner played attacking shots to 36.0% of the deliveries he faced; Cameron Bancroft attacked 6.7% of the time.

"UK drone users to sit safety testsA draft bill proposes a number of new requirements for drone owners, while tackling illegal use.3h3 hours agoUK","Drone users in the UK may have to take safety awareness tests under legislation planned by the government. Drones weighing more than 250g could also be banned from flying near airports, or above 400 ft, in a crackdown on unsafe flying. Police will also be given new powers to seize and ground drones which may have been used in criminal activity. The bill has been welcomed by the pilots' union, which has warned of near misses involving drones and aircraft. Balpa said there had been 81 incidents so far this year - up from 71 in 2016 and 29 in 2015. The union's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""These proposals are a step towards the safe integration of drones, but until the new rules are in place the threat of a serious collision remains."" In July a drone flew directly over the wing of a large passenger jet as it came into land at London's Gatwick Airport,which a report said had put 130 lives at risk. Drones scatter mosquitoes to fight diseases The flying drones that can scan packages night and day Drone detects heartbeat and breathing rates The proposed bill - to be published in spring 2018 - would ensure that owners of drones weighing more than 250g would need to register and sit a test. Drone pilot and trainer Elliott Corke, director of The Aerial Academy, said most recreationally and commercially-used drones in use weighed more than 250g, apart from the cheap toy versions. He told BBC News that many new users were surprised by how many rules around drone usage already exist, under the Civil Aviation Authority'sDrone Code,external. He said there was a ""degree of frustration"" however that the rules were not being enforced effectively, allowing criminal activity to take place. This video can not be played Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners Serena Kennedy, Assistant Chief Constable of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), told BBC Breakfast: ""At the moment we're using other bits of legislation - the Civil Aviation Authority's - to enable us to take action. ""This draft legislation will give us the powers we need to tackle drones when they are being used for criminal purposes."" She said it would help police tackle the ""increasing problem"" of drones delivering items, such as drugs and mobile phones, to prisons. She said the legislation could allow police to look at how they can protect prison establishments from criminal drone activity through geo-fencing, which programmes no-fly zones into drones using GPS co-ordinates. This video can not be played Drones should be flown no higher than 400ft Christian Struwe, head of European public policy at drone maker DJI, warned that some of the proposals may be ""difficult to police"" - for example the height restriction. But he told BBC Breakfast: ""The good thing is that as an industry we are already working on it. We can limit how high they can fly."" Mr Struwe pointed out that there was no ""hard limit"" on how close drones could fly to airports. ""The current wording is that you should stay well clear,"" he said. He welcomed the proposals to limit the ""bad use"" of drones, adding that it was important people were aware there was regulation they needed to follow. Mr Corke agreed that there was a ""lack of awareness"" of the Drone Code, and said he was frustrated by the lack of focus on practical training. ""Most people don't read the manual or learn the safety features before they use their drones"", he said, adding that many did not know what to do if something malfunctioned. Alongside the new laws, the government is also keen to develop technology allowing the greater use of drones for tasks including deliveries of everything from shopping to human organs. The transport minster, Lady Sugg, said the government wanted to strike the right balance between harnessing drone potential and ensuring they are not misused. ""We're bringing forward this legislation in order to ensure that drones can be used safely, whilst also addressing some of the safety and privacy concerns that people have,"" she said. The government is also working with drone manufacturers on technology which produces virtual barriers, to stop the machines operating in restricted areas. Drones to spot new Ystalyfera landslips.

Airlines warned over Bali volcano activity,"This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows ash rising into the sky, disrupting flights Airlines have been issued a ""red warning"" about the danger of volcanic ash in the skies close to Bali after Mount Agung emitted a thick plume of smoke reaching 4,000m (13,100 feet). It is the second major emission from the Indonesian island volcano this week, and flights have been disrupted. The red warning means an eruption is forecast to be imminent,external, with significant emission of ash likely. Authorities have begun distributing masks in some areas as ash falls. Bali is a major tourist destination, although the main resorts of Kuta and Seminyak are about 70km (43 miles) from the volcano. The island's main airport is for now operating normally, but some airlines have cancelled flights. Volcanic ash can damage plane engines. Travellers to and from the region are being urged tocontact their airline or travel agent,externalto find out the status of their flight. Ash from the eruption coated roads, cars and buildings near the volcano in the north-east of Bali and emergency officials said hundreds of thousands of masks had been distributed The ash cloud is said to be moving eastward from Bali towards the island of Lombok, and the main international airport there has been closed entirely. The information director of Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency tweeted that volcanic ash rain had fallen on the Lombok city of Mataram. Bali volcano: What is it like waiting for an eruption? Indonesia: Volcano nation ""Tourism in Bali is still safe, except in the danger (zone) around Mount Agung,"" the agency said in a statement. It told people within a 7.5km exclusion zone to ""immediately evacuate"" in an ""orderly and calm manner"". Magma - molten rock - has now been detected close to the volcano's surface, said officials and volcanologists. Passengers waiting at Bali's Ngurah Rai airport on Saturday About 25,000 people are thought to still be in temporary shelters after more than 140,000 people fled earlier this year. Increased volcanic activity had prompted fears a major eruption was imminent. Most of the islanders outside the immediate exclusion zone were ordered to return home at the end of September,and the mountain has been intermittently rumbling since. This video can not be played Evacuees from near Mount Agung brought their birds, chickens and dogs with them in September According to official estimates, the holiday island lost at least $110m (Â£83m) in tourism and productivity during the major evacuation.

Large explosion reported in Chinese city,"This video can not be played The Chinese city of Ningbo is rocked by a deadly blast At least two people have been killed and dozens more injured in an explosion in the eastern Chinese port city of Ningbo, local officials say. The blast is said to have occurred at a factory at about 09:00 (01:00 GMT) in the city's Jiangbei District, causing some nearby buildings to collapse. State media reported that at least 30 people had been taken to local hospitals amid rescue operations. Footage showed rescuers carrying people away from an area surrounded by debris. Industrial accidents are common in China, and have prompted growing calls for better safety standards. The government says it has been tightening site inspections and toughening punishments for safety lapses. But while the number of workplace deaths in 2017 is reported to have fallen by more than 25% on 2016 - industrial fatalities still number at least 29,000 in the year to date. Pictures from the scene showed the power of the blast, which destroyed cars and buildings Police said on social media that an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the latest explosion. Ningbo has a large international shipping port and is best known for its auto-manufacturing industry, it is home to Geely - the Chinese owner of Volvo. Chinese media said the explosion happened in an industrial area, and residential buildings damaged nearby were already empty ahead of planned demolition. Some local reports suggested gas canisters could have been to blame for the blast. Shattered windows were reported in businesses up to 1km away from the site of the explosion itself.

Sailors to perform Changing the Guard,"This video can not be played It is the first time sailors have ever performed the ceremony Royal Navy sailors have performed the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace for the first time in the ceremony's 357-year history. Eighty-six sailors from 45 Royal Navy ships and establishments spent a month preparing ahead of the first ceremony on Sunday morning. Warrant Officer Eddie Wearing said it was a ""massive privilege"". The ceremony is usually carried out by one of the five Foot Guards Regiments from the Army's Household Division. Eighty-six sailors from 45 Royal Navy ships and establishments spent a month preparing The sailors marched to the Game of Thrones theme tune as crowds gathered around the palace gates to watch. Second Sea Lord Vice Admiral Jonathan Woodcocktweeted,externalthat watching the event was a ""highly emotional moment"" and he was ""so proud"" of the Royal Navy. The sailors marched to the Game of Thrones theme tune The Royal Navy has been training for a month for the historic occasion The change in personnel is to mark 2017 as the ""Year of the Navy,external"", which former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon called ""the start of a new era of maritime power"". Changing the Guard can be traced back to King Henry VII, when a royal bodyguard was first created. It is the ceremony where one set of guards - the Old Guard - hands over the responsibility of protecting Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace to another set of guards - the New Guard. The Old Guard march from the forecourt of Buckingham Palace at 11:00 GMT, accompanied by a regimental band. The New Guard then march, again with a band, from Wellington Barracks to take over. It draws many tourists, taking place every other day during the winter months and every day over the summer. The ceremony itself has been taking place since the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. The sailors have been training at the Royal Navy's headquarters in Portsmouth. Lt Cdr Steve Elliott, 44, from Portsmouth, will be Captain of the Queen's Guard - believed to be the first in the Royal Navy since Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587. ""As we march out of Wellington Barracks for the first time, I'm fairly sure everyone will grow a good eight to 10 inches,"" said Lt Cdr Elliott earlier. ""It's great to do this ceremonial piece and have the Royal Navy back in the public eye, as well as to act as a capstone to the year of the Royal Navy. We couldn't ask for anything better."" The sailors will also be performing Royal Duties at St James's Palace, Windsor Castle and the Tower of London.

Missing submarine 'was safe to sail'The Argentinean navy insists the vessel was in good condition before setting off 10 days ago.4h4 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Hundreds rallied at the submarine's naval base on Saturday to support relatives of the missing crew The Argentine navy has insisted a missing submarine was in good condition and had passed system safety checks before setting off on a training mission 10 days ago. Some relatives of the 44 missing crew members had suggested the 34-year-old vessel was in a bad state of repair. The ARA San Juan last made contact with naval authorities on 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors are fading despite international search efforts involving several countries. ""We are at a stage of hope and hopelessness at the same time,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said. ""We have to be guided by firm evidence. We are focused on detecting the submarine."" Enrique Balbi: ""If it set off from Ushuaia, it was because it was in condition to do so"" Mr Balbi told a news conference that the submarine had its whole operating system checked two days before setting sail. ""The submarine doesn't sail if that's not done. If it set off... it was because it was in condition to do so,"" he said. Relatives gathered at the submarine's naval base on Saturday to take part in a religious ceremony and were joined by hundreds of supporters. Some have reportedly begun mourning their loved ones, fearing it is too late for them to be found alive. On Fridaythe country's president said an inquiry would be launched to find out the ""truth""after a week of uncertainty and speculation. The submarine was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". A naval commander said the submarine had surfaced and reported the breakdown, described as a ""short circuit"" in its batteries. The navy said it then made further contact to say the problem had been fixed and the submarine would proceed toward its port. What happens when a submarine goes missing Media share sub families' grief and anger On Thursday, the authorities said an event consistent with an explosion had been detected by a nuclear test watchdog. The Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) said an ""abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event"" was recorded in the South Atlantic. The US also reported a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" hours after the submarine went missing, close to its last known location. The news dashed hopes among relatives, although no wreckage or debris has been found by the international search teams. On Saturday a military spokesman said the submarine was not carrying torpedoes on board, dismissing a theory there had been an accident with explosives it was carrying. Russia suffered the loss of its Kursk submarine in a disaster in 2000, when all 118 on board died On Saturday Russia joined the operation, deploying one of its largest aircraft on Friday night with specialist equipment on board. Its unmanned submersible, known as the Pantera Plus, can conduct sonar scans up to a depth of 1,000m (3,281ft). Russia also has a scientific exploration ship on the way from West Africa. The US Navy also deployed unmanned ""mini-sub"" vehicles to join the search. The UK, Brazil, Chile, Norway, Germany, Canada, France, Peru, Colombia and Uruguay are also helping to try to locate the vessel. The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman There are 44 crew members on board, under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Reports suggest one crew member escaped the tragedy because he was off the vessel visiting his sick mother, and had been replaced by someone else. This video can not be played Families of the crew say relatives aren't being told anything On Saturday relatives held a religious vigil service outside of the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was based. They have expressed frustration with authorities, who they say have been slow at sharing information about search efforts..
