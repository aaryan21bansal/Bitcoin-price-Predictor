Mason: G7 leaders meet amid political pressures at home,"Amid the beauty of the Bavarian mountains and fields, a fundamental truth is immediately striking at this G7 Summit. When a collection of democracies gather, each national leader is flexing to the political and public mood back home, subtly, sometimes strikingly different from one country to the next. The G7 has an opponent in Russia, whose leader faces no such democratic pressure, and is acutely savvy about the weaknesses, as he might see them, of the western model of governance. Amid the security and the choreography, the grip and grin photo ops and the alpine backdrops, the differences of emphasis between the G7 countries, and their desire to project a collective impression to the wider world is worth exploring in turn. Firstly, those internal differences. The prime minister, as we know, arrives here with domestic political issues having chased him north from the Commonwealth summit in Rwanda. It'll probably chase him to the summit of the Nato defence alliance in Spain in a few days too. He is out of the country for a week, while Conservatives back home from the cabinet speculate privately about his future. But other leaders face domestic political pressures too. Take President Emmanuel Macron of France, for instance. A few months after being re-elected as president, he's lost control of the French National Assembly. The British government feel Germany and in particular France are feeling the domestic political pressure of some of the consequences of the Ukraine war - not least spiralling prices. After Boris Johnson's meeting with President Macron, Downing Street told us: ""The prime minister stressed any attempt to settle the conflict now will only cause enduring instability and give Putin licence to manipulate both sovereign countries and international markets in perpetuity."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss co-wrote something very similar, with her Ukrainian counterpart, in the Sunday Telegraph. Publicly, No 10 insists President Macron has done ""huge amounts"" to support Ukraine, but privately there is concern Paris is losing appetite for the long-term slog of the war, and its costs. Beyond the internal G7 diplomacy, there are then the efforts being made together to reassure countries beyond the group, some of whom blame western sanctions as much as Russian aggression for rising prices, as my colleague James Landalewrites about here. Argentina, India and South Africa are among the other countries invited here to join discussions. I'm told that tomorrow a quad of key countries will meet here - the United States, France, Germany and the UK. Those around the prime minister talk about the need for a ""gear change"" on sanctions, and they believe the new ones on Russian gold contribute to this, and a ""game changer"" on military support, which will be talked about more at the Nato summit in Madrid. Getting there, this week and beyond, will require persuasion and patience. And it comes at a cost.

Travel-for-surgery offer to cut long waits for ops,"NHS patients in England who have been waiting more than two years for surgery are being offered hospital treatment in alternative parts of the country. More than 6,000 long-term waiting-list patients are being offered travel and accommodation costs where appropriate to help the NHS through the backlog. Health officials want to ensure nobody is waiting more than two years by the end of July. More than 400 patients have already said they would be prepared to travel. Three patients waiting for surgery in Derby have already received treatment in the Northumbria health region, with another two patients booked in, NHS England said. And in south-west London, 17 orthopaedic patients from the South West of England are being treated, with another 11 patients set to follow in the coming weeks. Hospital waiting list at 6.5 million in England 'Please ask the ambulance to hurry or I'll be dead' Gynaecology waits soar by 60% during pandemic Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the number of two-year waits had already reduced by two-thirds since January. ""Innovations like this are helping to tackle waiting lists and speed up access to treatment, backed by record investment,"" he said. Mr Javid also pointed to more than 90 community diagnostic centres delivering more than a million checks and scans in the past year. With weekend clinics and dedicated surgery hubs, he said NHS staff were making ""great progress"" in busting the Covid backlogs. But British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul is warning that attempts to address what he called a ""once in a generation backlog of unimaginable proportions"" would be undermined by a lack of staff and beds. He pointed out that there were already 100,000 vacancies in the NHS in England and that risked getting worse because doctors were ""utterly exhausted"" and their wellbeing was at ""rock bottom"". He will tell the BMA's annual conference in Brighton later that the health service is ""at serious risk of haemorrhaging more doctors"", with many considering early retirement or likely to work fewer hours. He will also say there is a ""parallel hidden backlog of potentially tens of millions waiting for medical, mental health and chronic disease care who don't feature in any government statistics"". There were 22,500 people waiting more than two years for an operation in England in January, but this has fallen by 15,000. However, the latest monthly NHS figures show it was the busiest May for emergency care, with 2.2 million A&E attendances. And nearly 6.5 million people in England are waiting for hospital treatment - a record high - with many waiting for knee and hip replacements, and eye surgery. Backlogs built up during the Covid pandemic as hospitals treated thousands of people who were ill with the virus, forcing patients with other illnesses to wait much longer than usual for surgery or treatment. Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""Millions who did not seek help earlier in the pandemic are now coming forward."" But she said despite the emergence of the Omicron variant and a difficult winter, the NHS was on track to ""eliminate two-year waiters"" by the end of July. ""One of the benefits of the NHS is that hospitals can work together to bring Covid backlogs down together, and so if people can and want to be treated quicker elsewhere in the country, NHS staff are ensuring that it can happen,"" Ms Pritchard said. However, even if patients are happy to be treated in another part of the country, it might not always be possible because of the specialist nature of their treatment.

PM signals controls on steel imports to stay,"The prime minister has signalled controls on steel imports that were due to expire this week could be retained. When asked whether this could lead to a possible breach of international law, Boris Johnson responded ""these are tough choices we have to make"". It follows a proposed approach set out by the international trade secretary on Thursday. But the Department for International Trade said a final decision has not yet been made. Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect British producers which are already under pressure from rising energy prices. ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy,"" Mr Johnson said. ""But until we can fix that, I think it is reasonable for UK steel to have the same protections that absolutely every other European steel economy does."" Energy-intensive firms to get electricity bill help UK makes last-ditch extension to steel protections Earlier this month, Mr Johnson linked the resignation of his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to a disagreement about future decisions on steel tariffs. But Mr Geidt said that interpretation of his decision to quit didn't reflect ""the far wider scope of my objection"". The limits on steel imports being considered were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. The restrictions, which add a tariff to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories are set to expire on 30 June. The question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. The prime minister has been at the G7 summit discussing shaping the global economy Asked whether the government was considering imposing tariffs which may be illegal, cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the government was focused on ""ensuring we work within international law."" Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the Northern Ireland Secretary said he was ""not saying the government is going to do this"" but that ""this is something that is supported across the sector"" and the government has ""got to look at all these things"" and ""get the balance right."" UK Steel, the lobby group for the British steel industry, said it was confident extending the steel controls would be ""WTO compliant"" and ""there would be no legitimate reason for challenges"". The Department for International Trade said it is consulting with foreign counterparts in adherence with World Trade Organization rules, before making a final decision on whether to extend the safeguards. UK Steel said ending the import controls would expose British steelmakers to a distorted global marketplace and that could cause as much as Â£150m a year in damage. Also speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour would support the prime minister in the tariffs being continued. ""It's an extension that both the EU and the Americans have continued with so we would support him,"" he said. ""Steel workers support him, the unions support him, industry supports him and Labour does support him."" But the Conservative MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat tweeted today: ""Protectionism is destructive to all of us. Tariffs are un-Conservative because they're a tax on consumers.""

US firms pledge to pay abortion travel expenses,"Major companies including Disney, JP Morgan and Facebook owner Meta have told staff they will cover employee travel expenses for abortions, as millions of US women face restricted access. It follows a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. The judgement paves the way for individual states to ban the procedure. Other firms, such as Amazon, had already announced similar moves. But since the ruling a growing number of companies have confirmed they will cover travel costs through their health insurance plans for employees who leave their home state to get an abortion. What is Roe v Wade ruling on abortion? What happens now Roe v Wade has been overturned? Disney said it had told employees it recognised the impact of the Supreme Court ruling and remained committed to giving them ""comprehensive access"" to affordable healthcare, including family planning and reproductive care, ""no matter where they live"". Disney employs around 80,000 people at its resort in Florida, where the governor has already signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which is scheduled to take effect on 1 July. Banking giant JP Morgan also told its US employees it would cover travel expenses for medical services, including ""legal abortions"", according to a staff memo, dated 1 June and seen by Reuters news agency. ""We're focused on the health and well-being of our employees, and want to ensure equitable access to all benefits,"" a bank spokeswoman said on Friday. This video can not be played WATCH: Chaotic scenes as Taser drawn at US abortion protest Another leading US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, also said it would cover travel expenses for employees who needed to go to another state to get an abortion from 1 July, according to Reuters. Social media company Meta said it intended to reimburse travel expenses where permitted by law, ""for employees who will need them to access out-of-state health care"". ""We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,"" a spokesperson added. Other companies which have indicated they will take similar steps include Vogue publisher Conde Nast, jeans brand Levi Strauss, and ride hailing companies Lyft and Uber. Lyft also said it would legally shield drivers in abortion cases, with a spokesperson adding that ""no driver should have to ask a rider where they are going and why"". Several other companies, including Amazon, review website Yelp, and banking giant Citigroup, had alreadysaid before the Supreme Court rulingthat they would reimburse employees who travel to circumvent local abortion restrictions Yelp chief executive Jeremy Stoppelman said on Twitter,externalthat the court's decision ""puts women's health in jeopardy"", adding that ""business leaders must speak out"". Abortion will not automatically become illegal in the US - but individual states will now be allowed to decide if and how to allow abortions. A total of 13 states have already passed ""trigger laws"", which come into effect upon Roe v Wade being overturned, to outlaw abortion. More than 20 states are making moves to limit access, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Companies which offer to cover the cost of travelling to another state for the procedure are likely to face a backlash from anti-abortion Republicans. Lawmakers in Texas have already threatened Citigroup and Lyft with legal repercussions,while the state's Republican Party chairman Matt Rinaldi urged Republicans not to use Citi's services,external. Abortion is a highly divisive issue in the US. A recent Pew survey found that 61% of adults say abortion should be legal all or most of the time, while 37% say it should be illegal all or most of the time.

Summit brings abortion clinic buffer zones closer,"This video can not be played The first minister convened a meeting to discuss options to protect women using clinics The first minister has said legislation will be passed to enforce protester buffer zones at abortion clinics. Nicola Sturgeon gave the Scottish government's backing to a member's bill protecting access to terminations. At a summit in Edinburgh she said people were entitled to differing views on abortion, but women should not be intimidated while accessing healthcare. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that there would be complexities around making legislation stand up to legal scrutiny. The new legislation would see 150m (164 yard) no-go areas put in outside health facilities. MSP wrong to criticise abortion clinics - Sturgeon Fresh calls for UK abortion clinic buffer zones The first minister had invited councils, charities, police, health professionals and campaigners to the summit on abortion care following calls for action over protests outside clinics. Pro-choice campaigners want to ensure that women can access services without fear, harassment or intimidation. Anti-abortion protesters at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said she supported the member's bill, introduced by Green MSP Gillian Mackay. She said: ""There's no doubt in my mind we need to aim for legislation in the long term. ""But we need to ensure we get the balance of that right so that it would be capable of withstanding any human rights challenge. ""There's further action we can take, working with councils and the police in the short term, to make sure that women do have access to healthcare. ""There are different views on abortion - we live in a democracy and people are free to have different views on abortion - but what I don't think any of us are free to do is to impede women's right to access healthcare without intimidation and harassment."" The summit follows recent reports of escalating incidents at the Sandyford clinic in central Glasgow. Women's Health Minister Maree Todd, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that patients had told her that protests were intimidating. She said: ""Everybody who is accessing healthcare at these sites has to run the gauntlet past them ""We have seen an escalation in behaviour. We have seen really, truly offensive signage being held up, voice amplification across the front of the building. ""People are unable to ignore the protests and we have potentially seen the use of bodycams which is a real invasion of privacy."" Green MSP Gillian Mackay has introduced a member's bill Ms Sturgeon faces some opposition from within her own party. MSP John Mason said he was ""not convinced"" the issue was a problem. He said the protests he had seen were not intimidating and that people did not have to go near them. He said: ""We have to listen to people's experience but there's two types of experience - people who say they are feeling harassed and intimidated, and people who say they are being coerced into abortions and are not being given the pros and cons."" Anti-abortion groups, such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, have said they would continue to defend the right to pray in public and offer help to women outside clinics. UK court ruling on NI abortion law due Glasgow Council's abortion protest buffer zone report overdue Lois McLatchie, from the Christian campaigning group ADF UK, told the BBC her volunteers were offering support and advice on alternatives to abortion. She added: ""Buffer zones ban legitimate offers of help and silent prayer and mean women may not be able to access those other options - practical help or financial help. ""Women have the right to hear about these options at the point of need and it is patronising of the government saying women don't want to hear this."" There are fears the recent reversal of abortion rights in the US will ""embolden"" protesters in Scotland However, Alice Murray of pro-choice group Back Off Scotland -  said there was a misunderstanding from some anti-abortion campaigners over what happens at clinic appointments. She said: ""Women don't need to be offered the other side by strangers outside. You are talked through the process and your options by a specific healthcare provider. ""We believe it should be the NHS and healthcare providers who give that information. A lot of the leaflets we see handed out outside these clinics have misinformation on them. ""These people outside can't be trusted to give accurate advice or support. It's highly inappropriate."" The summit came afterthe US Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v Wade decision, transforming abortion rights in America and allowing individual states to ban the procedure. Green MSP Gillian Mackay, who introduced Scotland's members' bill, said the US move would ""stop safe abortions and put lives at risk."" She said: ""Here we need to continue to fight for progress. That means buffer zones, telemedical abortion and services safe and accessible for all. ""There is no place for the type of intimidation and harassment we are regularly seeing outside these healthcare facilities at the moment. ""Both healthcare staff, and those accessing services, have relayed horrifying stories of the impact this harassment can have.""

MPs to vote on plans to ditch parts of Brexit deal,"The government wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland MPs will vote on Monday on new legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The government wants to change the NI Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed legislation on the deal could be passed by the end of the year. The EU opposes the move, saying it breaches international law. The government is aiming to fast track the protocol bill through the House of Commons before the summer recess in mid July. It is proposing to condense the committee stage of the legislation across just three days - a process which can sometimes take weeks. Boris Johnson was asked about the legislation while at a meeting of world leaders in Germany The protocol is part of the 2019 Brexit deal and keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means checks on some items which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. Speaking to the BBC, the prime minister said its plan could be carried out ""fairly rapidly"". ""What we are trying to do is fix something that is very important to our country, which is the balance of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,"" Mr Johnson said. ""You have got one tradition, one community, that feels that things really aren't working in a way that they like or understand."" He argued ""unnecessary"" barriers to trade could be removed without endangering the EU single market. But the PM said it would be ""even better"" to agree more flexibility with Brussels. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the protocol bill was ""no fix"" and would damage the Good Friday peace deal, rather than protect it. Allow Twitter content?

Ahead of the vote, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the protocol was undermining peace in Northern Ireland. The government's plans, published earlier in June, faced a fierce backlash from the EU, whichlaunched legal action against the UK governmentover the legislation. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has also indicated that further measures may follow if the bill proceeds, including atrade war between the UK and EU. The protocol is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? How will NI protocol plans affect businesses? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in May's assembly election but the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which came second, is refusing to re-enter a power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. Ms Truss said on Sunday night that the protocol was undermining the peace and stability secured in Northern Ireland by the Good Friday Agreement. Three Northern Ireland parties - Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP, who collectively won the most seats in May's election - say the protocol is necessary to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The UK governmentpublished plansfor the bill earlier this month. At the centre of the proposal is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and for Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. After a debate on Monday, MPs will then vote on whether the bill can proceed for further consideration. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party will vote against the legislation, adding that they would scrap the proposed laws if it was in power. The prime minister may also face opposition from his backbenches after heovercame a vote of confidence among Conservative MPs earlier in June. This is another big day at Westminster and one that could expose just how many problems Boris Johnson has with rebels in his own party. Bruised from theby-election defeats last week, some may seek to punish him further by voting against the bill or abstaining. However, according to several London sources, a large rebellion is unlikely. Regardless, it's thought the government wants to push the bill through its remaining Commons stages before summer recess - a move that will spark strong reaction in Belfast and Brussels. The DUP has welcomed the move but there's still some way to go before it will commit to return to power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Other parties, including Sinn FÃ©in, say the bill breaks international law and are urging MPs to vote it down. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would ""consider what steps we can take"" if the bill gets through all its Commons stages intact. ""We have made clear that getting decisive action on the protocol, addressing the harm that the protocol is doing to Northern Ireland, is very important to rebuild the cross-community consensus that is essential for power-sharing to work. ""We're already beginning the preparatory working for the restoration of the devolved institutions, but as to when that might happen I've made clear that we will be condition led, not calendar led."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said if the bill goes through intact his party would look to respond in terms of restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the government was prepared to rip up international law and threaten the stability of the Good Friday Agreement. ""This is a country that is turning into a rogue state,"" he said. ""This is all about Boris Johnson shoring up the support of the hard right of the Tory Party, this is nothing to do with the DUP or Northern Ireland or even the protocol, it's about Boris Johnson and everything he does is about himself."" In a statement ahead of the vote, Ms Truss said: ""This legislation will fix the problems the protocol has created, ensuring that goods can flow freely within the UK, while avoiding a hard border and safeguarding the EU single market. ""A negotiated solution has been and remains our preference, but the EU continues to rule out changing the protocol itself - even though it is patently causing serious problems in Northern Ireland - which therefore means we are obliged to act."" The EU has said it is unwilling to renegotiate the protocol but has offered to work on different aspects of how it is implemented. Earlier this week, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saidthe UK government's plans would be ""economic vandalism""on Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Second reading of protocol bill set for next week EU takes new legal action over Brexit deal changes What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Thousands of PwC staff to get 9% pay rise,"Thousands of PwC staff are to get a 9% pay rise in response to rising living costs and a competitive recruitment market, the accountancy giant has said. The company said half of its more than 20,000 employees in the UK would get an increase of at least 9%, while 70% would get a rise of 7% or more. With vacancies at a record high, many firms are offering pay rises to attract and retain staff. But ministers have warned big salary rises could further fuel price rises. Inflation - the rate at which prices go up -hit 9.1% in the UK in May, the highest level for 40 years. However, for many people, wages are failing to keep up,with regular pay falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices. Why are prices rising so quickly? Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? PwC said salaries for many of its entry-level programmes would also increase, with starting salaries in audit roles rising by 10% and consulting graduates getting a rise of just over 8%. Chairman Kevin Ellis said the company ""can't ignore market pressures and want to ensure pay at every level is as competitive as possible"". ""We know pay will be an increasingly important consideration given rising living costs - we want to stay competitive and continue attracting the best talent and skills from across the UK,"" he added. The company said it was investing more than Â£120m in pay rises, as well as allocating a further Â£138m to bonuses this year - up Â£10m on the previous year. Other companies,such as Lloyds Bank, have offered staff one-off payments to help them cope with the rising cost of living. However, Mr Ellis said base pay was ""particularly important... given the bearing it can have on mortgages and future salary"". Earlier this week,a union representing Rolls-Royce workers rejected the company's offer of a Â£2,000 one-off payment, saying it fell ""far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". Other sectors have also increased pay in recent months, with supermarket chains Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda all announcing rises as they battle for staff. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, which was at the centre of last week's rail strikes, is looking for a pay rise of at least 7%. The union says Network Rail's offer of a 2% pay rise, with the possibility of a further 1%, was ""unacceptable"", pointing to the rising cost of living. In May,official figures showed there were more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UKfor the first time since records began. However, earlier this month, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke warned employees they should not expect their wages to rise in line with inflation. He told the BBC big salary increases to meet the rising cost of living could end up with a 1970-style ""inflationary spiral"", where companies hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices. The independent public sector pay review bodies are due to report in the coming weeks on the level of increase for workers - including employees in health, schools and prisons. Unions are pressing to have the pay increases reflect the rising cost of living. But Mr Clarke, the Treasury minister in charge of the pay review body process, said there was no automatic link between inflation and pay setting.

Root and Pope shine as England hunt 296 to win,"This video can not be played Highlights: Pope & Root put England on course for 3-0 series win Third LV Insurance Test, Headingley (day four of five) New Zealand 329(Mitchell 109, Leach 5-100)& 326(Blundell 88*, Latham 76; Leach 5-66) England 360(Bairstow 162, Overton 97) &183-2(Pope 81*, Root 55*) England need further 113 runs to win Scorecard England need 113 runs with eight wickets in hand to complete another superb final-day victory against New Zealand in the third Test at Headingley. Set 296 to win, England hurried along once again to reach 183-2 on day four. Ollie Pope made 81 not out and Joe Root an unbeaten 55, putting on 132 after Alex Lees was run out for nine and Zak Crawley caught for a frantic 25. After chasing 277 in the first Test and breathlessly pursuing 299 to win the second, victory in Leeds will give England a 3-0 series clean sweep over the World Test champions. They would have hoped to earn themselves a smaller target when New Zealand resumed on 168-5 - 137 ahead - but were thwarted by Tom Blundell's 88 not out. Blundell, who overturned an lbw decision on 52 and was dropped on 67, combined with Daryl Mitchell yet again for their fourth century stand of the series. Mitchell fell lbw for 56 to the impressive Matthew Potts 50 minutes into the afternoon session before Jack Leach took the last four wickets to claim 5-66 and his first 10-wicket match haul in Tests. This video can not be played 'He will be on top of the world' - Tufnell on Leach If England pull off the win they will become the first team to chase 250 three times in a row. A full house is expected on Monday after Yorkshire followed the lead of Nottinghamshire, the hosts of the second Test, in allowing spectators in for free to watch this energised England side attempt to do so. 'I've never experienced anything like it' - Leach TMS podcast: Root and Pope put England in control Before this series, when England had won only one of their past 17 Tests, a chase of almost 300 would have looked way beyond them. But they have been transformed under new coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes to the point that anything now looks possible. At Trent Bridge last week they had 72 overs to chase 299 and did so in 50. With four sessions to reach their target on this occasion, they batted in slightly more measured fashion but still eased along at more than four an over, Joe Root reverse sweeping his first ball and later playing an outrageous scoop for six off pace bowler Neil Wagner. This video can not be played 'Extraordinary brilliance!' - Root reverse-scoops Wagner for six New Zealand's only spinner, part-timer Michael Bracewell, was ineffective and seamers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were neutered by a lack of movement and a flat pitch. Showers are forecast on Monday morning, but there should still be time for either side to force a win. In truth, England would not have wanted the close to have come because Pope and Root were cruising in late-evening sunshine against bedraggled opponents hurt by the decision to leave out frontline spinner Ajaz Patel. Both batters nicked between wicketkeeper and first slip off Bracewell's off-spin but otherwise were comfortable. Pope batted at a spritely pace, as he did in his 145 in the second Test, and drove elegantly through the covers. He also brought composure to proceedings after a frantic start during which Lees was run out in the fifth over after a mix-up with Crawley, who himself played an innings that summed up his international career. Crawley was dropped on nought playing a wild drive, cracked four elegant fours in one Boult over and then carelessly tried to hit Bracewell out of the rough to be caught at extra cover. He ended the series without a fifty. Shortly after, New Zealand burned two reviews in consecutive balls to try to dismiss Root lbw, but on both occasions the ball hit him outside the line of off stump. If the match seems to be following the pattern of the previous two Tests, the first session was also very familiar. England were resolutely blunted by Mitchell and Blundell, who became only the fifth pair to share four century stands in a series. Blundell's haul of 383 runs is the best by a visiting wicketkeeper in England. This video can not be played 'Potts has got his man!'- Mitchell trapped lbw He was left stranded when, after Mitchell perished playing across the line, the lower order tried to attack. Leach capitalised as Bracewell swiped to deep mid-wicket, Tim Southee was bowled and Neil Wagner was caught between the legs of wicketkeeper Sam Billings, who was rushed into the game as aCovid-19 replacementfor Ben Foakes. This video can not be played 'Is he out?' - Neil Wagner is caught by Sam Billings Leach ended with match figures of 10-166 to become the first England spinner to take 10 in a Test since Moeen Ali five years ago. Along with Pope and Jonny Bairstow, he looks to be one of the players to have benefitted most from the appointment of Stokes and McCullum. England's Jack Leach told BBC Sport:""We have had a really strong day and are pleased how we batted with Joe Root and Ollie Pope. ""We stuck at it with the bowling this morning - we got our rewards. Matthew Potts was unbelievable and it was great to be part of."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""The New Zealand attack looked on the ropes. ""It's the best three Test matches England have played in many years, and you can see the players have bought into this brand of cricket."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""If England are able to start on time they might get them in a session tomorrow morning.

Did Nazi Rudolf Hess have a family link to Wales?,"Rudolf Hess, pictured to the right of Adolf Hitler, arrived in Wales 80 years ago When Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess arrived in a small south Wales town, mystery surrounded why he was there. Some suspected it was not really him. Even today no-one really knows why he was in the UK. Historian Phil Carradice suspects Hess was sentimental about Wales because of a connection with his father, Carl Hess. Hess arrived in Britain on 10 May 1941, when he parachuted into Scotland, where he was first detained. Then he was taken to the Tower of London and fortified Surrey mansion Mytchett Place before his arrival at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, exactly 80 years ago. There was no attempt to keep his arrival at the former psychiatric hospital, Maindiff Court, a secret. Mr Carradice believes Wales was special to Hess. How the Welsh language saved World War Two soldiers' lives The Welsh drifter who helped end WW2 ""It is possible that Carl Hess, Rudolf's father, actually lived in Cardiff for a short while,"" he said. ""Certainly Carl's first wife was buried in the parish churchyard at Michaelston-y-Fedw (on the city outskirts)."" He believed Hess could have asked to be sent to Abergavenny because of the possible family connection and his friendship with Lord Tredegar. ""This might have suited the British authorities quite well as Abergavenny was out of the limelight and easier to protect Hess from himself and others who would have wanted to do him harm before he was brought to trial,"" Mr Carradice said. Mystery surrounded the reason Rudolf Hess was in Wales Mr Carradice said Hess arrived in Scotland apparently to negotiate an end to the war, but doubted he would have had the authority to do that. ""Everything to do with Hess involves a certain amount of guess work, as right up to his death he never really revealed his true thoughts,"" he said. ""One possibility was that he felt he was increasingly being edged out of Hitler's inner circle by the up-and-coming Nazis such as Himmler, Goring and Bormann. ""Another option is that he was simply more prescient than other Nazis and had already seen the writing on the wall for the ultimate outcome of the war."" There could be evidence for this, Mr Carradice explained. ""As early as the start of 1941, a Russian spy in Tokyo, Richard Sorge, was warning Stalin of an impending attack on Pearl Harbour by the Japanese,"" said Mr Carradice. ""Stalin ignored the threat and never shared the information with the Americans, but it's not a huge leap of faith to presume that if news had reached Moscow, Berlin were also aware of the plans. ""If Hess did know of the plans, he must have known Germany could never have won the war once America became involved, so maybe he was simply attempting to save his own neck."" This is something Hess actually achieved - while many Nazis were hanged after the Nuremburg trials, his co-operation with the Allies was taken into account and he received life imprisonment instead. Historian Phil Carradice believes Hess (third from left) may have been sentimental about Wales But Mr Carradice believes Hess didn't know what he was doing. He said: ""He was an extremely mentally fragile man who craved attention, was deeply paranoid and who'd already attempted to take his own life while he was in custody in Surrey. ""I also think he had a deeply skewed impression of the power structure in Britain, through his association with Unity Mitford."" Mitford wasan English aristocrat and Nazi, and one of the socialite Mitford sisters. Mr Carradice thought Hess gained from her the idea the aristocracy were Britain's real powerbrokers, and that Hess could appeal to England and Germany's shared heritage. Hess, pictured (right) with fascist Italian leader Benito Mussolini, is rumoured to have dined with Lord Tredegar in Newport He knew Mitford between 1935 and 1939, before a failed suicide attemptleft her with a bullet lodged in her brain. ""Hess was wowed by everything aristocratic and the idea that he could talk to them on the same level flattered his sensitive ego,"" said Mr Carradice. At Maindiff Court, Hess was heavily guarded, as much against suicide as escape, but he still enjoyed considerable freedom. He was driven around the countryside by his jailers, and allowed to walk around the grounds. He was let out to paint landmarks such as White Castle and The Skirrid mountain. Once he is even rumoured to have dined with Lord Tredegar at Tredegar House in Newport. ""Lord Tredegar was something of an eccentric peer who was in charge of messenger pigeons during the war, just the sort of man who Hess thought he should be dealing with. ""Right up until the very end I believe he felt he could talk his way out of it, if only he'd gained access to the right class of people,"" said Mr Carradice. But Hess couldn't talk his way out of it. In 1945, Hess, pictured second from left, was among many high-ranking Nazis to stand trial in Nuremburg In October 1945 he was taken from Abergavenny to stand trial at Nuremburg. There he was convicted of being a key architect of the Nazi regime and sentenced life imprisonment at Berlin's Spandau Prison where he sharedstories of Abergavenny with Welsh guard Colin Lambert. Hess was the last prisoner at Spandau. For the last 21 years of his life he had the entire jail to himself. After his death on 17 August 1987, the site was demolished. To stop it becoming a Nazi shrine it was ground into powder and dumped in the North Sea. The only known remains of Spandau are a set of keys in a Scottish museum.

UK and US to ban imports of Russian gold,"The UK, US, Canada and Japan will ban imports of Russian gold in an effort to hit Moscow's ability to fund the war in Ukraine. The UK PM said the move would ""strike at the heart of Putin's war machine"". Gold exports were worth Â£12.6bn ($15.4bn) to Russia in 2021, and the UK says their importance has increased since the invasion as oligarchs rush to buy bullion to avoid sanctions. It comes as the G7 group of the world's richest nations meet in Germany. US President Biden suggested the other G7 nations - Germany, France and Italy - would also join the ban. ""Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia,"" he said in a tweet. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""We need to starve the Putin regime of its funding. The UK and our allies are doing just that."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? G7 face battle for unity as cost of war mounts With London a major global trading hub for gold, the UK government said the move would have a huge impact on President Putin's ability to raise funds. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Western countries have introduced a range of sanctions targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises. The US, European Union, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses so far. The latest measure will mean UK import restrictions will apply to Russian exports worth around Â£13.5bn. The UK said the gold import ban would come into force shortly, with legislation introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks. It will apply to newly mined or refined gold, and does not impact gold previously exported from Russia. There are no plans to extend restrictions to Russian gold purchased legitimately before the import ban was put in place. Discussions at the G7 summit in Bavaria are expected to focus on the international response to the war in Ukraine, as well as soaring prices and the global food crisis.

Hajj travellers unable to fly due to ticket delay,"About 2.5 million pilgrims visited Islam's holiest site in 2019 Some British Muslims who booked pilgrimages to Mecca have been unable to board a flight as problems with a new Saudi registration system continue. About a dozen people were told they could not fly from Manchester on Saturday as e-tickets covering flights and the Hajj were not issued in time,the Council of British Hajjis said,external. They had to return home as they wait to hear if flights can be rearranged. The BBC has contacted the Saudi Embassy for a response. The country recently launched anonline portal,externalwhere Muslims from Europe, North America and Australia must register if they want to take part in this year's Hajj pilgrimage, which is due to start in July. Selected applicants received booking confirmations for the packages in the past few weeks, although the system - known as Motawif - has promptedseveral complaints, including from some who had previously booked with separate operators and were concerned they could lose money. Council of British Hajjis chair Rashid Mogradia (left) said England cricketer Adil Rashid was among those who flew out Many pilgrims save for years, however the costs - ranging from Â£6,000 to more than Â£10,000 per person in the UK - often draw criticism about over-priced packages. Rashid Mogradia, chair of the Council of British Hajjis (CBHUK), said Saudia staff at Manchester had been ""very helpful"" but it was ""heart-breaking"" to see some people unable to board the plane. He said about 250 travellers, including England cricketer Adil Rashid, were able to fly out. Hajj occurs during the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar It is an annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites in and around Mecca, where Prophet Muhammad was born Pilgrims imitate the rites of his ancestral predecessor Abraham - believed by Muslims to have built the cubic shrine known as the Kaaba - and his family Hajj is one of the five key pillars of the Islamic faith and is compulsory for any adult Muslim who is physically and financially eligible Many Muslims also perform a shorter Umrah pilgrimage, which - unlike the Hajj - is optional and can happen throughout the year Prices for the tour packages usually cover flights, transport, accommodation, catering and visa services Some applicants have told the BBC that they had received mixed messages about whether they could travel this year. Ali Haider said he and his wife had returned to their Sheffield home after being unable to fly from Manchester on Saturday, despite paying Â£18,500 for their total package. He said they had received booking and visa confirmations in the past week, adding: ""We assumed everything was sorted, but we were never emailed the e-ticket."" Mr Haider spoke to a Motawif representative on the phone from the airport, but said ""it was astonishing how inept they were"". The organisation eventuallyapologised,externalto Mr Haider on Twitter and said it planned to ""rearrange some flights due to high demand for plane seats on some dates"". ""It feels to us like they are kind of unanswerable to anybody,"" Mr Haider said. ""It would be unthinkable that a UK company would do anything like this. I think the whole process has been run badly."" On Monday, Motawiftweeted that it was aware of problems,externalin a number of cases related to booking confirmations and was attempting to contact those affected within 72 hours. The BBC has attempted to contact the organisation. Volunteers have been assisting pilgrims flying out to Saudi Arabia British and other Western pilgrims could previously book via Saudi-licensed agents in their home countries. Prof Sean McLoughlin, from the University of Leeds, has beenresearching the Hajj industry,externalsince 2011, and said the new system was ""part of Saudi Arabia's strategy to centralise and simplify packages sales"". The kingdom has said it will host amillion pilgrims,externalthis year as it accommodates foreign visitors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic. However it is not clear how many Hajj visas are being allocated to the UK, which was designated about 25,000 in 2019. Prof McLoughlin said figures have ranged from 3,000 to 12,000. ""While the previous system was sometimes exploited by fraudsters, the best agents sought to make the complexities of Hajj easier for their pilgrims,"" he said. ""Motawif's failed miserably as it's come far too late - it's not been piloted or trialled, and it hasn't proved as flexible or competitively priced as first claimed. ""The other problem is that Motawif is not communicating clearly and is contradicting itself - they don't seem to have the capacity to deliver and their technical system has let them down badly."" He said the process was ""at crisis point"" as people were ""turning up at airports and being told they could not travel"". A number of people have contacted the BBC with concerns that their bookings may not be fulfilled. Yasmin Qureshi MP, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah, had previouslycalled on the Saudi governmentto delay the new system until next year. She warned it was ""not going to work"" and asked Hajj minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan Al-Rabiah if refunds would be given. The UK'sForeign and Commonwealth Office,externalhas said it is ""aware that not all problems have been resolved and continue to seek information from the Saudi authorities"".

"Return of Covid restrictions unlikely, says Leitch","This video can not be played Scotland's national clinical director does not think mandatory Covid restrictions will return Mandatory coronavirus restrictions are unlikely to return despite a significant rise in cases, Scotland's national clinical director has said. Prof Jason Leitch said there would be ""small prices to pay"" in order to ensure ""normality"" continues. However, he added that he believed it would take a ""dramatic"" change for restrictions to be brought back. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates one in 20 people had the virus in the week ending 17 June. The latest data estimates 250,700 people in private households in Scotland had Covid last week. One in 20 people in Scotland had Covid last week Covid in Scotland: The latest cases Covid cases increase by more than 30% in Scotland That is an increase on the previous week when about 176,900, or one in 30 people, had Covid. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said it would be ""sensible"" for people to wear face coverings indoors, however there is no legal requirement to do so. Speaking onBBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Prof Leitch said he ""honestly"" did not believe restrictions would be reintroduced. He said: ""Something dramatic would have to happen to the virus. ""We've got fatigue from this. We're all a bit fed up. People are going back about their business. ""Glastonbury is on, TRNSMT is on next week. I remember us talking about TRNSMT a year ago where we were struggling to get it back on. ""All of those things are really, really important to get back."" But he warned the public that they should take small measures to ensure ""normality"" continues. ""Science, vaccination, staying off your work, face coverings are small prices to pay in order to get society back,"" he added. Prof Leitchhas just recovered from Covid-19himself after he shared a positive lateral flow test on social media. The exact number of people with the virus in Scotland is unknown since regular testing of the public ended in April. Prof Leitch said that while we should be ""concerned"" about the rise in cases, the spike was ""entirely predictable"". He said people should not ""underreact"" but added ""let's not overreact either because vaccines, antivirals, we know what to do. ""We're able to live this in a different way that we could have before,"" he said.

"Keep up unity on Ukraine amid war fatigue, says PM","Speaking at the G7 summit, Boris Johnson praised the support for Ukraine from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz Boris Johnson has said leaders must be honest about rising costs due to the Ukraine war, but said the price of Russia succeeding was ""far higher"". He said world leaders understand they must remain united with Kyiv despite fears of war fatigue. Allies were ""making the sacrifice"" over rising food and energy costs because ""the price of freedom is worth paying,"" he said. The PM is at the G7 summit as he faces pressure over his leadership at home. After leaving Germany, Mr Johnson will head to Madrid for a Nato summit before flying home on Thursday - his first return to the UK since the Conservatives lost two by-elections. He has rejected calls to resign, saying he is focused on the cost of living, the economy and ""standing up to violence and aggression"" in Ukraine. Speaking in the Bavarian Alps where the G7 summit is being held, Mr Johnson said leaders would be discussing how to keep the coalition of support together ""at a time when realistically there is going to be fatigue among populations and politicians"". He said Nato and the G7 continue to be ""solid"" in their stand against the invasion by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but to protect that unity they must have ""really, really honest discussions"" about the pressures each nation is under. G7 face battle for unity as cost of war mounts Zelensky addresses music fans as Glastonbury opens New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry The prime minister gave the example of Germany, which is takingemergency measures after Russia cut gas supplies, saying: ""They're making the effort, they're making the sacrifice. That's because they see the price of freedom is worth paying."" He said the G7 and Nato were defending the principle that a free, sovereign country should not be ""violently invaded and have its boundaries changed by force"". ""The price of backing down, of allowing President Putin to hack off parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest - that price will be far, far higher and everyone here understands that,"" Mr Johnson said. The G7 leaders have travelled to the Bavarian Alps for the annual summit In an interview with CNN on Sunday Mr Johnson was asked about surviving a confidence vote and his party's by-election defeats and insisted the scrutiny he had faced had been a good thing. The prime minister questioned whether Russia's invasion of Ukraine would have happened if Mr Putin had faced similar dissent and had ""the 1922 committee on his case"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to address the G7 countries - the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - on Monday. Ukraine is urgently asking for more financial help due to fears it could run out of funding by the autumn without further support. Mr Johnson is due to pledge Â£429m to Ukraine in guarantees for World Bank lending, as its fight against the Russian invasion drags on. The loan guarantees provided by the UK will take its package of economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine to Â£1.5bn. The British government feels Germany and in particular France are feeling the domestic political pressure of some of the consequences of the Ukraine war - not least spiralling prices. After Boris Johnson's meeting with President Macron, Downing Street told us: ""The prime minister stressed any attempt to settle the conflict now will only cause enduring instability and give Putin licence to manipulate both sovereign countries and international markets in perpetuity."" Publicly, No 10 insists President Macron has done ""huge amounts"" to support Ukraine, but privately there is concern Paris is losing appetite for the long-term slog of the war, and its costs. Those around the prime minister talk about the need for a ""gear change"" on sanctions, and they believe the new ones on Russian gold contribute to this, and a ""game changer"" on military support, which will be talked about more at the Nato summit in Madrid. Getting there, this week and beyond, will require persuasion and patience. And it comes at a cost. Read more on this here. The prime minister told CNN he thought Brexit had allowed the UK to better assist Ukraine in defending itself against Russia. ""I don't think that we would have been out in front as the first European country to arm the Ukrainians,"" he said. At the summit on Sunday, Mr Johnson had talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, where the prime minister was said to have stressed that any attempt to settle the conflict now would only give Mr Putin ""licence to manipulate sovereign countries"". He also had a meeting with Canada's Justin Trudeau, where Mr Johnson said Ukraine was ""on a knife-edge"" and needed defensive capabilities, training and intelligence to tip the balance in its favour. The Canadian and UK prime ministers discussed what Ukraine needed to gain the advantage in the conflict Ahead of the summit, Mr Johnson warned that Ukrainians should not be encouraged to ""settle for a bad peace"" where they were ""invited to give up chunks of their territory in return for a ceasefire"". He said: ""Ukraine can win and it will win. But they need our backing to do so. Now is not the time to give up on Ukraine."" Boris Johnson will also urge Western allies to increase sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies. Mr Johnson said the UK, Canada, the US and Japan were banning imports of Russian gold, saying the move will ""directly hit Russian oligarchs and strike at the heart of Putin's war machine"". The UK government says gold is a major Russian export, worth Â£12.6bn to its economy in 2021 and increasingly used by the country's oligarchs to try to avoid the impact of sanctions. At the Nato summit, the prime minister will also push for increased defence spending across the alliance and support Sweden and Finland's bids to join the organisation. Asked if he thought there was going to be a global recession, the prime minister said the world was facing ""a lot of headwinds"" due to rising prices linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said that it was pointless to focus ""on how bad things might get"" and that he believed things would get eventually better and inflation would slow.

What sanctions are being imposed?,"The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine. The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. Announcing500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals. President Biden said the measures wouldalso target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. The UKhas frozen the assets of six bosses at the prisonand banned them from travelling to the UK. The UK has also imposed new bans on Russianmetal, diamond and energy exports. The EU hasannounced sanctions on 200 organisations and people,externalwhich it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia. Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, haveimposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia,external. Their main target has been Russia's money. Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (Â£276bn)- about half its total reserves - were frozen. About70% of the assets of Russian banks,externalwere also frozen, the EU says, and some wereexcluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions. Western nations have also: banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia banned flights from Russia sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned Russia's oil industry has been another major target. The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports. The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposeda maximum price of $60 (Â£47) a barrel,externalon Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings. Hundreds of major firms, includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken,have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. However, some still do business in Russia. PepsiCo, for example, has been accused ofcontinuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered thatUS cosmetics firm Avonwas making goods in a factory near Moscow. President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying:""We have growth, and they have decline."",external Russia has managed to selloil abroad for more than the G7's price cap,external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it,external. The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting8.3 million barrels of oil a day,external- having increased supplies to India and China. Russiais also able to import many sanctioned Western goods,externalby buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.""

However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024. Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia,having cut 5% from the economic growth,externalit might have had over the past two years. But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"".

South African police investigate nightclub deaths,"Forensic teams are investigating at the the scene The youngest victim among the at least 21 people who died at a drinking place at the weekend was 13, police minister Bheki Cele has said. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear and the authorities are investigating. The victims were found strewn across floors and tables at the Enyobeni Tavern in the town of East London. The bodies were taken to mortuaries, where post-mortem examinations will be carried out. Mr Cele, who had visited the scene and was briefed by the local police, said those who had died were between the ages of 13 and 17 - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The legal minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18. There are reports that people who had gone to the tavern were celebrating the end of school exams. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to families of the victims. ""This tragedy is made even more grave by its occurrence during Youth Month - a time during which we... advocate and advance opportunities for improved socio-economic conditions for the youth of our nation,"" he said in a tweet. Oscar Mabuyane, premier of East Cape Province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Speaking at the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment."" The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday. A provincial safety official told AFP news agency that a stampede had been ruled out as the cause of death as there were ""no visible wounds"".

"Mason: G7 leaders meet amid political pressures at homeAmid the grinning photo ops of the G7 world leaders, there are domestic differences to contend with.UK Politics","Amid the beauty of the Bavarian mountains and fields, a fundamental truth is immediately striking at this G7 Summit. When a collection of democracies gather, each national leader is flexing to the political and public mood back home, subtly, sometimes strikingly different from one country to the next. The G7 has an opponent in Russia, whose leader faces no such democratic pressure, and is acutely savvy about the weaknesses, as he might see them, of the western model of governance. Amid the security and the choreography, the grip and grin photo ops and the alpine backdrops, the differences of emphasis between the G7 countries, and their desire to project a collective impression to the wider world is worth exploring in turn. Firstly, those internal differences. The prime minister, as we know, arrives here with domestic political issues having chased him north from the Commonwealth summit in Rwanda. It'll probably chase him to the summit of the Nato defence alliance in Spain in a few days too. He is out of the country for a week, while Conservatives back home from the cabinet speculate privately about his future. But other leaders face domestic political pressures too. Take President Emmanuel Macron of France, for instance. A few months after being re-elected as president, he's lost control of the French National Assembly. The British government feel Germany and in particular France are feeling the domestic political pressure of some of the consequences of the Ukraine war - not least spiralling prices. After Boris Johnson's meeting with President Macron, Downing Street told us: ""The prime minister stressed any attempt to settle the conflict now will only cause enduring instability and give Putin licence to manipulate both sovereign countries and international markets in perpetuity."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss co-wrote something very similar, with her Ukrainian counterpart, in the Sunday Telegraph. Publicly, No 10 insists President Macron has done ""huge amounts"" to support Ukraine, but privately there is concern Paris is losing appetite for the long-term slog of the war, and its costs. Beyond the internal G7 diplomacy, there are then the efforts being made together to reassure countries beyond the group, some of whom blame western sanctions as much as Russian aggression for rising prices, as my colleague James Landalewrites about here. Argentina, India and South Africa are among the other countries invited here to join discussions. I'm told that tomorrow a quad of key countries will meet here - the United States, France, Germany and the UK. Those around the prime minister talk about the need for a ""gear change"" on sanctions, and they believe the new ones on Russian gold contribute to this, and a ""game changer"" on military support, which will be talked about more at the Nato summit in Madrid. Getting there, this week and beyond, will require persuasion and patience. And it comes at a cost.

The world reacts to US abortion ruling,"Anti-abortion protest in Rome last month The US Supreme Court's overturning of the constitutional right to abortion is being felt in countries across the world, where activists on both sides of the debate have been explaining what it means to them. Our correspondents in Italy, El Salvador, India, Ireland and Canada report on the reverberations being felt where they are. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Rome In 1978, five years after Roe v Wade, Italy legalised abortion with Law 194. And while it is not the same lightning rod political issue here, the rise of a new hard-right conservative politics, ever closer to the Catholic church, has brought it back into focus - and the US Supreme Court's decision is reverberating in Italy too. From the political left and centre, there's been a chorus of condemnation and alarm. Emma Bonino, a leftist former foreign minister who helped pass Law 194, said it showed the risk in Italy of moving backwards and of ""losing achievements that had seemed permanent."" But on the right, some feel galvanised. ""A great victory"", declared Simone Pillon from the far-right League, adding that he hoped Italy and Europe would follow suit. However, his party leader, Matteo Salvini, was notably more nuanced, stating that he believes ""in the value of lifeâ¦ but on pregnancy, the last word belongs to the woman"" - perhaps a recognition that the majority of Italians say they still support the right to abort. ANALYSIS:Why this was a seismic day in America NEXT:What happens now Roe v Wade has been overturned? BACKGROUND:What is Roe v Wade ruling on abortion? While it's unlikely abortion would be restricted here, Law 194 allowed for conscientious objection by doctors - and across the country, around 70% of medics now refuse to perform the procedure. In some regions, it's 90%. With the Vatican in its backyard, Italy is often behind the curve on some social issues, such as LGBT rights. There is pride among many that abortion was fought for, and enshrined in law, decades ago. But it is for some a raw nerve - and the US decision will touch that. By Emma Vardy, BBC Ireland correspondent Across the island of Ireland news of the US Supreme Court ruling has triggered a swift and passionate response. The issue stirs deep emotions here where abortion was only relatively recently decriminalised. Many vocal Irish campaign groups and activists still exist on both sides. ""The world continues to watch America become unrecognisable,"" wrote Dr Jennifer Cassidy on Twitter, a university lecturer who was in Dublin in 2018 when jubilant crowds celebrated as the Republic of Ireland voted to decriminalise abortion. Many on the pro-choice side have been reliving memories of that day, now expressing their horror at what they are witnessing in the US. The story of Savita Halappanavar, who died of sepsis in Ireland in 2012, because she was not allowed a termination, is now being reshared widely in Ireland, by people warning Americans to prepare themselves for many similar deaths. Protest in Dublin hails Savita Halappanavar who died in 2012 A ""shameful decision"" said Grainne Taggart of Amnesty International, who has fought hard for abortion rights in Northern Ireland. But campaigners who were devastated by the legalisation of abortion on the island of Ireland have been reinvigorated. ""Its a bit of a wake-up for us here,"" said Bernie Smyth, one of Northern Ireland's most prominent anti-abortion campaigners. ""There's a lot to be learnt from what is happening in the US."" ""My personal hope for the future is that we too will one day reverse the legislation. I think the movement in the US have been very wise. This brings a lot of hope, and the battle goes on."" By Will Grant, BBC News, San Salvador, El Salvador Just as they felt the tide was beginning to turn on abortion in Latin America, many reproductive rights' campaigners now fear the worst following the Supreme Court ruling on Roe V Wade. ""This will embolden the most conservative groups in our countries who consistently deny women rights"", says Mariana Moisa, a leading pro-abortion rights' activist in El Salvador where abortion is banned in all cases including where the mother's life is endangered, rape or incest. ""The denial of the human rights of women and girls being forced to bear children who are the product of abuse"" already disproportionately affects the poorest in society, she says. Meanwhile, anti-abortion politicians who control El Salvador's parliament have welcomed the move and insist that their position on abortion remains the dominant view in the Americas. While the Supreme Court was solely concerned with the law in US states, Washington continues to exercise a huge influence over Central America. Ms Moisa says the message being sent out by this ruling is stark. ""It's lamentable. A retrograde step which only goes to illustrate the contempt and lack of concern which exists around the world for women."" By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Toronto Canada doesn't often like to butt its nose in its neighbour's - and largest trading partner's - business. But when the Supreme Court overruled Roe v Wade, Canada's progressive-leaning prime minister, Justin Trudeau, did not mince words, calling it a ""devastating setback"" and ""horrific"" for women. ""Quite frankly, it's an attack on everyone's freedoms and rights,"" Mr Trudeau said from the Commonwealth summit in Kigali, Rwanda. Abortion has been de-criminalised in Canada since 1983, but access is not a guaranteed right. In many areas, women have to drive for hours to get abortions. Inside a US abortion clinic on its last day Elation and despair outside US Supreme Court There are many anti-abortion Canadians, but the issue has not been politicised to the same degree as it has south of the border. RightNow, a Canadian anti-abortion organisation, tweeted that it was a ""truly historic day for our friends in the United States"". By Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Gender justice activists in India have described the ruling as ""a huge step back for women's rights"" and say it's guided by ""Victorian morality"". Dr Veena JS, activist and forensic medicine professor who teaches medical ethics to doctors, says the Roe v Wade ruling will impact women's reproductive rights not just in the US but have a cascading effect around the world too. ""America is generally a model for the world and I fear, at some point, India could take a cue from them and bring in a similar legislation,"" she says. ""And we will be forced to raise children we don't want."" This, Dr Veena says, will affect the physical and mental health of women and children. ""Research has shown that post-partum psychosis and depression increases in women who are forced against their will to give birth. The quality of life of these 'unwanted' children will also be poor."" Abortions have been legal in India since 1971, although with conditions, especially to curb female foeticide in a country with an overwhelming preference for sons. But because of a general lack of awareness among women, stigma attached to the topic and doctors' reluctance to perform abortions out of religious or moral beliefs mean a majority of abortions are still held outside of registered medical facilities.

"UK and US to ban imports of Russian goldThe move by the UK, US, Canada and Japan will ""strike at the heart of Putin's war machine"", the UK PM says.Business","The UK, US, Canada and Japan will ban imports of Russian gold in an effort to hit Moscow's ability to fund the war in Ukraine. The UK PM said the move would ""strike at the heart of Putin's war machine"". Gold exports were worth Â£12.6bn ($15.4bn) to Russia in 2021, and the UK says their importance has increased since the invasion as oligarchs rush to buy bullion to avoid sanctions. It comes as the G7 group of the world's richest nations meet in Germany. US President Biden suggested the other G7 nations - Germany, France and Italy - would also join the ban. ""Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia,"" he said in a tweet. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""We need to starve the Putin regime of its funding. The UK and our allies are doing just that."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? G7 face battle for unity as cost of war mounts With London a major global trading hub for gold, the UK government said the move would have a huge impact on President Putin's ability to raise funds. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Western countries have introduced a range of sanctions targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises. The US, European Union, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses so far. The latest measure will mean UK import restrictions will apply to Russian exports worth around Â£13.5bn. The UK said the gold import ban would come into force shortly, with legislation introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks. It will apply to newly mined or refined gold, and does not impact gold previously exported from Russia. There are no plans to extend restrictions to Russian gold purchased legitimately before the import ban was put in place. Discussions at the G7 summit in Bavaria are expected to focus on the international response to the war in Ukraine, as well as soaring prices and the global food crisis.

The bodies were taken to mortuaries, where post-mortem examinations will be carried out. Mr Cele, who had visited the scene and was briefed by the local police, said those who had died were between the ages of 13 and 17 - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The legal minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18. There are reports that people who had gone to the tavern were celebrating the end of school exams. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to families of the victims. ""This tragedy is made even more grave by its occurrence during Youth Month - a time during which we... advocate and advance opportunities for improved socio-economic conditions for the youth of our nation,"" he said in a tweet. Oscar Mabuyane, premier of East Cape Province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Speaking at the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment."" The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday. A provincial safety official told AFP news agency that a stampede had been ruled out as the cause of death as there were ""no visible wounds"". ""Forensic [investigators] will take samples and test to see if there was any poisoning of any sort,"" Unathi Binqose said. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

'Russians said beatings were my re-education',"Like many Ukrainians trying to leave Russian-occupied areas, Andriy was forced to go through a process called filtration Ukrainians who want to leave cities under Russian occupation cannot do so without undergoing a terrifying process known as filtration. Phones are searched, social media accounts scoured. Anything deemed incriminating can lead to beatings, civilians say, and many are forcefully sent to Russia. Andriy watched anxiously as Russian soldiers connected his mobile to their computer, trying to restore some files. Andriy, a 28-year-old marketing officer, was attempting to leave Mariupol. He had deleted everything he thought a Russian soldier could use against him, such as text messages discussing Russia's invasion of Ukraine or photos of the devastation in his city caused by weeks of relentless shelling. But the internet in Mariupol, a once bustling port in southern Ukraine, had been cut off as part of the siege imposed by Russia, and Andriy had not been able to take down some of his posts on social media. He remembered the first days of the war, when he had shared some anti-Russian messages and speeches from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. ""I'm screwed,"" he thought. The soldiers, Andriy said, already had their focus on him. On that day in early May, when he first joined the queues for filtration in Bezimenne, a small village to the east of Mariupol, one of the Russians noticed his beard. The soldier, Andriy said, instantly assumed it was a sign that he was a fighter with the Azov regiment, a former militia in the city which once had links with the far right. ""Is it you and your brigade killing our guys?,"" Andriy was asked. He replied he had never served in the army, he started working directly after graduating, but ""they didn't want to hear it"". As the soldiers went through his phone, they turned to his political views, and asked his opinion of Zelensky. Andriy, cautiously, said Zelensky was ""okay"", and one of the soldiers wanted to know what he meant by that. Andriy told him Zelensky was just another president, not very different from those who had come before, and that in fact, he was not very interested in politics. ""Well,"" the soldier replied, ""you should just say you aren't interested in politics."" They kept Andriy's phone and told him to wait outside. He met his grandmother, mother and aunt, who had arrived with him and had already been given a document that allowed them to leave. A few minutes later, Andriy said, he was ordered to go to a tent where members of Russia's security service, the FSB, were carrying out further checks. Five officers were sitting behind a desk, three wearing balaclavas. They showed Andriy a video he had shared on Instagram of a speech Zelensky had given, from 1 March. With it was a caption written by Andriy: ""A president we can be proud of. Go home with your warship!"" One of the officers took the lead. ""You told us you're neutral to politics, but you support the Nazi government,"" Andriy recalled being told. ""He hit me in the throat. He basically started the beating."" Andriy said the soldiers found out he had shared speeches of President Zelensky after connecting his phone to their computer Like Andriy, Dmytro had his phone confiscated at a checkpoint as he tried to leave Mariupol in late March. Dmytro, a 34-year-old history teacher, said the soldiers came across the word ""ruscist"", a play on ""Russia"" and ""fascist"", in a message to a friend. The soldiers, Dmytro told me, slapped and kicked him, and ""everything [happened] because I used that word."" Dmytro said he was taken, with four other people, to a police station in the village of Nikolsky, also a filtration point. ""The highest-ranking officer punched me four times in the face,"" he said. ""It seemed to be part of the procedure"". His interrogators said teachers like him were spreading pro-Ukrainian propaganda. They also asked what he thought about ""the events of 2014"", the year that Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and started supporting pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. He replied that the conflict was known as the Russo-Ukrainian war. ""They said Russia was not involved, and asked me whether I agreed that it was, in fact, a Ukrainian civil war."" The officers checked his phone again, and this time found a photo of a book which had the letter H in its title. ""We got you!"" the soldiers told Dmytro. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claims his war in Ukraine is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" the country, and the soldiers, Dmytro said, believed he was reading books about Hitler. The next morning, Dmytro was transferred with two women to a prison in Starobesheve, a separatist-controlled village in Donetsk. He counted 24 people in the four-bunk cell. After four days and another detailed interrogation, he was finally released, and eventually reached Ukrainian-held territory. Weeks later, he still does not know what happened to his cell mates. Back inside the tent in Bezimenne, Andriy noticed two other people with their hands tied behind them, who had been left in a corner while the officers paid attention to him. ""They started to beat me way harder,"" Andriy told me, ""everywhere"". At one point, after a blow to the stomach, he felt as if he was about to faint. He managed to sit on a chair. ""I wondered what would be better,"" he said, ""to lose consciousness and fall down or tolerate the pain further."" At least, Andriy thought, he had not been taken somewhere else, away from his family. Ukrainian officials say thousands of people are believed to have been sent to detention centres and camps set up in Russian-controlled areas during filtration. In almost all cases, their relatives do not know where they are being held, or why. ""I [was] very angry about everything,"" Andriy said, ""but, at the same time, I know it could've been much worse."" His mother tried to get into the tent, but was stopped by the officers. ""She was very nervous. She later said they had told her that my 're-education' had started,"" Andriy said, ""and that she shouldn't be worried."" His ordeal, he told me, continued for two and a half hours. He was even forced to make a video saying ""Glory to the Russian army!"", a mockery of ""Slava Ukraini!"", the Ukrainian slogan. The final question, Andriy said, was whether he had ""understood his mistakes"", and ""I obviously answered yes"". As he was being released, officers brought in another man, who had previously served in Ukraine's military and had several tattoos. ""They immediately pushed him to the ground and started to beat him,"" Andriy said. ""They didn't even talk to him."" ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic,"" Andriy said about filtration Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces and Russian-backed separatists have carried out filtration in occupied territories as an attempt to establish residents' possible links with the military, law enforcement and even local government, as the invading forces try to restore services and infrastructure. Men of fighting age are particularly targeted, checked for bruises that could suggest recent use of weapons, such as on the fingers and shoulders. Strip searches are common, witnesses say, including for women. Oleksandra Matviychuk, the head of the Center for Civil Liberties, a Kyiv-based human rights group, said the process, even when not violent, was ""inhuman"". ""There's no military need for this... They're trying to occupy the country with a tool I call 'immense pain of civilian people'. You ask: 'Why so much cruelty? For what?'"" Maksym, a 48-year-old steelworker, said he was forced to strip naked while officers in Bezimenne checked even the seams of his clothes. He was asked whether he was from the Azov regiment or was a Nazi sympathiser - he denied being either - and why he wanted to leave Mariupol. ""I said, 'Actually, it's you who are on Ukrainian soil.'"" One of the officers, who he said were all Russian, reacted by hitting Maksym with the gun butt in his chest. He fell. ""I leaned my head on the ground, holding my ribs. I couldn't get up,"" he said. ""It was very painful to breathe."" He was taken to what he described as a ""cage"", where others were being held. He noticed that one man, a weightlifter, had a tattoo of Poseidon, the Greek god, with a trident. The soldiers, Maksym said, thought it was the Ukrainian coat of arms. ""He explained it to them but they didn't understand."" Those detained in the ""cage"" were given no water or food, and had to urinate in a corner in front of everyone, Maksym told me. At one point, exhausted, he tried to sleep on the ground. An officer came in and kicked him in the back, forcing him to stand. People would be taken to be interrogated and, when they returned, ""you saw the person had been beaten,"" Maksym said. He witnessed a woman in her 40s lying in pain, apparently after being hit in the stomach. A man, who seemed to be around 50, had a bleeding lip and red bruises on his neck. Maksym believed he had been strangled. No-one in the ""cage"" asked or said anything to each other. They were afraid that FSB officers could be disguised as prisoners. After about four or five hours, Maksym was released and allowed to leave Mariupol. Days later, he reached safety in Ukrainian-controlled territory, and went to a hospital to treat the persistent pain in his chest. The diagnosis: four broken ribs. Yuriy Belousov, who leads the Department of War at the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office, said his team had received allegations of torture and even killings during filtration. ""[It seems to be] a Russian policy which was designed in advance, and pretty well prepared,"" he told me. ""It's definitely not just a single case or [something] done by a local military guy."" He acknowledged it was difficult to verify the cases, or estimate the scale of the violence. The Ukrainian authorities are unable to carry out investigations in occupied territories and most victims remain reluctant to share their stories, concerned that relatives in Mariupol could be targeted if their identity is exposed. Vadym, 43, who used to work at a state-owned company in Mariupol, said he was tortured in Bezimenne in March. Separatist soldiers had questioned his wife after finding out she had ""liked"" the Ukrainian army page on Facebook, and restoring a receipt on her phone of a donation she had made to them. ""I tried to stand up for her,"" he said, ""but was knocked down."" He got up, but was beaten once more. A pattern, he said, that happened again and again. When Russian soldiers realised where he worked, they took Vadym to a different building. There, Vadym said, separatist soldiers asked him ""stupid things"" and started to beat him. ""They used electricity. I almost died. I fell and choked on my dental fillings, which had come out from my teeth,"" Vadym said. He vomited and fainted. ""They were furious. When I recovered consciousness, they told me to clean everything up and continued to give me electric shocks."" The torture, Vadym said, only stopped after Russian officers intervened. They carried out another round of questioning before finally freeing him. As Vadym left the building, he saw a young woman, who had been identified during the process as a court clerk, being carried out. ""A plastic bag was put on her head, and her hands were tied,"" Vadym said. ""Her mother was on her knees, begging for her daughter not to be taken away."" Vadym's release came with a condition: he would have to go to Russia. About 1.2 million people in Ukraine, including thousands of Mariupol residents, have been sent to Russia against their will since the invasion began in February, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia denies it is carrying out a mass deportation, which would constitute a war crime under international humanitarian law, and says it is simply helping those who want to go. Ukraine rejects this claim. Some of those sent to Russia have managed to escape to other countries and even return to Ukraine. How many, remains unclear. Vadym, with the help of his friends, moved to another European country - he did not want to reveal the exact location. He had lost some of his vision, he told me, and doctors said this was a result of head injuries from the beating. ""I feel better now, but rehabilitation will take a long time."" I asked him what he thought about filtration. ""They separate families. People are being disappeared,"" he said. ""It's pure terror."" Russia's defence ministry did not respond to several requests for comment on the allegations. The Russian government has previously denied it is carrying out war crimes in Ukraine. Andriy said his mother was told by a Russian soldier that he was going through ""re-education"" Andriy and his family have now settled in Germany, after also having been forced to go to Russia. Looking back, he believes the occupying forces seemed to be using filtration to show their ""absolute power"". Soldiers, he said, acted as if it was a ""type of entertainment"", something to ""satisfy their own ego"". I told him about another Ukrainian I had met, a 60-year-old retired engineer called Viktoriia. A soldier found out she had added a Ukrainian flag to her profile photo on Facebook, she said, and the message ""Ukraine above all."" He pointed his gun at her, she told me, and threatened: ""I'll put you in the basement until you rot!"" He then kicked her. Viktoriia struggled to understand why he had acted like that. ""What did I do? What right did they have?"" Andriy said he could not explain such behaviour. ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic."" But, he said, ""there's no logic"".

What's the mood after the by-elections?,"This video can not be played Watch: Moments that made this by-election historic This is an important mood-making week for our biggest political parties. Encounters with the electorate always mould the mojo of our political leaders. For when you are in the popularity business, the verdict of voters, however geographically piecemeal, can't be ignored. But there can be other catalysts that prompt a smile or a frown, and both the Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party each face one of those moments in the coming days too. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Starmer hails great result for Labour in Wakefield But let's take a look first at the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The result in Wakefield in West Yorkshire was less surprising but more important than the one in Devon. Why? Because if Labour are to win a general election they need to take seats, and lots of them, from the Conservatives. The party is pleased that, were themargin of Labour's victory there to be repeated at a general election(a big if, as they acknowledge, as by-elections are not about electing a government), they would have won a majority. They take issue with the election guru Sir John Curtice's analysis. Professor Sir John, of Strathclyde University, said the result implied there was still a question mark about the electorate's enthusiasm for Labour, as opposed to distaste for the Conservatives, given the decline in the Conservative vote was more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote. Senior figures point out that plenty assumed when Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader that such was the electoral mountain the party faced,  he would never himself make it to Downing Street, but instead make it possible for his successor to do so. ""The mantra in the office is we have to be Kinnock and Blair,"" says one source, a reference to Lord Kinnock's rebuilding of the party and Sir Tony's delivery of an election victory. They believe such a victory is now seen as doable. Another source recently described the Starmer project thus far as ""climbing out of the grave"" dug for them by former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Parts one and two of the plan were detoxifying their brand, as they saw it, and portraying the government as inept. They feel they have done both these things. The third stage, which plenty of figures including influential ones in the shadow cabinet are getting impatient to see, is the case for why people should vote Labour. Theinvestigation by Durham Constabulary into alleged Covid law breaking by Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Raynerhas hamstrung that and it won't begin in earnest until - if - they are cleared. Planning is under way for the party conference in the autumn; after last year's focus on internal Labour machinations, this year's will be about their pitch to the country. What, then, of the Liberal Democrats? They, in the words of one, are ""super chipper"" this weekend. Little wonder; a third whopping win against the Conservatives in a by-election a year. Conservatives have been known to privately describe Lib Dems as the 'yellow peril', a backhanded compliment to their by-election savvy, energy and ruthlessness. The coalition years doused their brand in a political poison for many. The antidote of time appears to have washed much of that away. They are still parliamentary tiddlers - 14 MPs out of 650, just 2% of the Commons. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey joined his newest MP Richard Foorde to celebrate his win But they could play an outsized role in the politics of the next few years, injecting fear into the Conservative psyche about their potential capacity to wipe out swathes of Tory MPs. One thing the Lib Dems are irritated by is the grumbles of Conservatives, most notably the Health Secretary Sajid Javid this weekend, about talk of a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour to work together to eject Tory MPs. As Sir John Curtice has said, there appears to be a growing willingness of voters to vote for whichever party locally is best able to beat the Conservatives. Both Labour and the Lib Dems insist there is no deal, there is no pact, it's parties focusing on where they can win. Lib Dem sources also point out they couldn't possibly have won and won so big in three previously rock solid Conservative seats without luring former Tory voters to them, including, especially in Tiverton and Honiton, plenty who voted Leave. Next: the Conservatives. It's 30 years since a party lost two by elections on the same day. The last time it happened, it was the Conservatives again who were on the receiving end of two chunks of the electorate's ire. On 7 November 1991, they lost Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal Democrats and Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire to Labour. And what happened at the general election six months later? The Conservatives won them both back. The idea that by-elections can be a psephological quirk â and they can be â and exaggerate a party's popularity or otherwise, is what Tories cling to this weekend. Boris Johnson told the BBC a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" But plenty of Boris Johnson's internal critics think the electorate's judgement on the prime minister's character is set and little can change that. His supporters hope his previous bounce-back-ability has at least one more boing in it. Finally, then, to the DUP and the SNP. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are refusing to go into devolved government at Stormont. They say they won't go back into power sharing until the part of the Brexit deal called theNorthern Ireland Protocolis radically altered, removing that sense from many unionists that it was unpicking the stitches that hold the UK together, the overarching fear of their political creed. On Monday, the proposed change in the law that could ditch chunks of the Protocol will be debated in the Commons. Some are outraged at what they see as the government intentionally breaking international law. Ministers insist it won't do that. What we shouldn't expect is rapid movement from the DUP. They feel they've been repeatedly let down by Boris Johnson and they have a mandate to ensure they get the Protocol sorted, as they see it, before returning to Stormont. Second reading of protocol bill set for next week DUP 'in denial' about financial situation in NI Debating the Protocol Bill won't be enough to resolve that impasse. And so to the Scottish National Party. The first thing which always bears repeating is how, 15 years into government at Holyrood, they continue to be the colossus of Scottish politics; everyone else a shrimp in comparison. It doesn't insulate them from problems; their Westminster leader Ian Blackford has faced calls to resign over his party's handling of a sexual harassment complaint. This video can not be played Ian Blackford apologises to victim and says Patrick Grady should ""reflect"" on behaviour Not only has it raised questions about Mr Blackford's judgement in the eyes of his critics, but proven there is at least one mole within his ranks who has recorded and leaked what was meant to be a private meeting. On Tuesday, party leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will set out how she plans to ""unlock the door to another independence referendum"", as one figure put it to me. Exactly how they do that, with Boris Johnson refusing to countenance one, will be interesting. It'll be a big moment at the core of the SNP's very reason for being - and so itself a mood-maker for them and Scottish politics more broadly.

"Now not the time to give up on Ukraine, PM to say","Speaking at the G7 summit, Boris Johnson praised the support for Ukraine from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz Boris Johnson has said leaders must be honest about rising costs due to the Ukraine war, but said the price of Russia succeeding was ""far higher"". He said world leaders understand they must remain united with Kyiv despite fears of war fatigue. Allies were ""making the sacrifice"" over rising food and energy costs because ""the price of freedom is worth paying,"" he said. The PM is at the G7 summit as he faces pressure over his leadership at home. After leaving Germany, Mr Johnson will head to Madrid for a Nato summit before flying home on Thursday - his first return to the UK since the Conservatives lost two by-elections. He has rejected calls to resign, saying he is focused on the cost of living, the economy and ""standing up to violence and aggression"" in Ukraine. Speaking in the Bavarian Alps where the G7 summit is being held, Mr Johnson said leaders would be discussing how to keep the coalition of support together ""at a time when realistically there is going to be fatigue among populations and politicians"". He said Nato and the G7 continue to be ""solid"" in their stand against the invasion by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but to protect that unity they must have ""really, really honest discussions"" about the pressures each nation is under. G7 face battle for unity as cost of war mounts Zelensky addresses music fans as Glastonbury opens New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry The prime minister gave the example of Germany, which is takingemergency measures after Russia cut gas supplies, saying: ""They're making the effort, they're making the sacrifice. That's because they see the price of freedom is worth paying."" He said the G7 and Nato were defending the principle that a free, sovereign country should not be ""violently invaded and have its boundaries changed by force"". ""The price of backing down, of allowing President Putin to hack off parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest - that price will be far, far higher and everyone here understands that,"" Mr Johnson said. The G7 leaders have travelled to the Bavarian Alps for the annual summit In an interview with CNN on Sunday Mr Johnson was asked about surviving a confidence vote and his party's by-election defeats and insisted the scrutiny he had faced had been a good thing. The prime minister questioned whether Russia's invasion of Ukraine would have happened if Mr Putin had faced similar dissent and had ""the 1922 committee on his case"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to address the G7 countries - the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - on Monday. Ukraine is urgently asking for more financial help due to fears it could run out of funding by the autumn without further support. Mr Johnson is due to pledge Â£429m to Ukraine in guarantees for World Bank lending, as its fight against the Russian invasion drags on. The loan guarantees provided by the UK will take its package of economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine to Â£1.5bn. The British government feels Germany and in particular France are feeling the domestic political pressure of some of the consequences of the Ukraine war - not least spiralling prices. After Boris Johnson's meeting with President Macron, Downing Street told us: ""The prime minister stressed any attempt to settle the conflict now will only cause enduring instability and give Putin licence to manipulate both sovereign countries and international markets in perpetuity."" Publicly, No 10 insists President Macron has done ""huge amounts"" to support Ukraine, but privately there is concern Paris is losing appetite for the long-term slog of the war, and its costs. Those around the prime minister talk about the need for a ""gear change"" on sanctions, and they believe the new ones on Russian gold contribute to this, and a ""game changer"" on military support, which will be talked about more at the Nato summit in Madrid. Getting there, this week and beyond, will require persuasion and patience. And it comes at a cost. Read more on this here. The prime minister told CNN he thought Brexit had allowed the UK to better assist Ukraine in defending itself against Russia. ""I don't think that we would have been out in front as the first European country to arm the Ukrainians,"" he said. At the summit on Sunday, Mr Johnson had talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, where the prime minister was said to have stressed that any attempt to settle the conflict now would only give Mr Putin ""licence to manipulate sovereign countries"". He also had a meeting with Canada's Justin Trudeau, where Mr Johnson said Ukraine was ""on a knife-edge"" and needed defensive capabilities, training and intelligence to tip the balance in its favour. The Canadian and UK prime ministers discussed what Ukraine needed to gain the advantage in the conflict Ahead of the summit, Mr Johnson warned that Ukrainians should not be encouraged to ""settle for a bad peace"" where they were ""invited to give up chunks of their territory in return for a ceasefire"". He said: ""Ukraine can win and it will win. But they need our backing to do so. Now is not the time to give up on Ukraine."" Boris Johnson will also urge Western allies to increase sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies. Mr Johnson said the UK, Canada, the US and Japan were banning imports of Russian gold, saying the move will ""directly hit Russian oligarchs and strike at the heart of Putin's war machine"". The UK government says gold is a major Russian export, worth Â£12.6bn to its economy in 2021 and increasingly used by the country's oligarchs to try to avoid the impact of sanctions. At the Nato summit, the prime minister will also push for increased defence spending across the alliance and support Sweden and Finland's bids to join the organisation. Asked if he thought there was going to be a global recession, the prime minister said the world was facing ""a lot of headwinds"" due to rising prices linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said that it was pointless to focus ""on how bad things might get"" and that he believed things would get eventually better and inflation would slow.

Six takeaways from the by-elections,"A woman passes a polling station on horseback in Uffculme, Devon There has been a resounding double defeat for the Conservatives after the Lib Dems took the south-western rural stronghold of Tiverton and Honiton and Labour made a decisive return to power in the northern seat of Wakefield. Our South West political editorMartyn Oatesand Yorkshire political editorJames Vincenthave been following the candidates and speaking to voters in the two very different communities over the past few weeks. This is what they have learned. 1/ Low wages and high house prices squeezing voters On the face of it, the South West is a typical rural Conservative stronghold - and from the 2015 general election until this by-election electors across the peninsula returned a Conservative MP in all but two constituencies. But Devon and Cornwall also had serious socio-economic problems even before the cost of living crisis hit. Government funding has singled out Cornwall for special treatment. But research by Devon County Council shows this constituency is one of several areas of Devon where productivity per head is equal to or poorer than Cornwall's - without corresponding government recognition. Low wages contrast with soaring house prices. Spiralling fuel prices are a particular concern in highly-rural constituencies like this, where a car is often seen as essential to live and work. Getting the voice of the rural South West heard in Westminster has always been a challenge - and some think that has not become easier with the present government's anxiety to help its new friends in the North. Follow our live coverage of the by-elections fallout 2/ Farmers on collision course with government Agriculture shapes the whole landscape of this constituency, from Exmoor to the Blackdown Hills to the Jurassic Coast. And the government has put itself on a collision course with the farming community in at least three key policy areas. Farmers say they are once again ploughing crops back into the fields because they cannot source enough foreign labour under the government's strict new immigration rules. Livestock farmers - who predominate here - are also extremely worried about the new trade deals ministers have struck with Australia and New Zealand, fearing they will be undercut by a flood of cheap foreign meat. Even the government's own analysis found the agricultural sector would suffer as a result. And the ending of the old EU-style farm subsidies is especially feared somewhere like this where the typically small, family farm has relied on them to stay in business. 3/ Prime minister's personality looms large Boris Johnson's barnstorming celebrity status and his unconventional approach to high office always risked being a double-edged sword, though many saw it as the trump card which won the Conservatives their huge majority in 2019. Two-and-half years into his premiership and with the partygate row and the confidence vote fresh in voter's minds, the PM's personality loomed perhaps unusually large in this by-election. The candidates for the three big parties all brandished impressive local credentials.  But another local - the ex-MP whose resignation triggered this by-election - was arguably the other big political personality here, albeit one with no active involvement. The enduring affection for Neil Parish, a farmer himself and widely credited for working hard for this farming community, is perhaps a reminder that strong local candidates can also help make or break the political weather. FollowMartyn on Twitter,external 1/ Fans don't back beleaguered clubs Many people in Wakefield are Leeds United fans. They will always support Leeds, but might not go to games if the team is not doing very well. That's potentially what happened here with the Conservatives. People who are natural Conservative voters may have just stayed at home rather than voting. The low turnout did them no favours and just like fans of a beleaguered club they perhaps showed their views by not showing them at all. For football clubs, the way they get out of that rut is by changing the manager. 2/ Prime minister's no-show may have had an impact Maybe leader visits do matter in election campaigns. Sir Keir Starmer was in Wakefield a number of times. Boris Johnson was due last week - but went to Ukraine instead. As usual, you can read this both ways. Maybe the Conservatives did not want the PM in front of microphones at difficult times. But it also might have looked like they were not taking the by-election here seriously. Also, those nearby MPs that backed the PM in the confidence vote, did so in part because he was seen as a vote winner. He helped get some MPs their first-ever job in Westminster. But in Yorkshire today, he's not a vote winner. Will he ever come to Yorkshire as PM again? 3/ Are voters in the North returning to Labour? Labour can take back ""red wall"" seats. I mean, no-one here calls it the red wall, but Labour thinks they can grab them back. The Conservatives think this election was called for such a specific reason it proves nothing. Labour were favourites, but the big question was how big they could win. A narrow victory could potentially have been shrugged off by the Conservatives and seen as Labour voters not taking to Sir Keir. Nearly 5,000 is big enough for Labour to see it as evidence people are coming back to them. But there is a big difference between a by-election and a general election.
