Chelsea paid Â£150.8m by Premier League,"Chelsea won the title - and received almost Â£151m from the Premier League Chelsea were paid Â£150.8m by the Premier League after winning the 2016-17 title - 50% more than the top earners in 2015-16. The 2016-17 season was the first of thelatest TV dealand saw a total of almost Â£2.4bn paid to the 20 clubs - up from Â£1.6bn last season. Bottom club Sunderland got Â£93.471m - more than the Â£93.219m 2015-16 winners Leicester pocketed the previous season. The figures are based on broadcast and commercial deals plus prize money. Funds from the Premier League's central commercial deals and overseas broadcast rights are shared equally - as is half of the domestic broadcast income. A quarter is paid out in prize money based on each club's league position and the other quarter in ""facility fees"" for each game broadcast on UK television. Arsenal were the top earners in 2015-16 with Â£100.9m  - but only the three relegated sides of Hull, Middlesbrough and Sunderland were paid less than that figure in 2016-17. The ratio between the highest and lowest totals paid by the Premier League to its clubs in 2016-17 was 1.61 to 1, the lowest among Europe's top leagues, which means the Premier League is more equal when it comes to sharing revenue than its rivals. The Premier League also paid out nearly Â£220m to Aston Villa, Cardiff, Fulham, Newcastle, Norwich, QPR, Reading and Wigan in parachute payments. Villa, Newcastle and Norwich - the relegated sides in 2016 - got almost Â£41m each.

Can Agassi bring back 'warrior' Djokovic?,"This video can not be played Djokovic 'inspired' by new coach Agassi French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May- 11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Andre Agassi has attracted as many camera lenses as Novak Djokovic in the opening days of this year's French Open, but the question remains whether this is a fleeting glimpse or the long-term return of one of the game's greats. The 47-year-old Las Vegan beganworking with Djokovicvia phone calls to Madrid and Rome last month, and took up coaching duties in person last week in Paris. There is no clear idea yet of how long the relationship will last. ""That's a question for him, to be honest,"" was all Djokovic would say on the subject before the tournament. What we do know is that Agassi is scheduled to leave Paris at the end of the first week to carry out prior engagements, and there is no clue yet as to when, or if, he will be back in Team Djokovic. ""I will be very surprised if this relationship is going over the US Open,"" said Fabrice Santoro, a former rival of Agassi now commentating at Roland Garros. ""I think it's going to be a very short relation between Andre and Novak,"" the Frenchman told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Andre Agassi knows the game very well, he loves the game, he likes Novak, but it's not his life at the moment. ""He has his own life at home with his foundation, with his family, and I'm not sure he's happy to spend much time in the locker room."" Agassi expects to be coaching Djokovic at Wimbledon French Open live scores and schedule Victory at Roland Garros last year saw Djokovic became only the eighth man in history to win all four of Grand Slams It was in Paris 12 months ago that Djokovic finally cemented his place among the very best by completing thecareer Grand Slam,and holding all four major titles at once - something that has eluded Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But with 12 Grand Slam titles to his name and seemingly set to dominate for the foreseeable future, the Serb's form deserted him. ""I think Novak needs to be back as a warrior, like he was a few months ago,"" said Santoro. ""It's not like 10 years ago - when he won the French Open last year he was not giving one free point to the opponent, he was sliding all over Paris to win a point. You could see in his eyes how big his ambition was. He's lost that."" ""Private issues"" contributed to Djokovic'searly exit at Wimbledon,he later revealed, while a wrist injury curbed hopes of a quick return to form. But by his own remarkable standards, the fact that he has since lost his grip on three of those Slams and seen the number one ranking go to Andy Murray is little short of a disaster. ""Shock therapy"" was what he felt necessary, and it came with the surprise announcement late last year that he was parting ways not only with 'super coach' Boris Becker after three years, but his entire team, including long-time coach and confidante Marian Vajda. ""All these beautiful memories we shared with each other on and off the court cannot be forgotten just like that,"" said Djokovic. ""We are still very close."" Djokovic won six Grand Slam titles over three years with Becker, and all 12 since starting work with Vajda in 2006. The Serb's employment of Becker in 2013 was seen by many as a response to the success Andy Murray had after taking on another legend of the past in Ivan Lendl. But even in his current, second coaching spell, Lendl is likely to spend up to 18 weeks of the year working with Murray, with Jamie Delgado alongside the Scot throughout the season. ""I think Andre Agassi's help could be enough if Marian Vajda was still there, but he's not,"" Santoro said of the fledgling Djokovic arrangement. ""So Novak needs someone to replace Vajda first, and then find a super coach like Andre. ""I know that if Andy Murray was travelling only a few weeks a year with Ivan Lendl, but without Jamie Delgado, he would be in trouble. This is the situation now with Novak."" Murray himself was a huge Agassi fan growing up and once discussed working with the American, but it never came to a formal offer. ""He was always really, really nice to me, which is great,"" said Murray. ""I'm sure he'll help Novak as well. I'm not sure exactly what their deal is or the situation is, but having someone with that much experience around can only help."" Djokovic is currently just working with his brother, Marko, a former professional but with no coaching credentials, and Pepe Imaz, a former world number 146 who now runs a tennis academy that preaches a philosophy of love, peace and meditation. ""I'm not convinced that this person helps Novak Djokovic a lot,"" said Santoro. ""Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. On court, for sure not."" For all the scrutiny that his relationship with Imaz has come under, the lack of a settled fitness trainer and physio is incongruous for a player who wrote a book on the value of physical and mental well-being. ""I have certain people and methods that I have been trying out lately,"" said Djokovic on Monday. ""I am working on something, for sure, but still not ready to be shared."" Andre Agassi kisses the trophy after defeating Todd Martin during the final of the US Open in 1999 So what can Agassi bring that will rejuvenate and enhance the Djokovic game? Djokovic turned 30 a few weeks ago, and Agassi won two of his eight Grand Slam titles in his 30s. He also returned from the depths of 141 in the world in 1997 to regain the number one spot and complete the career Grand Slam in 1999 - a mountainous challenge compared to Djokovic's relatively minor slide. Technical changes are rarely the major issue when elite players call upon greats of the past, and Djokovic is sure to look more for emotional support from Agassi, with neither man averse to a bout of introspection. ""On the first day we had two practice sessions, and then we had a very, very long conversation in the evening,"" the Serb said of their first day together in Paris. Becker, the man who used to provide that support, gave Agassi a very public welcome to the role in the stands of Philippe Chatrier Court during Djokovic's opening match at the French Open. ""I think it's an excellent choice,"" Becker told the BBC. ""Andre's personality fits with Novak's. ""Ideally you don't want to start a new relationship at a Grand Slam because you have to get to know each other but that was their decision, so I wish them luck. ""Ideally you have to spend a lot of time together - even in smaller tournaments to really get to know each other and trust each other - but it is what it is and hopefully successful.""

Why I failed to catch Canada's worst serial killer,"Ten years ago, the trial of Canada's most prolific serial killer opened in Vancouver. Det Con Lorimer Shenher had long suspected the man in the dock, who eventually admitted to nearly 50 murders, but Shenher's attempts to question him had been hindered by red tape. He is still haunted by his failure. Lorimer Shenher had been working in his new job as head of Vancouver's Missing Persons Unit for only two days when an anonymous caller gave him a name - the name of a man who could be responsible for the disappearance of women from the city's Downtown Eastside district. It was July 1998 and Shenher had been tasked with finding out what had happened to 17 women missing from the district, also known as the ""low-track"", because it was where people went to buy cheap sex. All the missing women were sex workers and drug users, and many were from Canada's indigenous population. Shenher entered the name he had been given, Willie Pickton - or Robert William Pickton - into the police database. He saw immediately that his suspect had form. Earlier that year, charges had been dropped against the 49-year-old pig farmer for imprisoning and stabbing a sex worker, almost fatally. Pickton's farm in Port Coquitlam outside the city of Vancouver The caller said he had been told women's handbags, identity cards and bloody clothing could be seen at Pickton's farm. And he said he had listened himself to Pickton making disturbing jokes. ""Pickton had a meat grinder he would talk about,"" says Shenher. ""He would tell his friends, 'If you ever need to dispose of a bodyâ¦'"" Working out whether Pickton had anything to do with the disappearances would be a straightforward case of issuing a search warrant and bringing him in for questioning, Shenher thought. ""My mantra was you have to either rule him in or rule him out,"" he says. But in fact it would be another four years before officers finally searched Pickton's property - on an unrelated charge - and by that time at least another 14 women had been murdered. Many of Pickton's victims were from Canada's marginalised indigenous community A forensic search of Pickton's farm eventually revealed the DNA of 33 women in various buildings, freezers and machines. As he had boasted, the pig farmer had disposed of his victims in his meat grinder. Others he had fed to his pigs. He later confessed to an undercover officer that he was one short of hitting his target of 50 kills. So why did it take so long to catch him? Lorimer Shenher dressed as a sex worker for an undercover assignment Shenher began his police career in the early 1990s as Lorraine Shenher - an athletic, hard-working 27-year-old who achieved one of the highest scores ever in the Vancouver Police Department selection process. He has since undergone gender reassignment, changing his name from Lorraine to Lorimer. For one of his first assignments he worked undercover in the Downtown Eastside. Dressed in a short skirt, he would wait on street corners for men to solicit him for sex so he could arrest them. The experience gave Shenher an insight into the brutality sex workers routinely experienced. Clients could be violent - one threatened to kill him, another tried to abduct him at gunpoint. He also noticed that police officers who should have been protecting the women often ignored their complaints. At this time, he had a unique perspective on what he saw happening around him. ""I felt I was a man observing the situation. But also, living as a woman myself, I couldn't put up with the oppression and sexism the women faced,"" he says. ""I had a lot of anger around it."" Sarah de Vries A few years later, Downtown Eastside residents began to report that women were going missing. One, a young drug user and sex worker called Sarah de Vries, described her fears in her diary. ""Am I next?"" she wrote in December 1995. ""Is he watching me now? Stalking me like a predator and its prey. Waiting, waiting for some perfect spot, time or my stupid mistake. How does one choose a victim? ""Good question. If I knew that, I would never get snuffed."" In April 1998, Sarah herself disappeared. She was the 17th person on Shenher's list when he was appointed to the Missing Person's Unit. Several officers within the Vancouver Police Department had already begun to suspect a serial killer was at work. One of them was Det Insp Kim Rossmo, who had recently completed doctoral research in criminal profiling. ""I went back 20 years using data and typically we would find either no, or just one or two, unfound people in a year,"" he says. ""This number started to grow in 1996, 1997 and 1998. I thought the only explanation for this was a serial murder case."" But when Rossmo took his findings to the officer in charge of the Major Crime Section, he was told that because the women tended to live transient lives, it was more likely they had just drifted away. In fact, this was wrong. Although the women were drug users and poor, they still maintained strong ties to families, friends and their community. But because no-one had found the women's bodies, Rossmo's boss thought no crime had taken place and that in time the women would show up. Each year, dozens of indigenous Canadian women are murdered or disappear never to be seen again. Some end up in a river that runs through the heart of Winnipeg. BBC News App users clickHERE. One of Shenher's first moves was to get in touch with the officer who had arrested and charged Pickton in 1997 for his attack on a sex worker at his farm. Despite the severity of the victim's injuries, prosecutors had dropped the case because she was a heroin addict and it was felt she wouldn't be a convincing witness. Shenher found this decision inexplicable, and his views were shared by the arresting officer - from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) - who helpfully opened his files to Shenher. Because Pickton's farm was outside the city, it fell under the jurisdiction of the RCMP rather than the Vancouver Police Department. In Shenher's view it made sense for the Vancouver police and the Mounties to work together on the case, but at the highest levels of both forces there was resistance to the idea and full co-operation did not begin for several years. Robert Pickton So Shenher returned to his original phone tip-off. The caller had mentioned parties held on Pickton's farm in a barn known locally as Piggy's Palace. These late-night gatherings were popular with biker gangs. Sex and drugs were said to be freely available. A female friend of the informant had attended these parties, and it was she who had seen personal items and bloody clothing that could have belonged to the missing women. Shenher quickly identified this woman but she didn't want to speak to the police. So Shenher proposed an undercover operation to confirm her story, using a female officer who would befriend her and become her confidante. The plan was refused. Instead, Pickton was put under surveillance for three days. But as he did little to arouse suspicion, this was discontinued. ""If these women were from any other walk of life, there would be total outrage, search parties, volunteers, roadblocks,"" says Shenher. ""On a very deep level, a large segment of society and the policing community didn't feel these women were worth searching for and many people questioned whether they even wanted to be found."" Friends and family members hold a vigil for Pickton's victims In May 1999, the Vancouver Police Department established a Missing Persons Review Team with Shenher as the lead investigator. Although this was an improvement from the Missing Persons Unit, it still lacked the resources of a fully-fledged homicide investigation. Then another source came forward with a gruesome story that appeared to identify Pickton as the man killing and disposing of the missing women. The source said he had seen handcuffs in Pickton's bedroom and a special freezer in his barn from which he had been served ""strange meat"", which he believed could have been human. He also spoke of a female friend, whom he named as Lynn Ellingsen, who had gone with Pickton to the Downtown Eastside to help him pick up women. The source said that Ellingsen had told him that she had walked into Pickton's slaughterhouse and had seen what she thought was a female body hanging from a meat hook. Pickton was standing beside it cutting strips of flesh off the body's legs. She said she hadn't realised that human fat was yellow - a detail that lent credibility to her story. At this point Shenher felt he had enough evidence to bring both Ellingsen and Pickton in for questioning, but because Pickton's farm fell under the jurisdiction of the RCMP, it was up to them to take the investigation forward. The RCMP questioned Ellingsen twice, but both times she refused to talk. As for Pickton, Shenher later found that an RCMP officer visited his farm but was told by his brother to ""come back during the rainy season"" because they were too busy working. Four months later, RCMP officers did interview Pickton, who denied killing the women. He consented to a search of his property - but amazingly, this offer was not followed up. By now the number of missing women had risen to 30 and Shenher was beginning to experience physical symptoms brought on by what he regarded as his failure to solve the crimes. He suffered from nightmares and mysterious aches in his body, had trouble eating and developed allergies. ""I've asked myself so many times could I have just physically gone to the farm and tried to execute a search warrant,"" he says. ""The answer, really, is 'No'. It was not my jurisdiction. What failed us was that someone at a very senior level in my force should have approached someone at a very senior level in the RCMP. But it didn't work that way. We didn't get that support."" By the end of 2000, Shenher was exhausted and demoralised. He was beginning to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder so asked to be transferred to a different unit. Then, in January 2001, nearly three years after Shenher had received his first tip-off about Pickton, the RCMP and Vancouver Police Department finally established a joint operation to re-examine the cases of missing and murdered sex workers in the province of British Columbia. Shenher should have been cheered by this. Instead he was depressed. ""What they did was to pull in as many sex offenders and predators that they were aware of in the province and put together a list of 100 men, but not rank them in priority,"" he says. ""So despite having all our information about Pickton, they didn't put him at number one of the suspect list."" It was only in February 2002 when a junior RCMP officer visited Pickton's farm looking for an unlicensed gun and spotted an asthma inhaler bearing the name of one of the missing women, that he was finally arrested. Within hours, the Pickton property became the site of the largest crime scene search in Canadian history. Shenher, when he found out, experienced a wave of contradictory emotions. ""Shock, elation, dread, excitement, sorrow, grief, nausea - it was all there, jumbled up together,"" he says. ""It was a hollow victory and all I could do was cry."" Canadian Minister Carolyn Bennett (far left) and Lorimer Shenher (centre right) with relatives of Pickton's victims In 2007, a court found Pickton guilty of six counts of second-degree murder. There was enough evidence to charge him for a further 20 killings, but prosecutors decided not to proceed because he had already been given the maximum life sentence. Shenher's criticism of the police investigations was shared by family and friends of the victims. In 2010, in response to popular pressure, the government of British Columbia formally announced a Missing Women Commission of Inquiry to look into the police's conduct. It ruled that their investigations suffered from a lack of leadership, describing them as a ""blatant failure"" marked by a deep bias against the poor, often drug-addicted, victims. At the same time it praised certain officers, like Shenher, for striving valiantly to solve the crisis. But what could have been an opportunity for genuine soul-searching about the failures of the province's police and justice systems was wasted, Shenher says. He even accuses the inquiry of suppressing information that would have shed light on why Pickton's farm was not searched earlier. ""My sense was there appeared to be a concerted effort by the provincial government to restrict the amount and type of information that came out,"" he says, though he admits he has no firm evidence to back this suspicion. He now hopes a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, announced last year by the new government of Justin Trudeau, will go further towards answering the question why vulnerable women were so badly let down. ""When a missing woman is viewed as inevitable, where the surge of the investigation is not done at the same level as other investigations and women are dying, then we have to do better,"" the Canadian Minister for Indigenous and Northern Affairs, Carolyn Bennett, told the BBC. Racism and sexism were still a problem within the country's police forces, she added. Shenher is now on long-term medical leave from the police. In 2015 he published a book that details his frustrations with the Pickton investigation, That Lonely Section of Hell. ""People think there's police accountability in Canada,"" he says. ""But there aren't a lot of mechanisms that the government has to oversee their work. ""Without that accountability, I do think a killer like Pickton could get away with it again.""

Female baldness: The long and short of it,"This video can not be played My hair was my ""crowning glory"", says the TV presenter For some people it may be the stuff of nightmares, but baldness isn't just a male problem. Loose Women panellist Nadia Sawalha has posted an emotional video talking about losing her hair at the age of 52. But what is female baldness? The TVpresenter admittedher trademark curls were fake and that she was going through the perimenopause, which is the start of the menopause. She revealed a doctor told her she had the balding gene. Genetic or pattern hair loss - androgenetic alopecia by its proper name - is the most common cause of hair loss in men and women, explained Iain Sallis, director of the Institute of Trichologists. It is inherited from one or both parents and can be triggered by hormones at any time after puberty. Hair is lost at the front, top and the crown of the scalp. The hair loss can vary from thinning to complete baldness. NHS England estimates that around 50% of women over the age of 65 experience female-pattern baldness. There are three main things that can cause this type of hair loss: age, inheritance and the hormone testosterone. Louise French 45, said her hair started thinning in her early 30s. She has since had the affected area covered by a so-called Intralace system - a mesh panel containing human hair which is attached to the scalp for up to 18 months Hayley Jennings, who set up the Yorkshire Hair Loss Clinic, said the majority of her clients were women - especially mothers - in their 30s and 40s with female pattern hair loss. ""This effects one in four women. I have clients who feel embarrassed and unattractive at a time when they should be feeling their most confident,"" she said. It's all about hormone changes, which women can experience after puberty, pregnancy or menopause. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the main hormone responsible. ""After menopuase, the oestrogen is no longer in the body to counter the testosterone,"" said Mr Sallis. According to the Association of Dermatologists, DHT causes a change in the hair follicles on the scalp. The hairs from those follicles become smaller in diameter, shorter in length and lighter in colour until the follicles stop producing hair all together. First Dates star takes off wig on TV BGT's George Sampson has hair transplant In her video, Sawalha admitted her hair ""really started to change"" after she had her children. This post-birth hair loss, Mr Sallis explained, is often experienced three months after birth and is due to shock, a hormone drop and anaemia. The hair often bounces back another three months later, Mr Sallis added. Cheryl Baker - who was in 1980s pop group Bucks Fizz - said she felt ashamed at her hair loss Former TV presenter and 1980s pop star Cheryl Baker began to lose her hair aged 50 when she hit the menopause. Following the death of her mother, it became worse. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""You're in disbelief in the beginning. I have shed a lot of tears. It was such a distressing thing to go through. ""I bought hair pieces, wigs and hats and stopped appearing in public because I felt ashamed of myself."" Sawalha said her hair changed after she had children Sawalha said she sounded ""absolutely pathetic"" for being so upset, but the public response she has received suggests otherwise. Hundreds have since commented on her Facebook video, praising the TV star for her bravery. ""The psychological impact of hair loss is huge,"" said Mr Sallis. One of those who could relate to the video was Catherine Adams, 67, from Southend-on-Sea, who has Alopecia Totalis, which affects her whole body. She lost her hair suddenly aged 20. ""It completely destroys your confidence. You think people are looking at you - you feel a bit freaky,"" she said. Some hair grew back when Catherine was pregnant, but she later lost it again.

Why did 'power surge' hit BA computers?,"BA's recent IT issues caused travel disruption for thousands It is one of the worst IT meltdowns to hit British Airways in recent memory - thousands of passengers had flights disrupted or cancelled at the weekend andthere were chaotic scenesat London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Some travellers arestill waiting to be reunitedwith their luggage, five days later. But what really went wrong? No-one seems to have a firm answer. BA has apologised and blamed a ""power surge"" affecting IT equipment - but many engineers have reacted sceptically to that, pointing out that major firms are meant to have contingency plans in place to avoid disruption when primary systems fail. In a slightly more detailed statement on Wednesday, the airline said a loss of power to a UK data centre was ""compounded"" by a power surge that took out its IT systems. The firm claimed that this did not constitute an IT failure, but rather ""it was an electrical power supply which was interrupted"". An investigation is being carried out and it has been reported that BA's board is set to demand an external inquiry into what happened. BA's statement has failed to satisfy everyone. Several IT workersexpressed doubt,externaland the explanation was labelled ""too simplistic"" by independent defence and aerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon. One of the chief questions that remains unanswered is why a back-up or secondary system did not come into play, even if a power surge affected the main one? This video can not be played Queues at Heathrow airport stretched out of the terminal According to one informed observer, yes - especiallyunder specific circumstances,external. Data centres generally rely on an uninterruptible power supply, or UPS, which is designed to keep providing power to a data centre even if the mains supply fails. This secondary source of power could be based on batteries or a generator running on fuel. As independent IT consultant Marcel van den Berg pointed out, a power surge might have occurred after this secondary power supply failed. Since the UPS might also be designed to protect systems from power surges, without it servers could have been left vulnerable. The Daily Mailhas reported that,externalthe UPS system at Boadicea House, the home of one of BA's data centres near Heathrow, failed on Saturday - though the BBC was unable to confirm this. Practically any piece of equipment could cause a power surge, perhaps due to a fault, for example. But to stick with the UPS line of inquiry, one provider - UPS Systems -notes on its website,external: ""Power surges could be caused by the shut-down of a generator or other industrial motor on the local supply circuit. ""Will cause systems to crash, can cause components to wear and degrade over extended periods."" Even if one data centre fails, many businesses have contingency plans to rely on another Mr van den Berg told the BBC that while a power surge was a valid explanation in principle, it was still unclear why such an event had the catastrophic impact that it did. ""This shouldn't have happened because there should be enough resilience to allow another UPS to take over or a secondary data centre,"" he said. Many large businesses have ""disaster recovery"" plans in place - often these involve the capability to quickly switch operations to a back-up data centre in a completely different location. BA has not revealed whether, for example, it was unable to activate such a facility. BA recently outsourced some of its IT contracts to India's Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and some have questioned whether TCS is to blame. Sunbird and AIT Partnership Group, two firms that have in the past provided software and services to BA's data centres, releaseda statement on Wednesday,externalsaying they ""had no involvement"" with the recent incident. British Airways and TCS both denied that outsourcing jobs had anything to do with the power issues.

Freezing my eggs 'helped me after rape',"Winnie at a red carpet film event before her life changed At the age of 29, Winnie Li was living in London and enjoying a successful career as a film producer, working with film stars like Daniel Craig. She had been to the Oscars where a film she had helped to produce had been nominated. But in 2008, this all came to a halt. One Saturday afternoon, while hiking in Northern Ireland, she was raped. She says it is something she will never forget and the emotional impact stays with her. She told the BBC: ""It was awful. It went from one day, being the person I'd always been, to the next - I felt like I was gutted like a fish, unable to feel any joy or hope. ""My insides were torn out. I was a shell of the person I'd been before."" Her perpetrator - a 15-year-old stranger to whom she had been giving directions - was caught. Winnie then lived in a constant state of anxiety as she waited for the trial. She told the BBC: ""I wasn't feeling emotions. I was just in shock for months."" Winnie suffered severe depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was too scared to go out and had frequent panic attacks. She said: ""I went from being a well-adjusted 29-year-old to feeling like I couldn't function anymore."" This experience affected her dating life. ""All my other friends were continuing on with their careers, personal lives, getting married and having kids. ""And I just wasn't there - I was on a completely different trajectory."" Last year, she found herself single, aged 37. She said: ""I was at that age where people warn you about your fertility dropping off and I wasn't anywhere further on the path to being a mother."" It was this realisation that led her to the decision to freeze her eggs. She had two rounds of egg freezing. And though doctors managed to harvest some viable eggs, there were not enough for her to consider them a viable insurance plan. She said: ""A lot of women describe freezing eggs as an empowering thing. In some ways it's not.  I spent thousands of pounds."" She says she cannot afford a third round. Winnie added: ""It's not necessarily given me hope but it's given me a sense of an option to see if those eggs can become a child."" ""I'll always know I have at least done the best I could in this situation."" Winnie has written a novel, Dark Chapter, inspired by her experience of being raped and the journey to recovery. Winnie has started hiking again She is also working on a doctorate at the London School of Economics, exploring how social media is allowing rape survivors to tell their stories. ""I learn every day from other women how difficult it is for them to put their lives back together. ""But I'm hoping by sharing these stories, we can understand how we can start to heal from this kind of trauma.""

UK's red letter day awaited in Brussels,"Theresa May, pictured in July 2016 on her first trip as PM - to meet Germany's Angela Merkel It's now almost a year since the UK blind-sided the EU by voting to leave the club. Almost 12 whole calendar months. And the sum total of face-to-face negotiations between the two sides to date? Zero. Perfectly explicable in political circles, though baffling for much of the general public. That's why, on both sides of the Channel, 8 June is a red-letter day. Not only is it general election time for the UK, but here in Brussels it means finally starting Brexit negotiations - once the new British government is in place. The first day of EU-UK Brexit talks is expected to be 19 June. And they will focus on who will meet, how often, in which country, discussing which aspects of Brexit, in which order. And how prepared are the two sides? Well, there's a definite aura of smugness emanating from the European Commission. Their man, Michel Barnier, is the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. While the UK seemed to tear itself apart with recriminations hurled between Leavers and Remainers after the EU referendum, with politics and press coverage then becoming caught up in general election fever, the EU was quietly getting its Brexit ducks in a row. It struck me once again this week just how far apart the two sides' pre-negotiating styles are. Theresa May's government insists it has a Brexit plan - but prefers not to divulge it. Instead, British voters are doused in rhetoric: Brexit means Brexit, No deal is better than a bad deal, and so forth, repeated by Prime Minister May in a televised interview just this Monday. Both large parties in the UK election are set for Brexit, no matter what The very same day, the European Commission produced groaningly meaty documents withdraft negotiating details,externalon two of its key Brexit priorities: the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU, and the financial settlement the EU insists Britain pays before leaving. The documents contain no real surprises, but as one of my colleagues noted, ""no detail seems too small"". A stark reminder that the EU has been mulling all this over for the past 11 months. It's been busy game-planning. It's got in the lawyers. How Merkel is 'taking back control' - German style Brexit: All you need to know EU and UK: Galaxies apart over Brexit? EU's Barnier urges vigilance on Brexit In the draft papers, the EU even calls for the salaries of native English teachers at elite European schools attended by civil servants' children to be included in Britain's exit bill. Also listed are the multiple legal acts from which the EU is calculating the UK's financial liabilities, though the final sum is notably absent. The EU wants Britain to agree on a methodology, to work out the precise exit bill in the first stage of negotiations. Brexiteers desperate to ""take back control"" will be angry to see that Brussels wants the European Court of Justice to maintain jurisdiction in disputes involving the rights of EU citizens remaining in the UK after Brexit. Michel Barnier is leading the EU side - and he's been preparing It's this sort of detail that could well lead to confrontation with the UK government from the start - so why publish the minutiae in the first place? Two answers to that one: The European Commission's Michel Barnier is negotiating not on behalf of a single government but 27 of them (the remaining EU member states) plus the European Parliament. So he has to agree a detailed common position at the start. The draft negotiating papers have been made public because Brussels is trying to turn a potential weakness into a strength. With so many players involved on the EU side, the likelihood of press leaks are manifold, so Brussels is going for full disclosure in the name of ""transparency"". Importantly for the UK, absent from any EU document is a mandate for Mr Barnier to negotiate post-Brexit relations with Britain, including a future trade deal, during the first phase of talks. So insist though the British may, it is not in his discretion to start parallel negotiations. This will be tough for Britain's new government to accept. The time pressure is huge. Under EU rules, the Brexit deal must be agreed by March 2019 at the latest, and that's just the divorce, never mind the complexities of sorting out a new UK-EU relationship. Also of note - no matter what some high-profile British politicians like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson might insist - there is in fact no wiggle room in any EU paper published to date to allow UK cherry-picking from the single market, along the lines of 'we want to be part of the single market for cars and financial services, but we don't want to accept freedom of movement'. Alongside the smug ambience at EU HQ as regards Brexit there is also a growing sense of coldness. ""We've gone through the five stages of mourning in rapid succession,"" is something you're often told here. ""From huge sadness at the UK departing, to anger, remorse and now matter-of-fact acceptance."" Unlike normal trade deals between the EU and third countries, Brexit from the EU perspective is about destruction, not creating something new and filled with potential. Whatever emerges from Brexit will be worse, it's felt, than what existed before - and many in the EU want Brexit to be difficult. This video can not be played ""We Europeans have to take our destiny in our own hands,"" says Mrs Merkel Brussels is more than aware that Euroscepticsm is alive and well across the continent. If liberal governments like President Emmanuel Macron's in France disappoint voters, for example, populist nationalists could yet win the day. Mainstream EU leaders are anxious to demonstrate that exiting the club doesn't pay. Brexit has to hurt, they think, to damage the arguments of those in other countries pushing to leave the bloc, From now until March 2019, the UK exists in an uncomfortable twilight zone - legally still an EU member, emotionally already viewed as an outsider. The pre-negotiations rhetoric these 12 months has been bullish and threatening on both sides. That led to a plea from a former judge at the European Court of Justice: for the EU and Britain's new government after 8 June to keep in mind that this is a divorce, not a war.

What happened to Robert the smoking robot?,"More than 80 years ago, a robot could be found in the unlikely surroundings of Kettering, directing traffic and smoking a cigarette. Today, the story of Robert the Robot is little known, even in the Northamptonshire town where he was once a celebrity. Yet in the 1930s, his fame reached as far as Czechoslovakia and the United States, where he even featured in Time magazine. And the reason he came to be? ""Someone bet me Â£5 I could not make a robot in three weeks,"" inventor Charles Lawson, who had a radio shop, told a newspaper at the time. ""I won."" Robert could be seen outside Mr Lawson's shop in Wellington Street, Kettering The electrical engineer's creation first hit headlines in the Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph, which proclaimed: ""Kettering robot 'enjoys' smoke."" The article from March 1939 proclaimed the android could do ""practically everything that a human being can do"", even crediting him with the ""ability of mind reading"". ""You may pick up a card from a pack and the robot will tell you the card you have chosen,"" it read. ""It has a sense of humour too, for when Mr Lawson was bending down to examine its leg he received a slap on the face."" So how did he function? Frustratingly, it is not entirely clear. Robert was popular with children and could also - apparently - direct traffic The only remaining evidence for his existence are a selection of photographs and Robert himself disappeared from view after World War Two. Mr Lawson's son David, an 84-year-old retired farmer, remembers ""wires and gears, a maze of chains and electronics"" inside the robot's 10ft-tall frame. He said his father had built a prototype in 1938, which he had installed in Kettering's Temperance Hall. The robot had a microphone and speaker in its head and hidden assistants would surprise the unsuspecting people walking past. ""They (the assistants) would be looking down at people passing by and suddenly say something about someone's pink hat,"" he said. His father then moved on to the more advanced Robert, who could move his arms and hands. The Meririam Webster dictionary used a picture of Charles Lawson's robot in an advert ""It used to light its own cigarettes. It even directed the traffic in Kettering,"" David Lawson said. ""It even used to tell fortunes and he took it to the seaside, including trips to Blackpool. [My father] got obsessed with it."" Robert was one of the first robots seen in the UK. The very termrobotwas less than 20 years old, having been coined by Czech writerKarel Capek in his 1920 play RUR,external. The first British robot is believed to have been constructed in 1928 and was called Eric. He was subsequently rebuilt and is on display at the Science Museum in London. Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics at Sheffield University and head judge on BBC Two's Robot Wars, said it was most likely Robert was a similar construction to Elektro, a robot made by US power company Westinghouse in 1937 for the New York World's Fair in 1939. Robert first hit the headlines in the Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph ""As is claimed for the Charles Lawson robot, it could walk, talk, smoke and count,"" he said. ""The robot relied on a combination of motors, photoelectric cells, telephone relays and a record player to perform 26 pre-programmed routines, each one initiated by voice commands from a human co-star. ""Smoking was done using automated bellows which were also a feature of 19th Century automatons. ""Remember that this type of robot did not have access to a computer and so talking was done using a triggering mechanism for a record player playing old 78 RPM bakelite records."" Science fiction was in vogue in the 1930s - serials such as Flash Gordon were popular in the cinemas - and Robert became a huge media sensation, drawing the attention of English newspapers. His story was then syndicated abroad where it was eagerly reported by the foreign press. The entry in one Czech newspaper, under the headlineRobot Friend of the Children, read: ""In the English town of Kettering a robot often appears in the streets, it strides, sits down, smoke and speaks. The robot was shown in displays at theatres in Kettering and received coverage in Czech newspapers ""The steel servant is an invention of C. Lawson, once an electric tramway employee. The robot has a sound apparatus in its head. ""Every move of the robot is followed, chiefly by the crowd of young folk, especially when he is on point duty."" Mr Lawson tried to capitalise on Robert's fame, exhibiting him around the country. His son said he eventually sold him to a pier showman in Blackpool shortly before the start of World War Two. Despite several attempts to trace him, Robert's whereabouts remain unknown. But it seems possible he enjoyed a post-war career as a seaside attraction before disappearing into obscurity. Tony Sharkey, head of local history at Blackpool library, said robots often appeared in sideshows during the 1950s, including one from South Africa called Magna. ""From images I've seen it appears to have been very different [to Robert]. The show included illusions and the robot would mind read and tell people what they were wearing."" Mr Lawson sold his shop in the 1960s and retired, but although he was ""quiet man"" he would talk to people about his robots if asked. He died in 2002 in Kettering, aged 96. ""It is only recently when I've thought about the complexity of the robot that I realised how clever he was,"" his son said. Mr Lawson often staged events in Kettering to publicise his robot and his radio shop UK government funding boost for robotics How robots are changing workplaces.

Are 'McJobs' really history?,"Deliveroo classes its riders as self-employed ""independent contractors"" It was the Washington Post that first coined the term in 1986. ""The fast-food factories: McJobs are bad for kids"" a headline announced over a report about thousands of teenagers employed in McDonald's US kitchens. The term took hold, to such an extent the Oxford English Dictionary still defines McJobs - 30 years later - as a catch-all for ""unstimulating, low-paid jobs with few prospects, especially ones created by the expansion of the service sector"". Job insecurity is a common feature. Fretting about ""McJobs"" has returned as the world of work changes rapidly. And whoever wins the next general election will need to deal with this most fundamental of changes, away from the world of the nine-to-five, permanent job with a single employer, and towards a world of flexibility where people and technology become more entwined. The very wealth of our economy depends on riding this wave - a global trend - successfully. One of the first challenges the new prime minister will face is how to react to the most significant inquiry into the new world of work at present being finalised by Matthew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts. He was commissioned to undertake the review by Theresa May last autumn, and has said he will deliver the report to Number 10 shortly after 8 June. Much of this new world of work is said to be negative. The number of zero-hours contracts - which offer no guaranteed work - has grown from 143,000 in 2008 to over 900,000 now. The term McJobs was first used in the 1980s to describe teenagers employed in McDonald's US kitchens Alongside that development comes the expansion of ""self-employment"" which has accounted for 45% of all employment growth over the same period (although it is worth remembering that more than 80% of working adults are still in more traditional, permanent employment). Are zero hours contracts simply the return of ""casualisation"", where employees are at the beck and call of profit-hungry and often unscrupulous employers? Or a nod to new, modern needs for flexibility, so that work can be balanced with the rest of life? Is hiring from the new army of the ""self-employed"" simply a way of businesses avoiding tax and pension responsibilities and bypassing the rights - such as holiday and maternity leave - guaranteed to full time workers? Or a nod to individual autonomy, where people work to their own rhythm and receive just reward for their entrepreneurial flair? Of course, it depends which businesses you speak to. Especially if it's the business that was the original butt of the McJobs attack - McDonald's. ""We have restaurant managers that look after 100 people, they are running businesses over Â£2m [in revenues] and they are responsible at a young age for their fortunes and their future,"" Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald's UK, told me. Many of those managers started in the kitchens - not actually flipping burgers, it turns out, as machines fry the beef patties on both sides and there is no need to turn them over. Indeed, when I put it to one manager, Liz Stephenson, that working in McDonald's is not all ""flipping burgers"", she replies archly: ""I've never flipped a burger."" Some fear that automation could increasingly replace workers in the future Snobbery is one word that comes to the mind of people like Liz when they consider how some view a career like hers, which started behind the counter on casual hours when she was at school and now involves being the company point person for restaurant managers who are running businesses with revenues counted in the tens of millions of pounds a year. We have long had a rather romanticised vision of manufacturing jobs - even low-skilled ones - and have yet to fall in love with the service economy - such as retail - despite the fact it makes up the vast proportion of our economy. ""McDonald's offer training and a real career,"" Ms Stephenson (who is off to Chicago to receive a global company award for her achievements) tells me. ""I've heard all the jokes."" Whatever the protestations of businesses which say they have worked hard improving their employment practices (McDonald's offers zero-hours workers rights to sick and holiday pay and has never demanded employees abide by ""exclusivity clauses""), chief executives know controversies over companies such as Sports Direct and Uber can muddy all their reputations. ""Businesses take decisions that do damage,"" Mr Pomroy said, making clear he is not referring to any specific examples. ""Businesses in the modern world need to open up more, be transparent and be honest about how they treat their people and how they treat their customers. ""The internet has such a vast array of information, you can't sit back and hide anymore and not be front foot."" He added: ""People up and down our workforce want to be treated with respect, they want a fair chance, they want progression, they want to have fun when they are working, they want to feel part of a team. McDonald's says it will hire more people in the UK ""I want to be able to walk into our staff rooms and look people in the eye and know we are treating them fairly - whether it is the 16-year-old school leaver or the 35-year-old mum who is using our flexible contacts to interweave with childcare."" Mr Pomroy dismisses claims that zero-hours contracts, for example, are simply a method for firms to keep people in insecure, low-paid work. As Iwrote last month, when offered the chance to move on to fixed-hours contracts, 80% of McDonald's staff affected said they preferred zero-hours. The other big, robotic, beast in the room when it comes to the new world of work is technology. The fear is that while we worry about zero-hours and self-employment, artificial intelligence and computers that can crunch ""big data"" in the blink of an eye are going to replace millions of us in the workplace. For services industries like his, Mr Pomroy is not so sure. ""Since we have introduced technology - you can place your order on giant screens - it hasn't actually saved us labour in terms of reducing the number of people we need,"" he said. ""We've actually used that as a springboard to put more people out in the dining area, so giving hospitality. ""We've introduced table service. Using technology to enhance the customer experience is what is critical - not cutting the number of jobs we offer. ""So since we have been introducing technology, we've recruited a further 5,000 people - taking our total workforce to 115,000."" That jobs growth will continue, he insists, revealing plans to recruit 2,000 to 3,000 jobs a year. ""We have over half our restaurants open 24 hours a day, five days a week, and there is still opportunity to extend the number of restaurants that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ""We are also a growing business. We have had 11 years of consecutive sales growth. I've got no plans to slow that down.""

Did the Nazis locate a secret U-boat base in Spain?,"The building known as Casa Winter was built at the top of a hill Looking up from the wild and barely accessible beach of Cofete, on Fuerteventura's rugged southern tip, it is hard not to wonder who would have built a house high up on the hillside. According to some, the remote location of the building known as Casa Winter is not explained by its fine views over a landscape that now forms part of Jandia natural park, but something far more sinister: the presence of Nazis in the Canary Islands during World War Two. ""There is so much to investigate here, but no-one is helping me,"" says an exasperated Pedro Fumero, the current occupant of Casa Winter who believes he may be sleeping on top of a secret base or hideaway designed for use by the Nazis. The 48-year-old former taxi driver, whose grandfather helped to build the house and later lived in it, moved into the building in 2012, having found out that his two uncles and an aunt were inhabiting the place in poor health and squalid conditions. The family is facing an eviction order after a hotel company bought the property from the descendants of Gustav Winter, a German engineer whose unusual wartime activities on Fuerteventura attracted the attention of Allied spies. Winter, who was born in the Black Forest region in 1893 and moved to the Canary Islands in 1925, was one of 104 German residents in Spain whom Allies requested be repatriated to Germany at the end of WW2 to face accusations of being Nazi agents. A 1947 document on these Nazi suspects from the Madrid bureau chief of the US Office of Strategic Services, a precursor of the CIA, describes Winter as a radio operator and military operator. Like other Germans on the list of suspected Nazis whom the Allies had wanted to question and put on trial after the war, Winter was not handed over by the Spanish authorities. He died in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1971. ""I am sure Gustav Winter was provisioning German submarines,"" states Mr Fumero, citing wartime reports and some of his own findings, such as a battery he says is from a U-boat and that he found in the property. ""Why would you build a tower like this on top of what is essentially a bunker? This was never a house meant for enjoyment,"" says Mr Fumero, standing inside the turret-like construction that dominates the upper level of Casa Winter, equipped with an unusually large fuse box. U-47, pictured in 1939 Could the tower have been used for communications? Or even as a kind of lighthouse, sending messages through electric flashes? Local historians mostly conclude that Cofete's beach would have been unsuitable for naval use due to its shallow approach, but also point out that the natural harbour of Ajuy, 20 miles (32km) along Fuerteventura's remote east coast, could have been used by submarines or other large craft. The biggest spaces inside the building are in the solid basement, whose walls are almost 2m (6ft 7in) thick. Several rooms have no windows, including one tunnel-like space which runs the length of the house with just a small window at one end. Mr Fumero speculates that such spaces could have been used for concealing people - with or without their consent - but admits that he cannot be sure who or when. Mr Fumero believes the place known as Casa Winter could have been used by the Nazis Local documents date the house as being built in 1946, but Mr Fumero claims the ""bunker"" or base of the building was there much earlier, pointing to papers he believes show that Winter had bought out the previous Spanish landowner and acquired the entire Jandia peninsula shortly after General Franco had become Spain's dictatorial ruler in 1939. Under Franco, Spain declared itself to be strictly neutral at the outbreak of WW2, but supplied minerals, volunteer soldiers and, in places such as the Canary Islands, logistical support to Nazi forces. The ""U-boat peril"", as Winston Churchill described German submarine power, was a huge threat to Britain's survival during the early stages of World War Two. U-boats, supplemented by mines, aircraft and surface ships, succeeded in sinking three million tons of Allied shipping between the fall of France in June 1940 and the end of that year. At the outbreak of WW2 in 1939, Spain was a broken country after the conclusion of its three-year civil war. General Francisco Franco wished to avoid dragging Spain into WW2, but his regime owed a large debt of gratitude, in material and other terms, to fascist Germany and Italy. Spain was officially neutral, but unofficially on the Axis powers' side. And Spanish ports became important refuelling and provisioning sites for roving U-boats between 1940 and 1942. More about World War Two from BBC History Alberto Vazquez-Figueroa, a writer from the Canary Islands in whose novel Fuerteventura Casa Winter is fictionalised as a kind of Nazi pleasure palace, says that islanders were kept out of the southern peninsula until the 1950s, when the Franco regime finally removed a fence which crossed the spit of land from coast to coast. ""Word was that Franco had ceded that part of the island to the Germans and they had built a small airstrip there."" Winter built an airstrip in the barren, rock-strewn stretch of land between Cofete beach and his curious mansion, the remains of which are still evident to walkers and whose parallel lines of stones are visible in Google satellite pictures of the coast. ""I was told by one of his sons that it was because Winter's wife had a difficult birth experience, so he decided that planes should get access,"" says Juan Jose Diaz Benitez, a history lecturer at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, who has researched the story. Dr Diaz Benitez believes that Winter used connections with the Nazi authorities in the 1930s to secure investment for the building of the harbour at Morro Jable and a plan to electrify the island of Fuerteventura and build a cement factory. Diaz Benitez cites a wartime letter from a German official to Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering ""complaining that it was rumoured in the Canaries that one Gustavo Winter was supplying fuel to German submarines, and that this was attracting the attention of enemy spies"". ""The only thing proven by German documents is the subsidies he got for economic plans for island of Fuerteventura,"" Dr Diaz Benitez argues. Cofete is a wild and barely accessible beach in southern Fuerteventura The presence of German submarines in the Canaries archipelago during the conflict is an established historical fact. Dr Diaz Benitez says that besides the frequent use of local ports by tanker ships that would rendezvous with U-boats at distant, secret locations, German submarines docked at Las Palmas six times between May and July of 1941, prompting an official complaint by an exasperated British consul on the island of Gran Canaria. The alleged submarine battery and part of the bunker at Casa Winter For now, Mr Fumero's worries relate to the future of the house. But Lopesan, the company that now owns Casa Winter, told the BBC that it did not intend to develop the site as a resort, but rather ""turn it into an interpretation centre"". ""There are signs that this may have been a historically important and strategic site. We won't be developing the area around the house, but only restoring the building,"" Lopesan said. Mr Fumero believes there is more to come from below the surface, literally. He says that he has asked a ground-penetrating radar company to prospect below Casa Winter, which he believes stands on a natural cave, a volcanic fissure which could be connected via a tunnel to the sea. ""It's not comfortable living out here. I left my family on Tenerife; I had a partner, but she couldn't take this remoteness. But now I am on a mission to uncover the truth about the house,"" he says.

Cruz control: BA's unanswered questions,"I admit I'm no IT expert, but over the past few days I've spoken to plenty of people who are. These are people who have either engineered airline IT networks or actually worked on British Airways' systems in the past. What I've heard is a lot of confusion and scepticism at the idea that a local power surge could have wreaked such havoc. There is also confusion as to why back-up systems didn't do their job. Only the people in the room know exactly what happened, so these views are based on the information made public, and bucketfuls of IT experience, including at BA. One put it like this: ""BA has two data centres near Heathrow, about a kilometre apart, so how could a power surge affect both?"" Then there are all the fail-safes in place. The two data centres mirror each other I'm told, so when one collapses the other should take over. BA board to demand IT chaos inquiry Can Cruz keep control of BA? BA boss 'won't resign' over flight chaos All the big installations have back-up power. If the mains fails, a  UPS (uninterruptable power supply) kicks in. It's basically a big battery that keeps things ticking over until the power comes back on, or a diesel generator is fired up. This UPS is meant to take the hit from any ""surge"", so the servers don't have to. All the big servers and large routers, I'm told, also have dual power supplies fed from different sources. This video can not be played The BBC's Richard Westcott quizzed boss Alex Cruz over the outsourcing of technical staff to India I'm also told that, certainly a while ago, they used to have regular outages to confirm all the back-up bits were working. And daily inspections of the computer room. There is no reason to think these were stopped. It's not even clear who was monitoring the system at the crucial time. Was it a contractor? How much experience did they have? The point is this: certainly up until a while ago, British Airways' IT systems had a variety of safety nets in place to protect them from big dumps of uncontrolled power, and to get things back on their feet quickly if there was any problem. I'm assuming those safety nets are still there, so why did they fail? And did human error play a part in all this? British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz told me recently that the company has launched an exhaustive investigation into what went wrong, although no-one can say when it will report back, and whether the findings will ever be made public. If BA wants to repair its reputation, its owner IAG needs to convince the public that making hundreds of IT staff redundant last year did not leave them woefully short of experts who could have fixed the meltdown sooner. And that it won't happen again - at least not on this epic scale. Mr Cruz was adamant, by the way, that the outsourcing did not contribute in any way to this mess.

Juliet becomes Julius in Shakespeare's love story,"George Caple (top) and Elliott Kingsley play Romeo and Julius at the Liverpool Everyman There has been much speculation about William Shakespeare's sexuality - so is there a chance that, if it had been acceptable in his time, he might have written his greatest love story about Romeo and Julius instead of Romeo and Juliet? ""I think he probably would if I'm honest,"" says Nick Bagnall, who's directing a new version of Romeo and Juliet, as the Bard (maybe might possibly have) intended it - with two men in the lead roles. We know Shakespeare intended Juliet to be played by a young man - all female roles were played by boys and men at that time. But this version, staged by the Liverpool Everyman, is the first time a major British theatre has made it about gay lovers. One theory -put forward by Oscar Wilde,external, among others - says Shakespeare wrote Juliet and other girls' roles for a young actor who was the object of his affections. ""There's a huge debate around what he thought about the actor playing Juliet,"" says Bagnall. ""I'm pretty good on the archives and research, and I think he probably would have quite liked to have done that [written Juliet as a male] if he'd been allowed, I really do."" The pronouns have been changed, but the rest of the star-cross'd lovers' story stays the same The Liverpool production keeps the play's original title, but in the play itself Juliet is now Julius - played by 20-year-old Elliott Kingsley. ""I think he'd totally love it,"" Kingsley says, continuing the speculation about Shakespeare's true feelings. ""Shakespeare wrote this part for a man. A boy played Juliet originally, and it's widely believed that it was a boy that he was in love with, and that this was his love letter to this actor. ""So it's not beyond the realms of possibility for a man to say these words with truth because originally that's the way it was."" 'I'd unearthed something exciting' The speculation about Shakespeare's sexuality stems from his sonnets, which are dedicated to ""Mr WH"" and many of which are addressed to a mysterious young man known as the ""Fair Youth"". But there's scant evidence about who this figure was, or where the Bard's affections lay. The idea to turn Romeo and Juliet into a gay love story came when an actor delivered one of Juliet's yearning monologues during an audition. Bagnall says: ""Watching a male speaking that rather feminine language about the frustration of needing Romeo to come to him that night, I just thought, I wonder [what it would be like] if I read the whole play again with that in mind. ""And with a few trims and changing 'she' to 'he' and 'mistress' to 'master', I felt like I'd unearthed something really exciting in that play."" The show is part of the Liverpool Everyman's first rep season for 25 years In the original Romeo and Juliet, the hero is initially in love with Rosaline before falling for Juliet. In the Liverpool version, Bagnall says Romeo is confused about his sexuality. ""I think when he sees Julius it unlocks an inner turmoil in him and it makes that journey really muscular, and the inner turmoil he lives with is really interesting."" That manliness lends the story unexpected new meanings, says the director. He is speaking just after the cast have rehearsed the final death scene. ""It was a really violent scene, which I've never really seen before,"" he says. In the past, he's found that ending ""quite flowery"" and has been ""disappointed"". ""But watching it this morning with muscularity and a 6ft 2in lump of a lad in tears - there are certainly [new] things that are pinging out more and more."" And there's another meaning pinging out now. In this version, Romeo is white and Julius and the Capulet family are not. That raises questions about attitudes towards homosexuality in some countries and communities. ""It makes it incredibly exciting and devastating when we open up a discussion about young gay men in certain countries around the world where, still happening to this day, they're banished, tortured, abused, sent from their families, disowned for being a gay man. ""Within the company of people I'm working with, that's been quite a big decision that we've embraced - the race, and how you can justify anything, which the Capulets do anyway, with the phrase 'in God's name.'"" Liverpool Everyman revives rep company Theatre's star-studded class of '74 Romeo and Juliet opens on Wednesday, but the 14-strong company has been together for three and a half months - performing in the Liverpool Everyman's first rep season for 25 years. They are following in the footsteps of the likes of Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite and Jonathan Pryce, who emerged from the illustrious Everyman rep companies of the early 1970s. This year's company started with a five-star Fiddler on the Roof, followed by the surreal Conquest of the South Pole, children's show The Story Giant, austerity musical The Sum, and ending with Romeo and Juliet. ""If Romeo and Juliet had been the first show in the season I don't think I would be able to do some of the things I've been doing, in terms of just letting your guard down,"" says George Caple, who plays Romeo. ""I genuinely believe the work is better when people properly trust each other in the room, which we all do."" Left-right: Emily Hughes, Dean Nolan, Laura Dos Santos Emily Hughes- has shone on her professional debut with a magnetic combination of brittleness and goofiness Dean Nolan- a huge presence who steals every scene, whether he's doing slapstick or soul searching.

General Noriega's pen pal: An American school girl,"Panama's General Manuel Noriega with troops in 1985 Andrea was around 14 years old, flipping through her school friend's photo album when something strange caught her eye. She was at a US boarding school in the early 1990s and, in the days before mobile phones, everyone kept their hard copy keepsakes with them. ""There were all these pictures of her family in rural Michigan,"" she recalled. ""Baby photos of her and her siblingsâ¦"" But then among all the standard-issue images, something a little different caught her eye. There was her friend, Sarah, sitting with someone else's family: the family of General Manuel Noriega, the former Panamanian leaderwho died on Tuesday. Andrea recognised him instantly. In the 1980s, Noriega was public enemy number one in the US, as the country battled for continuing control of the Panama Canal. Coming across this photo back then was the equivalent of finding decades-old photos of a school pal cosying up with Osama Bin Laden. ""Pineapple face,"" said Andrea Morningstar (nÃ©e Maio). That was the nickname detractors had given him, and which became known even to school children. Andrea's friend was Sarah York, a girl whose childhood had taken an unusual turn around four years earlier, when she wrote a letter, on a whim, to a man she saw on the TV news. While her parents were watching a special edition of the current affairs show 60 Minutes discussing Noriega's drug-trafficking links, 10-year-old Sarah happened to observe that he had a nice hat. Her dad collected hats. Perhaps if she wrote to this man on the TV, he would send them a hat. Ask him, said her dad. So she did. She sent short letter on notepaper with a picture of a partridge on it. Obituary: General Manuel Noriega Music torture: How heavy metal broke Noriega Panama's Noriega: From power to prison To the family's surprise, a few weeks later, an envelope arrived in their mailbox, with a Panamanian flag stamped on the front. It was not hat-shaped, but it was from General Noriega. It was officially headed and signed. And, not only that, he also asked her to keep up the correspondence. He wrote: ""Dear Sarah, I feel honored by your letter. I appreciate your message of faith and friendship. I hope you continue sending your message and tell me about yourself and your city. With friendship and appreciation, General Manuel Antonio Noriega."" They did so for a number of months. He sent books about Central America; she told him about her school grades. He even sent the much-wanted hat. Then, in the weirdest twist of all, he sent an invitation for her and her family to visit Panama City, all expenses paid. Studies at a military academy in Peru. Begins a three-decade relationship with the CIA Backs a coup that topples President Arnulfo Arias in 1968 Rises in influence after mysterious plane crash death of Gen Omar Torrijos, becoming de facto ruler in 1983 Ousted in 1989 after US invasion, and jailed in US Back in a Panamanian prison in 2014, unsuccessfully sues company behind Call of Duty video game for using his image without permission The visit went ahead in 1988, making the international press - from The New York Times to the Guardian - while attracting plenty of criticism. People accused the family of lacking patriotism, and supporting a brutal regime. Even Sarah's brother - an avid reader of the news - was angry, at least at first. Meanwhile, Noriega was accused of exploiting a child and using her in political games. After her 15 minutes of fame faded, Sarah chalked the visit up as a weird life experience and, showing signs of musical talent, pursued an education in the arts, where she met Andrea during a year at boarding school. She was not keen to share the story when Andrea happened upon the photos. ""I had to ask and she reluctantly told me,"" said Andrea. ""I thought it was remarkable, and hilarious."" Sarah York (L) and Andrea Claire Morningstar pictured together last year; they remain good friends Ten years later, Andrea had finished film school and was keen to get involved with a radio show called This American Life, which is famed for its storytelling and is popular globally in podcast form. ""I had a friend from college who was a producer there, and he would send me their production themes lists,"" she said. When she saw an upcoming show called Love Your Enemies, she knew she had the perfect tale. Sarah agreed to take part only if her friend was the interviewer. So the producers agreed to take a punt on Andrea, then a 20-something with no radio experience. TheMy Pen Pal episode,external, which aired in 2003, made compelling listening.  It tackled the good guy/bad guy narrative of the press and politics; it explored childhood innocence and curiosity; it looked at propaganda and multiple realities. Radio host Ira Glass presented the My Pen Pal episode of This American Life ""I knew that I was going to get plenty of the bad guy story, so why not get the story from the bad guy, you know?"" said Sarah, during the interview.  ""But I don't know that I ever said: 'I'm going to be the judge of this'. I think it was more just, let's see what happens. Or let's see what we can find out."" The radio show recalled the friendship bracelet she made for Noriega in camouflage colours. Her memories of touching down in the Panamanian capital: ""Flashbulbs were going off everywhere, and everyone was, like, saying my name."" The show's host, Ira Glass, told the BBC he still remembers that show and it remains one of his favourite episodes. ""When I heard that Manuel Noriega died, the first thing I thought of was this episode from 2003, that revealed a side of him that was personal and surprising. His motives in starting a correspondence with a 10-year-old American were obviously self-serving. But the way the whole thing plays out show a private side of the man that was fascinating for me and I'm guessing for anyone who saw him in the news back in the 1980s."" Now living in Minnesota, Sarah still performs as a musician and has two children, as well as a lifelong interest in Panama. But she would still rather not talk about her former pen pal publicly. A yearbook photo with Sarah (third left) and Andrea (far right) ""I think it is complicated,"" said Andrea, now anartist and filmmaker,external. ""The perceived reality is so different from her experiences. It's taxing, to be defined by it, although she doesn't mind people knowing."" Andrea said her friend has always been a intriguing character, motivated by curiosity. At university she taught herself to swim after checking out some swimming books from the library. After graduating, she moved to northern Wisconsin and went off-grid for a few years, teaching herself about indigenous herbal remedies. As for Noriega, he wasoverthrown in a 1989 US invasion, and later jailed in the US on drugs and money laundering charges. He spent the rest of his life in custody, latterly in Panama for murder, corruption and embezzlement. He died earlier this week, two months after brain surgery.

Five key things from the BBC debate,"This video can not be played Watch highlights from the BBC debate Senior politicians from seven parties - although not the prime minister - took part in the BBC election debate on Wednesday. Home Secretary Amber Rudd went head-to-head with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, UKIP's Paul Nuttall, SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson, Green co-leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. Defending her absence, Mrs May said she preferred ""taking questions and meeting people"" on the campaign trail rather than ""squabbling"" with other politicians. Here are five key themes from the showdown. ""WhereisTheresa"" was trending before the debate began, and the party leaders didn't let the PM's absence be forgotten. Leanne Wood went on the attack first, saying Mrs May was not there because ""her campaign of soundbites is falling apart"". Mr Farron was hot on her heels, quipping: ""Where do you think Theresa May is tonight? Take a look out your window. She might be out there sizing up your house to pay for your social care."" For the SNP deputy leader, the PM's no-show was evidence she lacked ""guts"". Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn asked ""where is Theresa May, what happened to her?"" as he defended his own leadership abilities. Ms Lucas said the ""first rule of leadership is to show up"". However, it was the Lib Dem leader who persistently went after Mrs May, telling voters they should ""make a brew"" and watch Bake Off instead because the PM ""couldn't be bothered"" to turn up. Twitter users also embraced the themewith memes searching for the PM. This video can not be played Which party will help those in need? Ms Rudd repeatedly accused Mr Corbyn of having a ""magic money tree"" - most notably after he attacked a Tory U-turn on disability benefits and accused the party of planning more cuts. ""Jeremy, I know there is no extra payment you don't want to add to, no tax you don't want to rise... we have to stop thinking - as you do - that there is a magic money tree,"" she said. Mr Corbyn counter-attacked on poverty, asking Ms Rudd whether she had ever been to a food bank or seen people sleeping around stations. But the ""magic money tree"" kept reappearing. ""May's strong and stable replaced by Rudd's 'magic money tree',"" was the Guardian deputy editor Paul Johnson's verdict. It was inevitable that a question about Brexit would turn into a debate about immigration. Tim Farron cited a doctor receiving racial abuse as a consequence of what happens when you ""demonise"" migrants. The UKIP leader - who Ms Lucas accused of ""hate-filled rhetoric"" on immigration - denied claims he was demonising immigrants, but insisted: ""We have to get the population under control."" Ms Rudd said it was important to have an immigration policy the UK can control, while Mr Corbyn said he wanted it to be ""fair"". Arguably the most powerful moment came when Mr Robertson said the debate about immigration ""shames and demeans us all"". It's been a while since the Tory party had to talk about a coalition, but Ms Rudd kept mentioning the ""coalition of chaos"". She said a vote for anyone other than Theresa May would be a ""vote for Jeremy Corbyn and that coalition"" - and all the ""squabbling"" made her realise how chaotic a coalition would be. Ms Wood wasn't too happy about the suggestion, hitting back that it was the Conservative Party and UKIP that were in coalition. The debate was difficult to follow at times, with politicians interrupting and shouting over each other.  ""Let him speak"" and ""can I finish?"" were common mantras. Tim Farron's one-liners, which weren't reserved for Mrs May's no-show, went down a storm on social media. Buzzfeed's Jim Waterson joked that the Lib Dem leader added 500,000 viewers to the viewing figures for Bake Off. But it was the Plaid Cymru leader's personal attack on UKIP leader Paul Nuttall that arguably attracted the most attention. Criticising the party's approach to Brexit, she suggested the UKIP leader was someone who would try to divorce his wife without paying, adding: ""We all know about blokes like you.""

University challenge," If you’re looking to study Veterinary Science at Cambridge, you might want to brush up on Wallace & Gromit’s mission to eat the moon on crackers. According to Do You Think You’re Clever? – a book by John Farndon aimed at answering the lateral Oxbridge entry questions – potential students have genuinely been asked, ""Is the moon made of green cheese?"" Although the rumours about instantly being dismissed for wearing The Wrong Trousers, like Wallace's mechanical trousers from the story of the same name, remain unconfirmed. When applying for a post at Stanford University in California, you probably wouldn't expect a question about who would win in a fight between Spiderman and Batman (unless you’re actually Batman, in which case you’re prepared for everything). But this was an actual question posed to candidates during interviews for a position as a medical simulationist. It was designed to see how candidates would test such a putative conflict scientifically, and not simply by smashing two action figures together like they did when they were five. Less tangential than most of the obscure questions on the list, this question was posed to kick off some History interviews at Oxford University. Although it wouldn’t give you the complete picture, the idea is that you could probably learn a significant amount about the world today through sport. The key is ""everything to do with sport"", as it would include all the financial aspects – giving you an insight into how the economics works; and tell-all autobiographies, which would show there was a healthy market for ghost writers. This was the challenge given to potential Music students at Cambridge when they were asked to conceive of a new musical instrument. Interviewees said this question made them treble and some needed to take a minuet to compose themselves. One student confessed, ""My answer fell flat but I've been feeling off-key all day."" Not just the fruit equivalent of “to be or not to be”... Medical students at Cambridge had to be able to discern the advantages and disadvantages of different types of fruit. You might think it’s all Much Ado About Nothing and know many Merry Wives of Windsor who live in a Hamlet, who insist that when they get their grapefruit from the Merchant of Venice, they come As You Like It. Shakespeare puns will not get you into a medical school, but you might get in for English. Just so you know: All’s Well That Ends Well. Radio Dramas which delight and surprise. Exploring the UCAS personal statement: how can you sum yourself up in 4,000 characters? A-levels, inter-railing and affairs in Jack Rosenthal's comedy drama set in the 1990s. Amy Rosenthal's affectionate tribute to her dad reveals an unusual pact they made in 1993."
Juliet becomes Julius in Shakespeare's same-sex love story,"George Caple (top) and Elliott Kingsley play Romeo and Julius at the Liverpool Everyman There has been much speculation about William Shakespeare's sexuality - so is there a chance that, if it had been acceptable in his time, he might have written his greatest love story about Romeo and Julius instead of Romeo and Juliet? ""I think he probably would if I'm honest,"" says Nick Bagnall, who's directing a new version of Romeo and Juliet, as the Bard (maybe might possibly have) intended it - with two men in the lead roles. We know Shakespeare intended Juliet to be played by a young man - all female roles were played by boys and men at that time. But this version, staged by the Liverpool Everyman, is the first time a major British theatre has made it about gay lovers. One theory -put forward by Oscar Wilde,external, among others - says Shakespeare wrote Juliet and other girls' roles for a young actor who was the object of his affections. ""There's a huge debate around what he thought about the actor playing Juliet,"" says Bagnall. ""I'm pretty good on the archives and research, and I think he probably would have quite liked to have done that [written Juliet as a male] if he'd been allowed, I really do."" The pronouns have been changed, but the rest of the star-cross'd lovers' story stays the same The Liverpool production keeps the play's original title, but in the play itself Juliet is now Julius - played by 20-year-old Elliott Kingsley. ""I think he'd totally love it,"" Kingsley says, continuing the speculation about Shakespeare's true feelings. ""Shakespeare wrote this part for a man. A boy played Juliet originally, and it's widely believed that it was a boy that he was in love with, and that this was his love letter to this actor. ""So it's not beyond the realms of possibility for a man to say these words with truth because originally that's the way it was."" 'I'd unearthed something exciting' The speculation about Shakespeare's sexuality stems from his sonnets, which are dedicated to ""Mr WH"" and many of which are addressed to a mysterious young man known as the ""Fair Youth"". But there's scant evidence about who this figure was, or where the Bard's affections lay. The idea to turn Romeo and Juliet into a gay love story came when an actor delivered one of Juliet's yearning monologues during an audition. Bagnall says: ""Watching a male speaking that rather feminine language about the frustration of needing Romeo to come to him that night, I just thought, I wonder [what it would be like] if I read the whole play again with that in mind. ""And with a few trims and changing 'she' to 'he' and 'mistress' to 'master', I felt like I'd unearthed something really exciting in that play."" The show is part of the Liverpool Everyman's first rep season for 25 years In the original Romeo and Juliet, the hero is initially in love with Rosaline before falling for Juliet. In the Liverpool version, Bagnall says Romeo is confused about his sexuality. ""I think when he sees Julius it unlocks an inner turmoil in him and it makes that journey really muscular, and the inner turmoil he lives with is really interesting."" That manliness lends the story unexpected new meanings, says the director. He is speaking just after the cast have rehearsed the final death scene. ""It was a really violent scene, which I've never really seen before,"" he says. In the past, he's found that ending ""quite flowery"" and has been ""disappointed"". ""But watching it this morning with muscularity and a 6ft 2in lump of a lad in tears - there are certainly [new] things that are pinging out more and more."" And there's another meaning pinging out now. In this version, Romeo is white and Julius and the Capulet family are not. That raises questions about attitudes towards homosexuality in some countries and communities. ""It makes it incredibly exciting and devastating when we open up a discussion about young gay men in certain countries around the world where, still happening to this day, they're banished, tortured, abused, sent from their families, disowned for being a gay man. ""Within the company of people I'm working with, that's been quite a big decision that we've embraced - the race, and how you can justify anything, which the Capulets do anyway, with the phrase 'in God's name.'"" Liverpool Everyman revives rep company Theatre's star-studded class of '74 Romeo and Juliet opens on Wednesday, but the 14-strong company has been together for three and a half months - performing in the Liverpool Everyman's first rep season for 25 years. They are following in the footsteps of the likes of Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite and Jonathan Pryce, who emerged from the illustrious Everyman rep companies of the early 1970s. This year's company started with a five-star Fiddler on the Roof, followed by the surreal Conquest of the South Pole, children's show The Story Giant, austerity musical The Sum, and ending with Romeo and Juliet. ""If Romeo and Juliet had been the first show in the season I don't think I would be able to do some of the things I've been doing, in terms of just letting your guard down,"" says George Caple, who plays Romeo. ""I genuinely believe the work is better when people properly trust each other in the room, which we all do."" Left-right: Emily Hughes, Dean Nolan, Laura Dos Santos Emily Hughes- has shone on her professional debut with a magnetic combination of brittleness and goofiness Dean Nolan- a huge presence who steals every scene, whether he's doing slapstick or soul searching. And if they ever make a Brian Blessed biopic... Laura Dos Santos- excelled at playing an everywoman on the verge in the lead role in Lizzie Nunnery's The Sum Romeo and Juliet runs until 7 June, then all five Everyman Rep shows will play in rotation until 1 July.
