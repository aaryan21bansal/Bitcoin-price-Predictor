Outrage in Italy after cable car crash video aired,"Only one person survived the crash on 23 May Italy's public broadcaster Rai has faced strong criticism for airing leaked CCTV footage of a fatal cable car crash that killed 14 people. The cabin is seen nearing its final stop before suddenly rearing up, then speeding back down the mountain and crashing to the ground. The prosecutor in the case spoke of ""the absolute inappropriateness"" of publishing the footage. The head of Rai TV said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the decision to show it. Five families were on board the car when it crashed, including two children who were among the dead. Five-year-old Eitan Biran was the sole survivor when the main cable holding the car snapped on 23 May. He lost his parents and two-year-old brother, originally from Israel, and his great grandparents. Prosecutors say the emergency brake, which could have prevented the accident, had been intentionally disabled. The car reversed at over 100km/h (62mph) on a support cable, passing a support pylon and then plummeting to the ground and rolling down the mountain. The CCTV footage was first obtained and shown on a news programme on Italian channel Rai 3, with the cabin blurred. It has since been republished in full or in part by several other Italian media, with some only obscuring the victims' faces. A second clip shows a worker running for help as the accident unfolds. Prosecutor Olimpia Bossi said in a press release that although the suspects in the case were aware of the videos' existence, relatives had not been informed and the broadcast of the footage was prohibited. The suffering of the victims' families, she said, ""cannot and must not be further exacerbated by actions like this"". The Italian Data Protection Authority has urged media organisations and social media users not to share the clips out of respect to the victims and their relatives, ""so that pain does not become a tool for an extra like"". Video suggests cable car brake disabled for years Italy probes cause of fatal cable car accident Local Mayor Marcella Severino said she too was appalled by the decision to show the video: ""I don't think it was appropriate towards the victims and their families."" The head of the public broadcaster, Marcello Foa, said he had ""always respected the editorial choices of the directors and I have always refrained from commenting on them publicly, but as president of Rai in this case I cannot remain silent"". ""It is a duty for the public service, in circumstances like this, to carefully evaluate all the implications, starting with the ethical ones and respect for the victims and their families,"" he added. This video can not be played Pictures from the scene showed the wreckage of the cable car nestled among trees Politicians joined the condemnation. Former education minister Valeria Fedeli said in a joint statement with fellow Democratic Party politician Andrea Romano that the channel needed to explain its actions. The decision showed ""total disrespect for the victims and their family members"", they argued, adding that the violation of the publication ban was ""all the more serious because it was carried out by public service providers"". Senator Laura Garvini said in a Facebook post that the broadcast of the video ""means trampling on the memory of the victims and the pain of their families. Sensationalising death has nothing to do with the right of the press."" However, La Stampa newspaper defended its decision to republish the footage, arguing that it was ""stronger than 1,000 words and clarifies how the intervention of the brakes could have prevented the disaster"". Three suspects from the company that operated the cable car are currently under investigation over the incident.  A technician has admitted installing a fork-shaped bracket to deactivate the emergency brake, which had reportedly been malfunctioning, earlier this year. However, a cable car expert has alleged that earlier videos he took suggest the emergency brake was already disabled in 2014. Cable car expert Michael Meier says the grey fork brackets (circled top left) were already in place when he visited on 6 January 2014 Video suggests cable car brake disabled for years Italy probes cause of fatal cable car accident Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump sentencing hearing in New York hush-money case begins What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Naomi Osaka will not play at Wimbledon,"Osaka has twice reached the third round at the All England Club Japan's Naomi Osaka will not play at Wimbledon this year but is planning to return in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The four-time Grand Slam champion will spend time with friends and family having also withdrawn from the French Open in May. At the time, Osaka, 23, said she would betaking a break from tennisafter experiencing depression and anxiety. The world number two says she is ""excited to play in front of her home fans"" in Tokyo. Osaka was fined $15,000 (Â£10,570) for not taking part in a news conference following her first round match at Roland Garros. Grand Slam organisers said she could face expulsion from the tournament should she refuse to take part in media duties. But the player withdrew from the tournament the following day, saying she needed to ""protect her mental health"". ""When the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans,"" she added at the time. Wimbledon's chief executive Sally Bolton had earlier revealed the All England Club (AELTC) had been in contact with Osaka's team and was actively looking at ways to improve its media operations. ""We have started a consultation,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""Of course, that consultation needs to include not just the players, but the media and all of those engaged in that space."" Wimbledon tournament director Jamie Baker said on Wednesday that he had told Osaka's entourage that the phone lines were always open to discuss any issues that might arise. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller A Wimbledon appearance by Naomi Osaka has seemed extremely unlikely ever since she withdrew from the French Open. But what is very encouraging is that the 23-year-old feels able to represent her country at her home Olympics in just six weeks' time. The shorter-than-usual two-week gap between the French Open and Wimbledon may not have made any difference to Osaka's decision, but has repercussions for others -most notably Rafael Nadal. The 35-year-old ultimately had to choose between the two Grand Slams. Roger Federer is one who will empathise. The 39-year-old withdrew from Roland Garros after three rounds to protect his knee, but also his chances of being truly competitive at Wimbledon.

Food and drink exports to EU 'almost halve',"UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%. The trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor. The government said it was ""too early to draw any firm conclusions"" on the long term impact of Brexit. It also said the pandemic had depressed demand. ""The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,"" a government spokesperson added. Rachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the ""red tape is strangling"" her business. She said that EU sales ""utterly dropped off a cliff"" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. Rachel Hicks of Sky Wave Gin said EU sales had ""dropped off a cliff"" ""The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,"" Ms Hicks said. ""We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad."" Graham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had ""come down drastically"" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns. ""The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,"" he added. Dominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a ""disaster"" for the industry. ""It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU."" New trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. UK asks EU to extend grace period for chilled meat British exports worth billions face EU tariffs Figures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. The combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. Compared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%. Exports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. Worst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved. For decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. However, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total. The FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. Overall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China. Sales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach Â£200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of Â£163m. On 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end. That meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. This FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed. ""Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,"" said Mr Goudie. ""If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.""

On Monday, Portugal captain Ronaldo removed two bottles of Coca-Cola and encouraged people to drink water. The next day, France midfielder Pogba, a practising Muslim, discreetlyremoved a bottleof Heineken beer. Italy's Manuel Locatelli also replaced Coca-Cola with water on Wednesday. ""Uefa has reminded participating teams that partnerships are integral to the delivery of the tournament and to ensuring the development of football across Europe, including for youth and women,"" tournament organisers said on Thursday. Uefa's Euro 2020 tournament director Martin Kallen said players were contractually obliged ""through their federation of the tournament regulations to follow"". However, he said he understood the actions of players who, like Pogba, did such things for religious reasons. Teams have been reminded of their contractual regulations and Kallen said disciplinary action was ""a possibility"". Uefa does not intend to directly fine players and any sanctions are at the discretion of the national federations. ""We are never fining players directly from the Uefa side, we will do this always through the participating national association and then they could look if they will go further to the player, but we are not going directly for the moment to the player,"" Kallen said.

David Guetta sells his songs for a nine-figure sum,"David Guetta rose from his roots as a club DJ in Paris to become one of the world's leading dance producers David Guetta, the producer behind hits like Titanium, I Got A Feeling and Hey Mama, has sold his back catalogue to Warner Music for a nine-figure sum. The French star made about $100m (Â£72m) in the deal, which also covers his future recordings, people familiar with the negotiations told the BBC. It comes amid a spending spree on hit songs, with Bob Dylan and Paul Simon's catalogues also selling for millions. Guetta is one of the biggest figures in pop and dance in the 21st Century. The 52-year-old has sold 50 million records and racked up more than 14 billion streams, and has worked with Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, The Black Eyed Peas, Nicki Minaj and Sia. Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit David Guetta: King of the streams Neil Young sells song rights in '$150m' deal Shakira is the latest star to sell her songs He started off as a DJ in Paris and Ibiza, making his name with an unauthorised remix of David Bowie's Heroes. His first UK number one was 2009's When Love Takes Over, recorded with Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland. He is currently back in the top 10 with the Little Mix collaboration Heartbreak Anthem.

A two-time Grammy winner, Guetta has helped shaped the sound of modern pop -helping introduce America to European dance music,externalthrough his production work the Black Eyed Peas'I Got A Feeling,external. ""It's rare for an artist to not only define a genre, but transform it,"" said Warner Music boss Max Lousada in a statement. ""David has been doing that for over two decades. ""He continues to have an extraordinary impact on the evolution of dance music, while innovating and collaborating with new voices in dynamic ways."" The acquisition of hit songs has become a major business over the last three years, as streaming opens up new revenue sources for classic hits. The London-based Hipgnosis Songs Fund has led the way, taking a 50% share in Neil Young's back catalogue, as well as obtaining the rights to music by Shakira, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Universal Music Group also spent a reported $300m (Â£288m) to acquire Bob Dylan's song catalogue; while Sony Music Group has spent $1.4 bn (Â£1bn) on music-related acquisitions in the six months to the end of May this year - including splashing out a nine-figure sum for Paul Simon's hits. The purpose of these deals is to allow investors to earn royalties every time one of those is played. Shakira, one of the most successful Latin recording artists of all time, raised millions by selling her song catalogue in January Investors usually seek out hits that have endured over decades, making Guetta's deal unusual, as his most popular songs were almost exclusively released in the last 10 years. The deal is unique in one other respect - in that Guetta has sold his master recordings, rather than his songwriting rights. It is still unusual for musicians to own their recordings, which are more typically in the control of record labels. However, Warner Music could be exposing itself to a certain amount of risk with its latest investment,according to industry website Music Business Worldwide,external. ""Some industry observers believe music like Guetta's best-known hits will ultimately be stung by a 'decay' in popularity,"" wrote Tim Ingham. ""Others point to the fact that a tune like Guetta'sTitanium,externalwas released 10 years ago, and continues to maintain a handsome level of streaming popularity."" Guetta is currently the world's eighth most-popular artist on Spotify. His manager, Jean-Charles CarrÃ©, said several companies had expressed an interest in buying the rights to his songs. In a statement, Guetta added: ""I'm super excited about the new music I'm working on. And even more excited that I have started to play all this new music live to my fans again and they are loving it. ""This deal is about having the best people around me to ensure I can keep innovating with exciting new projects, while also working my extensive catalogue and continuing to build my career.""

Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeeze,"The UK faces shortages of British-produced meat as problems with recruitment continue, the industry has warned. Brexit and coronavirus have meant many EU workers have returned to their own countries, putting a squeeze on production. The poultry industry is reporting a 10% fall in the number of birds being slaughtered for meat in recent weeks. But vegans said the labour shortage could ""spark much-needed change"". About a billion birds are slaughtered, prepared and packed in the UK per year, with the industry heavily reliant on EU nationals, especially for lower-skilled jobs. But migrants have been returning to their home countries due to Brexit effects including a weaker pound, a trend exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis, the British Poultry Council (BPC) said. Post-Brexit customs systems not fit for purpose, say meat exporters Brexit: 'My meat shipment is rotting in Rotterdam' Once they get home, many decide not to return. Meat producers have been trying to counter these effects by increasing automation and raising wages for workers. Nevertheless, skill shortages persist, especially in rural areas with high employment rates, the BPC said. The industry group called on the government to ease post-Brexit immigration rules to make it easier to attract EU workers. Chief executive Richard Griffiths said: ""We generally operate in areas of high local employment so there is a limit to availability of UK workers and there is negligible appetite from UK workers to move from other parts of the country. ""When it comes to non-UK labour - either from the EU or further afield - we have seen reducing numbers willing to come to the UK, the immigration barriers of salary and skill have been raised way beyond what we can manage, and the cost of bringing people is prohibitive."" Mr Griffiths warned that lack of supply could push up the cost of British meat. This risks creating a ""two-tier"" system where the UK imports food produced to lower standards, such as chlorinated chicken from the US, and only the affluent can afford higher quality British meat, the BPC said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was working hard to ensure that producers across the UK have the support and workforce that they need."" ""We would like to see the sector highlight the domestic opportunities available. Food and farming businesses will also be able to employ EU nationals with settled or pre-settled status to help meet their labour demand,"" it added. The beef, pork and lamb meat sector is also suffering a labour shortfall, an industry body said. The meat industry is ""two or three weeks away from a real problem"", British Meat Processors Association chief executive Nick Allen said. Some of the biggest meat producers are on the verge of telling farmers they do not have the capacity to process their livestock, he said. While it's good news that the hospitality industry is opening up as coronavirus restrictions relax, this is putting an added strain on meat production, he said. However, the Vegan Society said that the situation could have ecological and animal welfare benefits. It said low or no-meat lifestyles including veganism were becoming more popular as people realised the environmental benefits of eating plant-based proteins. People have been eating less meat over the past decade,most likely for environmental and health reasons,external, although consumption is still relatively high in the UK. ""This labour shortage could potentially spark much needed change, and be a positive outcome for animals and the environment,"" a Vegan Society spokeswoman said. ""We hope to see farmers gradually moving away from farming animals to growing crops for human consumption by providing food for the growing vegan population."" The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a non-departmental public body funded by a levy on farmers and growers, said that the number of households buying red meat increased by about 1% during the pandemic, while the number of households buying meat-free remained flat. There were rises in both meat and meat-free sales,it said,external. In addition, it said that more than 60% of agricultural land in the UK was only suitable for growing grass, and not suitable for crops.

Victoriaâs Secret hires Megan Rapinoe in rebrand,"(L-r) Models Winnie Harlow, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Alexina Graham appeared in Victoria's Secret's last show in 2018 Victoria's Secret is considering bringing back a ""re-imagined"" version of its runway show as the lingerie giant embarks on a ""dramatic shift"" for the brand. The annual event was scrapped in 2019 amid a wider cultural move away from its hyper-sexualised imagery. It comes as Victoria's Secret announced it had hired a line-up of new faces to promote the brand. They include football star Megan Rapinoe and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Ms Rapinoe and Ms Chopra Jonas, an actress and producer. will form part of ""The VS Collective"" a group of women who will work with the company on ""collaborations, business partnerships and cause-related initiatives"". Victoria's Secret was long famous for its annual fashion show where statuesque, supermodel ""Angels"" would strut the catwalk in little more than lingerie, feathers and gems. ""Angels"" like Gizele Oliveira will be replaced by women such as Megan Rapinoe as the face of Victoria's Secret The company still generates billions of dollars in sales. However, a cultural shift around the #metoo movement and body positivity saw rival companies such as Savage X Fenty - the underwear brand founded by singer and make-up mogul Rihanna - grow in popularity. More women were also choosing to buy comfortable, ""althleisure"" inspired underwear. Victoria's Secret held its last show in 2018 before confirming its cancellation the following year as viewing figures fell to 3.3 million. A spokesperson for Victoria's Secret said: ""As an entertainment brand, with a huge cultural footprint we are reimagining what a fashion show could look like for us in the future."" The company announced The VS Collective - which it described as ""a dramatic shift for our brand"" - as it prepares to cut ties with its parent company L Brands in a spin-off later this year. Martin Waters, Victoria's Secret chief executive - the fourth appointed in five years -told The New York Times,externalthat ""right now"" he did not see the Angels as being ""culturally relevant"". Ms Rapinoe, an LGBTQIA+ activist, was more blunt in her assessment of the company's past image, describing it as ""patriarchal, sexist, viewing not just what it meant to be sexy but what the clothes were trying to accomplish through a male lens and through what men desired"". She added that it was ""very much marketed toward younger women"", a message which she said was ""really harmful."" Musician and activist Margie Plus and model Soouizz both appeared in Savage X Fenty's show last year The Victoria's Secret show was the brainchild of L Brands' former chief marketing officer Ed Razek who resigned from the firm in 2019. The previous year he had come under fire for making a transphobic remark. He also said audiences had no interest in seeing plus-size models. Valentina Sampaio, an LGBTQIA+ activist who became Victoria's Secret's first openly transgender model two years ago just before Mr Razek resigned, has also joined the firm's ""collective"" alongside plus-sized model and ""body advocate"" Paloma Elsesser. Victoria's Secret was bought by billionaire Les Wexner in 1982. Mr Wexner, the former chief executive of L Brands, recently announced that he would not stand for re-election as chairman emeritus. Valentina Sampaio has joined Victoria's Secret's line up of ""icons and change-makers"" In 2019, Mr Wexner came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He employed Mr Epstein to manage his finances but cut ties with him in 2007. Mr Wexner said he was ""embarrassed"" by his friendship with Mr Epstein. Commenting on why Victoria's Secret was launching the new partnership now, Mr Waters told The New York Times: ""I've known that we needed to change this brand for a long time, we just haven't had the control of the company to be able to do it."" Mr Waters joined L Brands in 2008, overseeing its international division, before taking over as Victoria's Secret's new boss in November last year.

Minister apologises for failing rape victims,"This video can not be played Robert Buckland says ""sorry.. we have to do a lot better"" for victims of sexual offences Ministers have said they feel ""deeply ashamed"" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales. Speaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to ""do a lot better"". He also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years. The government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial. Its review also outlined plans,externalto focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day. The review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience. Labour said the government had ""failed victims of rape on every front"" and its recommendations did not go far enough. Laura Kuenssberg: Apology to rape victims matters, but actions count Why are rape prosecutions falling? Calls for rape victims to pre-record evidence Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed ""at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims"". ""The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough."" In a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: ""The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations. ""These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,"" they wrote. ""Victims of rape are being failed."" They went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. The trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said. ""We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,"" they added. This video can not be played Katherine: ""I feel really sad that it's taken this for them to listen"" Katherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped ""practically on the eve of the trial"" by the Crown Prosecution Service. She says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only ""very vague"". ""They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end."" She says she felt like ""it was my character"" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS ""really stung, and it still stings to this day"". ""That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,"" she says. ""They haven't learned their lessons."" Each year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. She cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not. ""The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,"" she said in the report. Plans set out in the report include: Introducing better data extraction technology to reduce the time that victims are without their phones - with an aim to have them returned by police within 24 hours. Currently this process can take months causing distress for victims left phoneless at a time when they most need support from friends and family Putting greater emphasis on understanding a suspect's behaviour rather than focusing on a victim's credibility Sparing victims the trauma of attending a courtroom trial by videoing their cross-examination earlier in the process and away from the courtroom. A pilot will be trialled in several courts, with a wider rollout considered. This measure is already used for children and vulnerable victims and witnesses The report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to ""at least 2016 levels"" and that regular ""scorecards"" would be published to monitor progress. The Law Commission will also begin a review into ""rape myths"" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence. There are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. The report argued it was due to ""a strained relationship"" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and ""an increase in invasive requests for their personal data"". Asked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. ""If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'â¦ all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,"" he said. In rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims. Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said,externalsome victims withdraw their complaints because ""they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy"". There have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. In November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. The victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government ""has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence"". Dame Vera said it was ""disheartening"" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. Labour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a ""real opportunity"" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape ""on every front âby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS"". She said ""piecemeal pilots"" and ""âtinkering"" would not be enough to fix the failures. Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was ""in disarray"". She said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt ""frustration and disappointment"" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. ""Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,"" she added. Amelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was ""a missed opportunity"". ""While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,"" she said. She called for ""independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police"" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service. Sumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding ""to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women"".

DUP revolt over first minister confirmation,"Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as first and deputy first ministers during a special meeting of the assembly on Thursday Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt. It comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not. The assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs. A meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. Those attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir. Leader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting. This video can not be played 'We will make this a better place for everyone' - Paul Givan Sammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was ""very, very clear"". ""What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,"" said the East Antrim MP. LIVE: Reaction as DUP row deepens after FM nomination Asked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should ""bring people along with them"" and that could not be achieved by ""ignoring the views of a huge number of people"". DUP leader Edwin Poots arrives at DUP headquarters ahead of a meeting of party officers on Thursday ""A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,"" he said. Asked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: ""Wait and see."" ""I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,"" he added. DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson says the first minister nomination should not have taken place on Thursday The first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night dealafter talks involving Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewisended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. But DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them ""to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn FÃ©in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister"". Signatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. Some DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands. Mr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was ""very clear"". ""It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme. Just over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way. There is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. It would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. If there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. It will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. That has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. While a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.

Officially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. Accepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader ""who had a big heart for the people around him"". Ms O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy. When Arlene Fosterstood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. They then had seven days to nominate replacements. Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Mr Poots had named Mr Givanas its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn FÃ©in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in theNew Decade, New Approach,externaldeal that restored power sharing in January 2020. The party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. Mr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. When a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly. ""However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,"" he said. ""If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021."" Brandon Lewis says Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step-in and legislate on Irish language commitments Mr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. ""Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,"" he said. ""Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive."" Mr Poots said his party had not been ""shirking away"" from NDNA, and said there was ""a lot in the cultural package for unionism"". He said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented. ""If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. ""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is now in pole position. He was the beaten contender, losing out by just two votes to Edwin Poots. But I think he is now being regarded by many in the party as the one who can bring that unifying presence, to reach out and heal some of the wounds. He has to reach out to the MLAs who were disillusioned with the previous leadership because he was part of that leadership. So he'll have a job of work to do to get everybody on to his page. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Paul Givan remains in place and the only way he can be removed from the post of first minister is if he resigns from the position. And there is no indication of that happening. I would be surprised if Edwin Poots did not raise the issue of Paul Givan's position at that discussion with party officers tonight whenever he agreed that he would tender his resignation. And I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Givan remains in that post until the new leader comes along, or even beyond that. The big focus of the DUP will be to now provide some stability and rather than reshuffling some of the key positions, they might try and let things settle a bit.  Allow Twitter content?

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent BBC News NI understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned
but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers. Party sources described the meeting as ârobustâ and said it
had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign. It is thought the process to appoint his successor could
move âat paceâ, according to one DUP figure. Doug Beattie and Edwin Poots officially took the leadership reigns on the same night. Tonight the Ulster Unionist leader says whoever follows Mr Poots as DUP leader will face the same issues. âThe
unedifying events around the DUP leadership were entirely inevitable. It
doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same
critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch. âUnionism
deserves better and Northern Ireland deserves better. Unionism needs modern,
confident, progressive leadership and a roadmap for recovery and renewal. The
Ulster Unionist Party will concentrate on providing that leadership and remains
a united, welcoming party that is looking to the future.  âFor
too long Unionism has been fed a diet of fear and negativity. We have the
talents and abilities to project a more confident, inclusive, vibrant brand of
Northern Ireland unionism across the United Kingdom and beyond. There are huge
challenges ahead, but by setting out a proper long-term strategy for the
future, we can lift unionism to a better place.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Victoriaâs Secret hires Megan Rapinoe in rebrandLingerie firm hopes partnerships with the likes of football star Megan Rapinoe will revamp the brand.,"(L-r) Models Winnie Harlow, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Alexina Graham appeared in Victoria's Secret's last show in 2018 Victoria's Secret is considering bringing back a ""re-imagined"" version of its runway show as the lingerie giant embarks on a ""dramatic shift"" for the brand. The annual event was scrapped in 2019 amid a wider cultural move away from its hyper-sexualised imagery. It comes as Victoria's Secret announced it had hired a line-up of new faces to promote the brand. They include football star Megan Rapinoe and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Ms Rapinoe and Ms Chopra Jonas, an actress and producer. will form part of ""The VS Collective"" a group of women who will work with the company on ""collaborations, business partnerships and cause-related initiatives"". Victoria's Secret was long famous for its annual fashion show where statuesque, supermodel ""Angels"" would strut the catwalk in little more than lingerie, feathers and gems. ""Angels"" like Gizele Oliveira will be replaced by women such as Megan Rapinoe as the face of Victoria's Secret The company still generates billions of dollars in sales. However, a cultural shift around the #metoo movement and body positivity saw rival companies such as Savage X Fenty - the underwear brand founded by singer and make-up mogul Rihanna - grow in popularity. More women were also choosing to buy comfortable, ""althleisure"" inspired underwear. Victoria's Secret held its last show in 2018 before confirming its cancellation the following year as viewing figures fell to 3.3 million. A spokesperson for Victoria's Secret said: ""As an entertainment brand, with a huge cultural footprint we are reimagining what a fashion show could look like for us in the future."" The company announced The VS Collective - which it described as ""a dramatic shift for our brand"" - as it prepares to cut ties with its parent company L Brands in a spin-off later this year. Martin Waters, Victoria's Secret chief executive - the fourth appointed in five years -told The New York Times,externalthat ""right now"" he did not see the Angels as being ""culturally relevant"". Ms Rapinoe, an LGBTQIA+ activist, was more blunt in her assessment of the company's past image, describing it as ""patriarchal, sexist, viewing not just what it meant to be sexy but what the clothes were trying to accomplish through a male lens and through what men desired"". She added that it was ""very much marketed toward younger women"", a message which she said was ""really harmful."" Musician and activist Margie Plus and model Soouizz both appeared in Savage X Fenty's show last year The Victoria's Secret show was the brainchild of L Brands' former chief marketing officer Ed Razek who resigned from the firm in 2019. The previous year he had come under fire for making a transphobic remark. He also said audiences had no interest in seeing plus-size models. Valentina Sampaio, an LGBTQIA+ activist who became Victoria's Secret's first openly transgender model two years ago just before Mr Razek resigned, has also joined the firm's ""collective"" alongside plus-sized model and ""body advocate"" Paloma Elsesser. Victoria's Secret was bought by billionaire Les Wexner in 1982. Mr Wexner, the former chief executive of L Brands, recently announced that he would not stand for re-election as chairman emeritus. Valentina Sampaio has joined Victoria's Secret's line up of ""icons and change-makers"" In 2019, Mr Wexner came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He employed Mr Epstein to manage his finances but cut ties with him in 2007. Mr Wexner said he was ""embarrassed"" by his friendship with Mr Epstein. Commenting on why Victoria's Secret was launching the new partnership now, Mr Waters told The New York Times: ""I've known that we needed to change this brand for a long time, we just haven't had the control of the company to be able to do it."" Mr Waters joined L Brands in 2008, overseeing its international division, before taking over as Victoria's Secret's new boss in November last year.

Wedding receptions to be judged on venue,"This video can not be played Covid weddings: ""We're having to choose between grandparents"" Rules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales are to change from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there would no longer be limits on numbers at weddings. Following a risk assessment by venues, numbers will be based on how many can be ""safely accommodated,"" he said. However, Mr Drakeford also announced afour-week pause to further lifting of lockdown rulesamid concerns over the Delta variant. ""We are once again facing a serious public health situation,"" he said. At a briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford alsowarned a third wave of coronavirushas already started to spread widely across Wales. What are the latest rules for weddings? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? 'No light at end of tunnel' for wedding businesses Currently, as many people as a venue can accommodate safely can attend wedding ceremonies, but only30 people can attend indoor wedding receptions. There are other rules, such as the first dance must only involve the bride and groom. Mr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: ""If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do."" He added it would mean ""at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now"". Among the ""small technical amendments"" being made to the lockdown rules are: The number of people who can attend a wedding or civil partnership reception or wake, organised by a business in an indoors regulated premise, such as a hotel, will be determined by the size of the venue and a risk assessment Small grassroots music and comedy venues will be able to operate on the same basis as hospitality venues, like pubs and cafes Primary school children in the same school contact group or bubble will be able to stay overnight in a residential outdoor education centre Pilot events in theatre, sport and other sectors will also continue throughout June and July Lockdown rules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July. Lewys Williams and Ms Harris were supposed to get married in August of last year but have had to reschedule twice. On one occasion this was because their venue was being turned into a mass vaccination centre. In a letter, also signed by brides-to-be other than Ms Harris and some wedding suppliers, the couple ask Mr Drakeford for a roadmap for weddings. And they have asked if lateral flow tests could be given to guests before they arrive. Lewys Williams and Ms Harris are planning their wedding for the third time ""We need clarity,"" Ms Harris said. ""We need a roadmap and we need to consider why on earth we are allowing sporting events of up to 10,000 people to go ahead, when we can't have our closest family and friends at our wedding. ""The level of worry, anxiety, mental health worries that this has caused. ""It sounds dramatic. But it really is every minute of every day, there some kind of worry going around my head at the moment. ""We don't know whether we go ahead and pay these suppliers, who within the next few weeks or so, are due the best part of six grand from us."" Crug Gas Country House, near St David's in Pembrokeshire, usually it hosts about 60 weddings a year - but because of the Covid lockdown rules, there have been three this year so far. ""At weddings here it's table service-only and only the bride and groom are allowed to dance - it's really sad,"" Crug Glas' wedding coordinator Sandra Vaughantold BBC Radio Cymru. ""It's quite hard to see people out enjoying the football in the pubs, but nobody can come here to have a nice wedding. It's not the same product we sold to them."" Fans were at a fan zone near Cardiff for Wales' victory against Turkey Welsh government officials are talking to councils about the possibility of fan zones for Wales' remaining Euro 2020 games, Mr Drakeford said. Hundreds gathered at one indoor venue near Cardiff forWales' 2-0 victory over Turkey, with hopes larger outdoor facilities will be opened. However, Mr Drakeford said conversations were taking place with experts and police about the viability of accommodating the ""large numbers of people"" fan zones would attract. The announcement comes as Wales' overall case rate has continued to climb since late May. There are close to 500 cases of the Delta variant, which originated in India, accounting for four out of every five new cases in Wales, latest figures show, with Mr Drakeford saying it is ""seeded in every part of Wales"". He believes it could be a fortnight before the impact of this is seen in hospital admissions and people falling ill. ""Across the border in Scotland and England, they are about two weeks ahead of us on all of this,"" he added. ""We are already seeing hospital numbers rising, particularly amongst people in their forties and fifties. ""That's why we will use the next four weeks to accelerate or vaccination programme."" How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief How many people have died with Covid in Wales? More than 500,000 doses of the Covid vaccine will be distributed across Wales in a bid to speed up the number of people receiving second jabs. So far 1,454,066 people have been fully vaccinated. Mr Drakeford said restrictions could be eased following the four-week pause even if there is not conclusive evidence that vaccinations have broken the link between rising infections and hospital admissions. He told the PA news agency: ""I agree that you cannot, in the end, delay everything in the search for perfection in terms of data. ""But what we are quite clearly told by our scientific advisers as well as others is that this four weeks will allow us to get a sufficiently good handle on the extent to which a relationship between falling ill and needing hospitalisation has been modified by the vaccine. ""Then we will make a calculation about how much headroom we have, as we always do, to take further steps."" Responding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Many in hospitality are still feeling the pinch from the unexplained gap in funding in April of this year."" He said, while clarity on wedding venues would be welcome, he called on the Welsh government to ""provide leadership and support at a time when many have genuine fears for the future"". Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies wants the move to be scrutinised in the Welsh Parliament. He added: ""In light of the ongoing restrictions, Welsh businesses will require more financial support and I hope the first minister makes clear what additional funding his government will provide to protect Welsh jobs.""

No major lockdown easing in Wales before July,"As cases rise, sources say there will not be big changes in the rules for the next four weeks Covid restrictions in Wales are unlikely to be significantly relaxed until July because of concern about the Delta variant, BBC Wales has been told. Welsh government sources are downplaying expectations ahead of a scheduled announcement by First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. Ministers have been looking at permitting more people to meet indoors. But, as cases rise, sources say there will not be big changes in the rules for the next four weeks. Cabinet ministers met on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the latest scientific evidence. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Wedding bells? The Covid do's and dont's Restrictions on outdoor gatherings were eased earlier in June as part of a phased introduction of Alert Level One - the lowest level on the Welsh government's coronavirus control plan. Ministers have been reviewing the situation before deciding whether other restrictions could be relaxed on 21 June. Potential rule changes included allowing any six people to meet inside private homes, allowing more people to attend indoor events and re-opening ice skating rinks. Earlier this week Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said original plans to scrap Covid lockdown rules in England on 21 June werenever considered sensibleby the Welsh government. He said it had not been right to set out such a commitment when the pandemic caused ""unpleasant surprises"". Boris Johnson has confirmed the final stage of lockdown easing in England will be delayed until 19 July. Can I go on holiday abroad from Wales? Headaches and runny nose linked to Delta variant Wales' infection rate has risen from under 10 to 22 infections per 100,000 people since the start of the month as cases have risen. Wales has reported 100 new positive tests a day on average in the past seven days, an upturn which might be expected as things continue to open up, with clusters in local areas driving the overall increase. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? Mr Drakeford will announce the next steps in a press conference on Friday, but sources say only ""minor"" changes are likely. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This does not come as a surprise, particularly in light of the concerns over the Delta variant."" He said the Welsh government should consider easing some of the restrictions on weddings and funerals and ongoing restrictions would mean businesses would  require more financial support. Plaid Cymru called on the Welsh government to ""provide leadership and support"" for the hospitality sector, where it said many had ""genuine fears for the future"". Deputy leader and health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth also said ""caution must be taken"". ""Set against a backdrop of the Delta variant, and talk of further lockdowns, this is giving genuine worry for a whole industry,"" he said.

"Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief","NHS Wales waiting times are due to be published amid a growing backlog of patients The Welsh NHS is under ""substantial pressure"" as services return to pre-pandemic levels, its chief executive has warned. Dr Andrew Goodall said the need to continue with Covid-19 precautions meant a ""difficult combination"" of factors was straining the system. Monthly waiting times show another rise, amid a growing backlog of patients waiting for treatment. One doctors' group has called for a radical reorganisation of services. Data from April showed there were 595,272 people on waiting lists in Wales - this has risen again on March and isup 29% on pre-pandemic levels. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it was a ""massive uphill task"" to clear the backlog and did not rule out establishing regional hubs. ""We've made it very clear it probably will take the whole length of this Senedd term [five years] to get us back to pre pandemic levels,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""We had to pause non-emergency care, that has created a massive challenge for us, but we've already put Â£100m on the table to get our health boards to shift some of that [backlog]."" We can see in April, 223,365 people were waiting more than 36 weeks or nine months for hospital treatment. When we look at specialist areas, in trauma and orthopaedics there were 52,822 people waiting more than nine months. This is a 527% increase on the pre-pandemic total in February 2020. Altogether, there are 87,918orthopaedic and trauma patientswaiting for treatment. Those waiting the longest forgeneral surgeryhave also hit a new high - 26,943, 12 times the numbers waiting before the pandemic. In February 2020, 252 people had been waiting more than nine months forcardiology treatment,and by April this year there were 4,159 people with long waits. The number on that list has risen slightly after falling for four successive months. Numbers waiting the longest forcardiothoracic surgeryare still falling although there are still 136 patients - three times the numbers before the pandemic hit. While two people were waiting more than nine months before the pandemic in February 2020 forrestorative dental work, that has now increased to 625, although has fallen for the fifth successive month Forneurology treatments, numbers rose from 22 to 906 from pre-pandemic to April. Cancer charity Tenovus said 13,480 people in Wales were referred to the Suspected Cancer Pathway April - the second consecutive time the monthly figure has exceeded the pre-pandemic average monthly figure of 13,208. ""This is a chink of light that gives us optimism that, as the Covid-19 pandemic begins to subside, we can avert a cancer pandemic through a combination of public awareness-raising and investment in our health service,"" said chief executive Judi Rhys. Attendances at emergency departments have also returned to pre-pandemic levels, and NHS Wales said that one health board experienced its busiest-ever day for A&E attendances on Monday. In May, there were more than 81,000 A&E attendances, nearly 5,000 more than in February 2020. The NHS Wales chief executive added that planned treatments were now at 70% of normal levels. Dr Goodall said: ""It is a substantial pressure, I think it is substantial for different reasons. NHS staff want to make sure that we are able to support our patients across Wales and make sure that they can be seen within the appropriate and right level of services. ""But they are having to balance a growth in emergency pressures back to normal levels. ""They are still having to protect both staff and patients working around them. And they are the same staff who have been there through the pandemic, who are having to focus on the new services, to make sure people are supported as well."" Dr Andrew Goodall says Covid precautions mean a ""difficult combination"" of factors are straining the system Health boards have been asked to come up with innovative ways of dealing with the backlog, and an initial Â£100m of new funding has been made available by the Welsh government to try to bring waiting lists down. Pilot schemes have begun in some areas to reduce waiting times or improve the quality of life for those who will continue to face the longest delays in their treatment. Surgical teams at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend have already seen a significant reduction in waiting times for patients referred for urgent treatment after visiting A&E or their GP. The Ambulatory Emergency Surgical Unit was launched at the hospital before the pandemic to allow patients to be assessed, diagnosed and treated - often on the same day. They do not need to be seen by separate medical teams or admitted as an inpatient. Covid innovations 'will reshape future NHS' A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' The model was so efficient it has since been expanded to emergency medical admissions, and will be implemented for emergency gynaecology admissions from 1 July. Consultant surgeon Simon Weaver said the system had allowed about 80% of patients to be seen and treated within three hours, compared with about 30% before it was introduced. ""When it comes to resetting services it's really important that we're a getting a bang for our buck,"" he said. ""We've got to take this as an opportunity to restart the NHS."" The Ambulatory Emergency Surgical Unit has slashed treatment times, consultant surgeon Simon Weaver says While local innovations will help reduce some pressures, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has called for the creation of non-Covid hubs to tackle waiting lists. Richard Johnson, the director of RCS in Wales, said: ""There is now an urgency to develop these sites and have a radical rethink of how the NHS is working in Wales. ""We are looking at these sites for planned treatments. We are not talking about new sites, we are talking about a reorganisation of the sites we have in Wales already."" Mr Johnson said an RCS survey found patients were prepared to travel in order to be treated at new hubs across Wales. And he said there needed to be ""an open and honest discussion"" about the implications of not changing the way hospitals are currently organised. Dr Goodall said many changes had been implanted already, including greater use of technology in connecting patients to clinicians. He added it was ""inevitable that we're going to have to have more regional solutions, with health boards working alongside each other to achieve that"". ""And I know there's a lot of clinical support for that to happen in Wales."" The health minister said the Welsh government was currently looking at ways to fund such hubs. Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said there was a ""long road ahead"" for the NHS in Wales to recover from the pandemic. He urged the public to continue using services responsibly, adding: ""It's the same exhausted staff who have worked tirelessly over the last 15 months that will be required to deliver services and ultimately help tackle waiting lists. ""We can't thank them enough for all they've done for the people of Wales, and we must remember that as we begin the next chapter of recovery, they too need to recover."" Cases of the Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, remain comparatively low in Wales compared with England. Dr Goodall said the next two to four weeks would be crucial in determining whether a further increase in cases in Wales would result in a spike in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? He said: ""Numbers associated with a Delta variant remain very low in Wales from a hospital perspective, although they're increasing in terms of community cases. So we're tracking it very carefully. ""But inevitably there will be some impact in Wales and it's why, in part, I know that the first minister and the cabinet made decisions to defer some arrangements earlier on during this month, because it was to try and allow for more vaccination coverage for the population, which will provide a higher level of protection.""

Tartan Army heads south for Friday's England game,"This video can not be played Euro 2020: Scotland fans arrive in London for game against England Thousands of Scotland fans are heading south ahead of the team's game against England on Friday night. Train operators said many services were sold out to fans travelling to London for the Euro 2020 match at Wembley. With tickets limited due to Covid restrictions, fans have been urged not to travel unless they have organised a place to watch the game. However, some supporters groups have criticised the tournament organisers for not setting up a fan zone. Ticketless Scotland fans asked not to visit London Fan zone ticket holders to be sent testing kits Paul Goodwin, founder of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""So many Scotland fans are just so excited about the prospect. ""All these other [Covid] considerations that we've got, I think they are mindful of it. Undoubtedly it's not going to be same as normal. ""But I'm really disappointed that there isn't going to be a fan zone there, in a city the size of London."" It's thirsty work just getting to the Euros for some fans Loyal Tartan Army footsoldier Paul has chosen not to travel down for the match on this occasion - but he said it was inevitable that thousands of others would. He said: ""In some respects, this is the most important fixture in Scottish football because of the historical consequences and the fact that it doesn't come around all that often. ""I think it's just a unique part of the super-loyalty that football fans have. They feel they have to be part of it. ""We can't go out and kick a ball on the park, but we can be part of that unique aspect that the Tartan Army brings."" Singing fans set out on their way to London from Glasgow By BBC Scotland's Steven Godden, in London For Scotland fans games don't come bigger than England at Wembley. Tickets or no tickets, the thousands who've travelled weren't about to miss it. The journey has been a mixture of planes, trains and automobiles. The London Mayor was among those asking fans not to travel unless they have somewhere safe to watch the game. And so, behind their masks on the morning flight from Edinburgh, kilted supporters were working out their plans for bar bookings. At Kings Cross station, meanwhile, the swollen crowds underneath the old clock signalled the arrival of another train from Scotland. Every time it was the cue for a quick, enthusiastic rattle through the Tartan Army songbook - ""Super John McGinn"" a particular favourite - before fans started to spread out across the pubs and parks of London. With the traditional gathering point Trafalgar Square off limits, Leicester Square seems like a popular alternative this evening. Hundreds of fans have gathered there. They're loud, well oiled and it didn't take long for the first one to find his way into the fountain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scotland lost their first game 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Iain Meiklejohn and his son Aleks, from Edinburgh, tweeted: ""There are road trips, then there's a Wembley road trip!"" Ticketless fans have beenurged not to travel to Londonunless they have organised somewhere to watch the match because space to congregate will be limited. Wembley will be open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. And Scotland fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square meeting place as it will be reserved as a fan zone for key workers. Pubs and bars in London are also expected to limit numbers allowed in. Scotland fans were in full cry as they headed south Hamish Husband, from the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, said it was ""a bit late"" to tell fans not to travel without a place to watch the match because the minute people knew Scotland were playing England, they had booked to go. Mr Husband told BBC Scotland's the Nine there should have been more Covid-safe outdoor events offered for fans wanting to go to London. ""It's a no win situation,"" he added. He said his plea to football fans was that they must ""follow the guidelines."" ""If you're going to go down - and they are on their way - just, behave yourselves,"" he said. The one fan in London not wearing a kilt will be easy to spot Many supporters have chosen to travel down early for the match. LNER, which operates the services from Edinburgh to London's Kings Cross, said its services were sold out for both Thursday and Friday. It said its services were reservation only, and urged customers to only travel to the station if they already had a booking. Avanti West Coast, which operates the Glasgow to London line, said capacity on services had been reduced to about 40% due to social distancing. Liam McKechnie, from Edinburgh, boogied his way down to London on the train A spokesman said: ""We're monitoring demand closely and also looking at extra trains before and after the match. ""We're also reminding customers to travel safely by wearing a face covering unless they're exempt as well as strongly urging fans to plan ahead and only travel if they have a reservation."" On Thursday, a piper will play for queuing fans heading to London from Glasgow's Central Station. Scotland fans from Falkirk were among the first to leave Glasgow on Thursday morning British Transport Police said extra officers would be on duty. BTP's Supt Ricky Twyford said: ""Throughout Euro 2020, we'll have more officers at key stations and routes supporting fans, frontline rail staff and everyone else travelling during this busy time. ""In the lead up to and day of the England v Scotland game, there'll be an even further increase in officers, and we'll be working closely with Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police to ensure people's journeys are safe and secure, and disruption is kept to a minimum."" LNER services are currently alcohol free, but customers will be able to drink onboard Avanti services. Kev Lynch was among a team of football fans from the north east who set off for London on Wednesday On Wednesday night, one dedicated group of 25 or so football fans who managed to get tickets set off for Wembley from the north east. They have hired a bus to - safely, and following social distancing rules - take them down to London. Among them was Kev Lynch, 36, who told BBC Scotland he'd been away with the Tartan Army quite a few times - but this would be their first time since the pandemic began. ""Because of the restrictions, a lot of the boys didn't get tickets - we'd usually have had 50+ in normal times. ""It's the biggest game we've had in a long time."" A contingent of dedicated Tartan Army supporters from the north east are making their way to London by bus He said the excitement on Friday night would be even more intense, after Scotland ""slipped up"" by being defeated by the Czech side on Monday. ""It will be the biggest game I have been to"" since the early 2000s, he said. ""The last time Scotland got to major finals I was still in secondary school. ""The fact it's England makes it a double bonus - the auld enemy,"" adding that it would make a victory ""even sweeter"". The group will be joined later by more fans, who are flying down to join them. Because the group of about 40 have been unable to book into the same pub, they have hired a boat on the Thames to watch earlier coverage, before heading to Wembley for the Scotland match. Kev said the bus journey home would be brilliant if Scotland win - but added: ""If there's a loss, it will be a long way home."". Are you watching the Scotland-England game?

Man jailed for leaving girl to die on hill,"Mhari O'Neill's body was discovered on Edinburgh's Calton Hill in December 2018 A man who caused the death of an underage girl by buying her alcohol and abandoning her on a winter's night has been jailed for more than three years. When Ewan Fulton left 15-year-old Mhari O'Neill, she was not wearing a jacket and was too drunk to walk. A dog walker found her body on Edinburgh's Calton Hill the next morning. on 7 December 2018. Fulton, who was 18, later told a friend: ""That girl has a family and if I had stayed she would be alive."" Pathologists have decided the probable cause of the teenager's death was hypothermia. Ewan Fulton was aged 18 at the time of Mhari's death Sentencing Fulton to three years and two months at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Norman McFadyen said he had no justification for leaving Mhari. ""You were clearly thinking but thinking about yourself,"" he said. ""The decent thing would have been to stay with her and seek help. ""Even an anonymous 999 call would have secured the help that she needed...you panicked and left her."" The court heard that Fulton befriended Mhari through the social media site Yubo. Man left girl to die on hill in freezing weather Man accused of sexual assault and death of teenager He bought a one litre bottle of vodka for them to share after he travelled to Edinburgh from Livingston to meet her. Fulton said there was heavy petting and admitted a charge of sexual activity with a child. He had bitten the teenager's breasts and compressed her neck. They had shared the vodka equally, which Fulton said left Mhari ""obviously drunk. It was like she had lost all motor skills, she was too drunk to do anything."" Fulton said she kept falling off the bench and could not walk. He claimed he needed to get the last train home and told her he was leaving, but did not get a response as she was ""unable to speak."" The next day he sent her texts stating ""Are you alive?"" In a message to a friend he wrote ""I had no choice but to leave what was I supposed to do."" Fulton pleaded guilty last month to culpable homicide. He admitted taking part in sexual activity with the schoolgirl, culpably and recklessly endangering her health and life, and exposing her to risk of injury and death. The culpable homicide charge said Fulton left her without the means to contact anyone, had failed to get help for her, and behaved with ""utter disregard"" for the consequences of his actions. The court heard that Fulton later attempted suicide. His defence counsel Shelagh McColl QC said he would have to live with what had happened for the rest of his life: ""He was a young man who would have been under the influence of alcohol himself and he's a young man who has made a bad decision with catastrophic consequences,"" she said.

Jeff Bezos-backed fusion plant to be built in UKCanadian company General Fusion is set to build a $400m fusion demonstrator near Oxford.Science & Environment,"An artist's impression of what the new demonstration plant might look like A company backed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos is set to build a large-scale nuclear fusion demonstration plant in Oxfordshire. Canada'sGeneral Fusion,externalis one of the leading private firms aiming to turn the promise of fusion into a commercially viable energy source. The new facility will be built at Culham, home to the UK's national fusion research programme. It won't generate power, but will be 70% the size of a commercial reactor. General Fusion will enter into a long-term commercial lease with theUK Atomic Energy Authority,externalfollowing the construction of the facility at the Culham campus. While commercial details have not been disclosed, the development is said to cost around $400m. It aims to be operational by 2025. UK experiment could sweep aside fusion hurdle Mind-boggling magnets could unlock plentiful power 'UK first' nuclear fusion plan for power station Fusion is the process by which the Sun generates energy. Harnessing it here on Earth is seen as a critical step towards greener nuclear power. It differs from the traditional nuclear approach by attempting to fuse atoms together rather than splitting them. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has been an investor for over a decade In theory, fusion promises a safer, carbon-free energy source that produces very little radioactive waste. But getting atoms to fuse together at temperatures several times hotter than the surface of the Sun has proven a huge technological and financial challenge. Amajor international effort to build a fusion reactoris underway in the south of France with the Iter project. But this $20bn dollar venture has been hampered by delays and isn't likely to be working effectively until after 2035. Frustrated by the slow progress, private companies across the world have been following their own approaches, and General Fusion's effort is seen as one of the most advanced. Backed by Jeff Bezos for over a decade, the company raised $100m in its last round of funding and is preparing to go back to investors for more cash to show that the firm's technology can be successfully scaled up. The company uses an approach called magnetised target fusion. In this process, a super-heated gas called a plasma, consisting of a particular form of hydrogen, is injected into a cylinder which is surrounded by a wall of liquid metal. Hundreds of pneumatic pistons are then used to compress the plasma until the atoms fuse, generating massive amounts of heat. This heat is transferred by the liquid metal, and used to boil water and make steam to drive a turbine.

""Coming to Culham gives us the opportunity to benefit from UKAEA's expertise,"" said Christofer Mowry, the chief executive of General Fusion. ""By locating at this campus, General Fusion expands our market presence beyond North America into Europe, broadening our global network of government, institutional, and industrial partners. ""This is incredibly exciting news for not only General Fusion, but also the global effort to develop practical fusion energy."" The decision to locate the demonstration plant in Oxfordshire was made possible by funding from the UK government, with the monetary amount described by Christofer Mowry in wire agency reports as ""very meaningful"". While UK ministers were positive about the development, they wouldn't be drawn on the amount of taxpayer's money involved. The government says the agreement with General Fusion will support hundreds of jobs both in Oxfordshire and beyond, during the 3-year construction phase, as well as many others during the operational phase. They say it will complement the government's commitment of Â£222m for the UKAEA's Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (Step) programme, which aims to design and build the world's first prototype fusion power plant by 2040. ""This new plant by General Fusion is a huge boost for our plans to develop a fusion industry in the UK, and I'm thrilled that Culham will be home to such a cutting-edge and potentially transformative project,"" said UK Science Minister Amanda Solloway.

âUnforgivable' security mistakes before arena bomb,"This video can not be played Paul Price and his partner, Elaine McIver, were at the Manchester Arena when the bomb exploded Paul Price does not know how close he was to death on the night of the Manchester Arena bombing. Though he remained awake in the horrific minutes that followed, he has barely any memory of it, and for that he is grateful. His injuries were catastrophic, a seemingly endless catalogue of destruction from which his body will never fully recover. Dozens of surgeries. Shrapnel still embedded in his body. Permanent loss of function in his hand and leg. Weekly painful rehab sessions. But nothing compares to the loss of his partner Elaine McIver, who was among the 22 people killed when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device. ""She was the love of my life, I was the love of her life"", he said. For a long time he could not bring himself to talk about her. ""It was just too upsetting,"" he said. ""And I'm ashamed to say it, but for such a long time I remember thinking my hurt was so much that I thought if someone could give me a tablet and I could forget about her, I'd be OK. ""Now her memory to me is a blessing and I love talking about her. And I'm glad of that."" ""She was the love of my life,"" says Paul Price about Elaine McIver Ms McIver was a detective constable who had worked for Cheshire Police and the North West regional crime unit Titan. She was 43 when she died - off duty and with Mr Price to collect his daughter from the Ariana Grande concert. Mr Price describes how much pride she took in her work and how proud she was to be a police officer, helping to keep people safe. It has only made it harder to learn about failings in security in May 2017, which he believes made it ""easy"" for the bomber to slip through the net, unchallenged by anyone in authority. On Thursday, the first findings from the inquiry will be made public. The report will focus on the security arrangements at the arena, and is likely to be critical. Mr Price said: ""They all say we will learn from this... I don't know. ""The failings go back a long time, so many missed chances and it's hard to hear. ""There were failings on the night but the weeks, months before made it easy for him and it shouldn't have been so easy."" Elaine McIver was one of 22 people killed in the May 2017 bombing Who were the people killed in the attack? On the night Abedi murdered Ms McIver and 21 others, he hid for nearly an hour in a CCTV blind spot in the foyer of the Manchester Arena - a public area connected to the railway station next door. It was a spot the bomber had planned carefully in repeated hostile reconnaissance trips over previous days. It was here he waited as parents and families gathered to collect loved ones leaving the concert, and it was here that he walked into the crowd at 22:31 BST and blew himself up. Hours of CCTV examined by the inquiry show Abedi earlier walking around the station, bent under the weight of his bulging rucksack, and at one point fiddling with wires sticking out of his clothes. Mr Price said he has felt particularly upset by revelations at the inquiry about the behaviour of British Transport Police (BTP), who were responsible for policing the station and foyer areas. He has learned that against instructions, there was no police officer stationed in the foyer for the end of the concert. ""I didn't want to be let down by BTP, but I was,"" he said. ""And I think that hurt more than anything because Elaine was a police officer."" Though they raced to help after the bomb went off, the officers on duty that night have been criticised for their behaviour in the hours leading up to the atrocity - including a two-hour dinner break and a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab. At one point, when Abedi took his final trip through the station to his hiding place in the foyer, there were no BTP officers on duty in the area at all. Mr Price said: ""After the explosion there was heroics and you know, they stepped up, but the failings before the explosion were unforgivable as far as I'm concerned. ""They were there to protect, and they weren't there."" BTP has accepted the attack happened on its watch and it let the public down, but it says its officers did act with heroism following the explosion. But it was not only BTP who were responsible for keeping people safe in that area. Arena operators SMG and its contracted event security providers Showsec also shared responsibility. Paul Price says he is ""working on his recovery and trying to look forwards"" For Mr Price, he feels there has been a sense of blame being shifted and an unwillingness by corporations to admit failings in their preparedness for an attack of this kind. He said: ""I was disappointed in SMG and Showsec to begin with, because they just seemed to be passing the buck between one another. ""I thought - just admit the failings and try and learn from it. But it just seemed to be that they just didn't want the blame on them."" SMG, Showsec and British Transport Police have all accepted shortcomings in their risk assessments. But SMG said other accusations that it prioritised profit over safety were unfair, while Showsec said its own errors did not contribute to the bombing. Today will be yet another difficult day for Mr Price and all those impacted by the atrocity at Manchester Arena. Meanwhile, he is still working on his recovery and trying to look forwards. He said: ""For such a long time I thought I could never be happy again, I felt life was a prison sentence I had to endure... the world seems a lonely place now, and frightening for me. ""But you know, I can see glimmers of light now... I am still alive, I've got to live my life for my kids, for everyone who's helped me. ""A lot of people have invested a lot of time in me to get me back on my feet. I can't let them down, and I can't let Elaine down.""

"Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeezeUK faces shortage of home-reared chickens as EU workers stay away, says trade group.","The UK faces shortages of British-produced meat as problems with recruitment continue, the industry has warned. Brexit and coronavirus have meant many EU workers have returned to their own countries, putting a squeeze on production. The poultry industry is reporting a 10% fall in the number of birds being slaughtered for meat in recent weeks. But vegans said the labour shortage could ""spark much-needed change"". About a billion birds are slaughtered, prepared and packed in the UK per year, with the industry heavily reliant on EU nationals, especially for lower-skilled jobs. But migrants have been returning to their home countries due to Brexit effects including a weaker pound, a trend exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis, the British Poultry Council (BPC) said. Post-Brexit customs systems not fit for purpose, say meat exporters Brexit: 'My meat shipment is rotting in Rotterdam' Once they get home, many decide not to return. Meat producers have been trying to counter these effects by increasing automation and raising wages for workers. Nevertheless, skill shortages persist, especially in rural areas with high employment rates, the BPC said. The industry group called on the government to ease post-Brexit immigration rules to make it easier to attract EU workers. Chief executive Richard Griffiths said: ""We generally operate in areas of high local employment so there is a limit to availability of UK workers and there is negligible appetite from UK workers to move from other parts of the country. ""When it comes to non-UK labour - either from the EU or further afield - we have seen reducing numbers willing to come to the UK, the immigration barriers of salary and skill have been raised way beyond what we can manage, and the cost of bringing people is prohibitive."" Mr Griffiths warned that lack of supply could push up the cost of British meat. This risks creating a ""two-tier"" system where the UK imports food produced to lower standards, such as chlorinated chicken from the US, and only the affluent can afford higher quality British meat, the BPC said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was working hard to ensure that producers across the UK have the support and workforce that they need."" ""We would like to see the sector highlight the domestic opportunities available. Food and farming businesses will also be able to employ EU nationals with settled or pre-settled status to help meet their labour demand,"" it added. The beef, pork and lamb meat sector is also suffering a labour shortfall, an industry body said. The meat industry is ""two or three weeks away from a real problem"", British Meat Processors Association chief executive Nick Allen said. Some of the biggest meat producers are on the verge of telling farmers they do not have the capacity to process their livestock, he said. While it's good news that the hospitality industry is opening up as coronavirus restrictions relax, this is putting an added strain on meat production, he said. However, the Vegan Society said that the situation could have ecological and animal welfare benefits. It said low or no-meat lifestyles including veganism were becoming more popular as people realised the environmental benefits of eating plant-based proteins. People have been eating less meat over the past decade,most likely for environmental and health reasons,external, although consumption is still relatively high in the UK. ""This labour shortage could potentially spark much needed change, and be a positive outcome for animals and the environment,"" a Vegan Society spokeswoman said. ""We hope to see farmers gradually moving away from farming animals to growing crops for human consumption by providing food for the growing vegan population."" The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a non-departmental public body funded by a levy on farmers and growers, said that the number of households buying red meat increased by about 1% during the pandemic, while the number of households buying meat-free remained flat. There were rises in both meat and meat-free sales,it said,external. In addition, it said that more than 60% of agricultural land in the UK was only suitable for growing grass, and not suitable for crops.

Naomi Osaka will not play at WimbledonNaomi Osaka will not play at Wimbledon this year but is planning to return in time for the Tokyo Olympics.BBC Sport,"Osaka has twice reached the third round at the All England Club Japan's Naomi Osaka will not play at Wimbledon this year but is planning to return in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The four-time Grand Slam champion will spend time with friends and family having also withdrawn from the French Open in May. At the time, Osaka, 23, said she would betaking a break from tennisafter experiencing depression and anxiety. The world number two says she is ""excited to play in front of her home fans"" in Tokyo. Osaka was fined $15,000 (Â£10,570) for not taking part in a news conference following her first round match at Roland Garros. Grand Slam organisers said she could face expulsion from the tournament should she refuse to take part in media duties. But the player withdrew from the tournament the following day, saying she needed to ""protect her mental health"". ""When the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans,"" she added at the time. Wimbledon's chief executive Sally Bolton had earlier revealed the All England Club (AELTC) had been in contact with Osaka's team and was actively looking at ways to improve its media operations. ""We have started a consultation,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""Of course, that consultation needs to include not just the players, but the media and all of those engaged in that space."" Wimbledon tournament director Jamie Baker said on Wednesday that he had told Osaka's entourage that the phone lines were always open to discuss any issues that might arise. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller A Wimbledon appearance by Naomi Osaka has seemed extremely unlikely ever since she withdrew from the French Open. But what is very encouraging is that the 23-year-old feels able to represent her country at her home Olympics in just six weeks' time. The shorter-than-usual two-week gap between the French Open and Wimbledon may not have made any difference to Osaka's decision, but has repercussions for others -most notably Rafael Nadal. The 35-year-old ultimately had to choose between the two Grand Slams. Roger Federer is one who will empathise. The 39-year-old withdrew from Roland Garros after three rounds to protect his knee, but also his chances of being truly competitive at Wimbledon.

Nadal out of Wimbledon and the Olympics,"Nadal lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to long-time rival Roger Federer in 2019 World number three Rafael Nadal has pulled out of this month's Wimbledon and the Tokyo Olympic Games. The 20-time Grand Slam champion, who won the Wimbledon titles in 2008 and 2010, says he needs to ""recuperate after a long clay-court season"". ""It's never an easy decision but after listening to my body and discussing it with my team I understand that it is the right decision,"" said the Spaniard. ""The goal is to prolong my career and continue to do what makes me happy."" The 35-year-old added: ""That is to compete at the highest level and keep fighting for those professional and personal goals at the maximum level of competition."" Nadal: The 'tough love' that shaped a 20-time Grand Slam champion Wimbledon contacts Osaka as it looks to revamp media operation Murray and Williams given Wimbledon wildcards Nadal hinted at the decision after hisdefeat by Serbia's world number oneNovak Djokovic in the French Open semi-finals last week. If defending champion Djokovic wins the title at the All England Club, it will move him level with the record shared by Nadal and Switzerland's Roger Federer of 20 men's major singles titles. Nadal said the shorter turnaround between the French Open and Wimbledon - which starts at the All England Club on 28 June - was a key factor in his decision. This year, there are only two weeks between the French Open finishing on the clay and Wimbledon starting on the grass. Usually, there are three weeks between the two majors. The French Open was pushed back a week by Roland Garros organisers in order to start the tournament with fewer of the country's coronavirus restrictions in place - including allowing fans in to watch. ""The fact that there has only been two weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon didn't make it easier on my body to recuperate after the always demanding clay-court season,"" Nadal said in a Twitter post announcing the news. ""They have been two months of great effort and the decision I take is focused looking at the mid and long term."" Rafael Nadal carried the Spanish flag at the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games Nadal struggled with a back injury earlier this year, playing only the Australian Open - where he lost in the quarter-finals - before the clay-court season started in mid-April. On his favourite surface the Mallorcan left-hander won the titles in Barcelona and Rome before losing to Djokovic at Roland Garros. ""Sport prevention of any kind of excess in my body is a very important factor at this stage of my career in order to try to keep fighting for the highest level of competition and titles,"" Nadal added. The decision also means he will miss the delayed Olympics, which start in Tokyo on 23 July. Nadal has won two Olympic gold medals - in the singles atBeijing 2008,externaland the doubles at Rio 2016. ""The Olympic Games always meant a lot and they were always a priority as a sportsperson, I found the spirit that every sportsperson in the world wants to live,"" Nadal said. ""I personally had the chance to live three of them and had the honour to be the flagbearer for my country."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Nadal hinted at this very outcome after losing a brutal four-hour French Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic in Paris last Friday. A two-week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon could lead to quite an unpredictable fortnight on the grass, as players have less time than usual to recover physically and to make the transition from clay. And, sadly, it has also contributed to Nadal's decision. He already has two Olympic gold medals, and must feel his best chance this year of winning a Grand Slam will come at the US Open from the end of August. At 35, and with a history of physical problems on the grass, the Spaniard needs some time to clear his mind after a hectic clay-court season., Some golf and some fishing usually does the trick, before Nadal turns his attention to training for August's North American hard-court swing.

Key items of PPE came 'close' to running out,"Global demand for PPE surged in 2020, causing prices to double Central stocks of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) came within eight hours of running out in April 2020, a report has found. Audit Scotland said a stockpile of key items such as long-sleeved gowns had run ""very low"" early in the pandemic. Its report examines how the Scottish government and NHS Scotland managed PPE arrangements. The Scottish government welcomed the report and said Scotland had never run out of PPE. But the BMA's Scottish Consultants Committee said it added to the ""clear evidence"" that Scotland was ""not effectively prepared"" to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak last year. The committee's chairman, Dr Graeme Eunson, said: ""It is very concerning to see how short supplies actually were in April last year, and that reflects the real issues and worries we were raising at the time on behalf of our members - and indeed all health and care staff across Scotland who were working throughout the pandemic. ""Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge the considerable, and rapid work that went into improving the situation and getting PPE to those frontline workers."" Audit Scotland also found the surge in prices for PPE cost NHS National Services Scotland (NHS NSS) Â£37.4m over what it would have normally paid for the safety equipment. A similar study carried out at a UK level by the National Audit Office estimated the UK spent Â£10bn extra in inflated prices for PPE due to an ""inadequate"" stockpile and the surge in global demand early in the pandemic. Ministers not fully ready for Covid, says watchdog NHS issues one billion PPE items during pandemic The Audit Scotland report reiterated its earlier finding that the Scottish government did not fully implement recommendations from pandemic preparedness exercises. It also said the government could have done more to ensure access to PPE and training in its use. As global demand surged and overseas factories closed, PPE prices doubled in early 2020. The report said: ""Had NHS NSS been able to buy PPE at the same prices as 2019, it would have spent Â£37.4m less on PPE stock in the first five months of the pandemic."" Centrally-held stocks of certain key items were ""very low"" in April 2020, with just eight hours' worth of long-sleeved gowns stored by NHS NSS. However, individual health boards may have had additional supplies of PPE items, the report noted.  Â£37.4min increased spending as prices doubled 1.1bnitems of PPE issued in 12 months Â£340mof PPE contracts awarded The report went on to say that 78 contracts worth Â£340m were awarded to companies providing PPE between March 2020 and June 2021. A total of 29 of these contracts, worth Â£98m, were awarded to new suppliers with no competition. NHS NSS distributed 1.1 billion items of PPE between March 2020 and April 2021. The report recommended taking a longer-term approach to procuring PPE, including planning for future pandemics. It noted NHS NSS was already developing a new stock management system and renting warehouses for PPE. Stephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, said: ""The Scottish government and NHS National Services Scotland worked well together under extremely challenging circumstances to set up new arrangements for the supply and distribution of PPE to health and social care settings. ""The challenge now will be in developing a longer-term approach to PPE supply and distribution that includes both business as usual needs as well as preparing for future pandemics."" NHS NSS is responsible for holding and distributing central stocks of PPE In March this year, MSPs on a Holyrood committee urged the auditor general to publish the PPE spending report faster, saying the UK National Audit Office had produced its findings in November 2020. Scottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said: ""This Audit Scotland report once again exposes the reality of PPE shortages in Scotland at the height of the pandemic. ""Despite the SNP's spin that PPE supplies never ran out, this report makes clear that at critical moments, less than a day of some key supplies were available. ""As frontline staff have made clear, the reality is that our NHS was just hours away from disaster because of PPE shortages."" Mary Morgan, chief executive of NHS NSS, said the report recognised the ""crucial role"" played by NSS in ensuring Scotland never ran out of critical PPE during the pandemic. ""Our national procurement teams worked 24/7 to overcome unprecedented global demand and the collapse of international supply chains,"" she said. ""They worked with partners to develop new supply routes to support our social care colleagues, and made direct deliveries to ensure primary care teams received their essential supplies. ""The decisions taken in spring of 2020 had to be made urgently to reduce the risk of our NHS being overwhelmed."" Ms Morgan added that lessons learned during the pandemic had already been implemented. A Scottish government spokesperson said Covid-19 had brought ""unprecedented global demand"" for PPE. ""In the first phase of the pandemic, there were collapses in the international PPE supply chain, combined with greatly increased levels of demand for PPE in Scotland and around the world. ""Scotland never ran out of PPE. Work undertaken by the Scottish government and its partner organisations at that time included setting up a whole new Scottish supply chain from scratch, with the creation of hundreds of jobs. ""The Scottish government agrees with Audit Scotland that we need to learn from this pandemic and bring that learning into planning for future pandemics - and that work is already under way.""

NHS issues one billion PPE items during pandemic,"More than one billion items of PPE have been issued by Scotland's health service since the start of the pandemic, new figures show. The protective equipment has been used by the NHS and social care sector in the fight against Covid. The increased use of masks, gloves, gowns and hand sanitiser has cost the taxpayer more than Â£320m. A further Â£7m in new contracts to deal with the extra waste generated has also been awarded by the NHS. The latestNHS Scotland figures,externalshow that between 1 March, 2020 and 5 May this year, more than 1.07 billion items of PPE had been issued to the NHS and care homes. This includes nearly 200 million masks and more than 320 million pairs of gloves.  664.8mGloves (singles) 190.9mType IIR masks 187.1mAprons An analysis done for Audit Scotland shows that, as of early February 2020, the NHS in Scotland was distributing 96,911 items of PPE every week. Equivalent to five million a week. By the first week of April this haul of protective equipment had reached 24.4m - 200 times the usual amount. Unprecedented worldwide demand for PPE saw prices soar and, as of December 2020, the additional cost of the equipment was put at Â£320m by health boards and the social care sector. Pandemic 'causing new wave' of plastic pollution Face masks and PPE found on a quarter of beaches Waste collection costs hit Â£15m after HES collapse As well as the PPE, waste collection costs have gone up as a result of the pandemic. The NHS has awarded extra contracts worth more than Â£7m to collect used PPE and waste generated by the vaccination and testing programme. This is in addition to theScotland-wide Â£100m NHS waste contractrun by Spanish-owned Tradebe Healthcare. NHS figures show that in April this year the health service dealt with 1,633 tonnes of waste, up more than 200 tonnes on the same month in 2020. A spokeswoman for NHS National Services Scotland said: ""The NHS Scotland response to Covid-19 witnessed a sudden increase in both the overall volume of healthcare waste and the type of healthcare waste produced right across the UK. ""All NHS healthcare waste producers were impacted, as well as healthcare waste service providers. ""During 2020, Covid-19 planning anticipated further waves.

Alcohol sales drop to lowest level in 26 years,"A minimum price for alcohol was implemented in May 2018 The amount of alcohol sold per person in Scotland last year fell to its the lowest level for 26 years. Public Health Scotland figures show 9.4 litres of pure alcohol were sold per adult in 2020, the equivalent of each adult in the country drinking 18 units a week. It is the third year in a row that the level has fallen and the largest drop on record. However, the figure was still higher than in England and Wales. The amount of pure alcohol sold per person north of the border was 6% higher, although this was the smallest difference between the nations recorded since 1994. The report, which monitored the impact of alcohol policy, found almost a quarter (24%) of all adults reported exceeding the safe weekly drinking guideline of 14 units a week in 2019. But this was down from just over a third (34%) in 2003. The report also revealed that 1,020 deaths were described as being ""wholly attributable to alcohol"" in 2019 - an average of 20 people per week. Over the course of 2019-20, a total of 23,685 people were admitted to hospital with an alcohol-related diagnosis, with some requiring more than one stay in hospital. Fall in alcohol consumption in Scotland 'stalls' after minimum pricing Alcohol off-sales drop credited to minimum unit pricing Deprivation was linked to drinking-related illness, with the rates for both alcohol-related hospital stays and deaths eight times higher in the most deprived parts of Scotland compared to the least deprived areas. A total of 42.5 million litres of pure alcohol were sold in Scotland in 2020, the report revealed - with sprits and wine accounting for 31% of sales each, beer accounting for 27% and cider 6%. With the coronavirus pandemic forcing bars and restaurants to either close or operate under restrictions for much of last year, 90% of alcohol was bought in supermarkets and other stores, up from 73% in 2019. A quarter of people still drink more than the recommended low-risk weekly guideline Dr Elizabeth Richardson, public health intelligence adviser at Public Health Scotland, said the pandemic was probably a factor in the figures. ""We have previously shown that per-adult sales were lower overall between March and July last year, during the first national lockdown, and it's likely that the pandemic and associated restrictions have contributed to the lower alcohol consumption we see across the Scottish population in 2020,"" she said. ""Despite these trends, the most recent survey data show that nearly a quarter of people still drink more than the recommended low-risk weekly guideline. Among people exceeding the guideline, it is those in the lowest income group who are likely to consume the most."" She added: ""An average of 20 people per week die as a result of their alcohol consumption, and whilst this latest figure represents the lowest rate since 2012, again it is those in the most deprived areas that are more likely to be hospitalised or die because of an alcohol-related harm. Like all harm caused by alcohol, this is preventable."" Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said ""We're really pleased to see that as a nation we are drinking less for the third year running and that alcohol consumption is at a 25-year low - this is a good indication that minimum unit pricing is having the intended effect. ""Although the restrictions on pubs and restaurants for much of 2020 will have affected consumption across the UK, it is notable that the reduction in alcohol purchases in Scotland is greater than in England and Wales. ""But given nearly a quarter of Scots are still regularly drinking over the chief medical officers' low-risk drinking guidelines, we can't afford to take our eye off the ball where preventing alcohol harm is concerned."" She called on the Scottish government to raise the minimum price for alcohol from the current level of 50p a unit to 65p, saying this will ""increase the positive benefits of the policy by reducing consumption, saving more lives and preventing a new generation from developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol"". Scotland's Minister for Public Health, Maree Todd said she was more convinced than ever that minimum unit pricing was one of the main drivers in reducing the harm caused by over consumption of alcohol. She said: ""Clearly Covid-19 and the associated restrictions have had a dramatic impact on the hospitality trade, but these figures demonstrate that the restrictions in place did not simply translate into an increase in the total amount of alcohol being consumed. In fact, the opposite is the case. ""We have already seen that alcohol sales were falling since the introduction of our world-leading Minimum Unit Pricing policy in 2018. ""We know that it will take longer for the full impact of reduced consumption to feed through into health-related statistics, but I am more convinced than ever that MUP is one of the main drivers in reducing alcohol harms.""

First and deputy first minister nominees confirmed,"Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as first and deputy first ministers during a special meeting of the assembly on Thursday Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt. It comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not. The assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs. A meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. Those attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir. Leader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting. This video can not be played 'We will make this a better place for everyone' - Paul Givan Sammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was ""very, very clear"". ""What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,"" said the East Antrim MP. LIVE: Reaction as DUP row deepens after FM nomination Asked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should ""bring people along with them"" and that could not be achieved by ""ignoring the views of a huge number of people"". DUP leader Edwin Poots arrives at DUP headquarters ahead of a meeting of party officers on Thursday ""A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,"" he said. Asked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: ""Wait and see."" ""I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,"" he added. DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson says the first minister nomination should not have taken place on Thursday The first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night dealafter talks involving Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewisended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. But DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them ""to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn FÃ©in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister"". Signatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. Some DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands. Mr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was ""very clear"". ""It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme. Just over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way. There is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. It would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. If there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. It will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. That has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. While a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.

Officially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. Accepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader ""who had a big heart for the people around him"". Ms O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy. When Arlene Fosterstood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. They then had seven days to nominate replacements. Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Mr Poots had named Mr Givanas its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn FÃ©in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in theNew Decade, New Approach,externaldeal that restored power sharing in January 2020. The party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. Mr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. When a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly. ""However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,"" he said. ""If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021."" Brandon Lewis says Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step-in and legislate on Irish language commitments Mr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. ""Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,"" he said. ""Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive."" Mr Poots said his party had not been ""shirking away"" from NDNA, and said there was ""a lot in the cultural package for unionism"". He said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented. ""If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. ""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

Boatman saves baby floating in Ganges river,"The 21-day-old baby girl has been taken to hospital A boatman in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state is being praised after he rescued a baby girl found floating in a wooden box in the Ganges river. Gullu Chaudhary said he was alerted by the cries of the 21-day-old and found her wrapped in a red scarf in the box decorated with images of Hindu deities. The baby has been taken to hospital and her health is being monitored. She will be sent to a shelter home later. Officials are investigating how the baby ended up in the river. They have not speculated on possible motives for the abandonment, but India's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities. Although most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed or abandoned after birth are not uncommon either. The infant was found in a wooden box decorated with images of Hindu deities Police said the box had a birth horoscope card which had the time and date of the baby's birth, and mentioned her name as Ganga - the Hindi name for river Ganges. The state government said it would bear the costs of the baby's nurturing. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the boatman would be rewarded with government benefits, including a house, for showing a ""matchless example of humanity"". Officials in Ghazipur district, where the baby was rescued, told reporters that District Magistrate MP Singh had checked on the baby and that officials were also sent to meet the boatman. Mr Chaudhary told local reporters that when people on the river bank heard the baby girl's cries, no one stepped forward to help. ""But I rushed to rescue her. When I opened the wooden box, I found her."" India newborn girl found in shallow grave 'fighting for life' Where are India's millions of missing girls? The incident created a stir as a crowd gathered on the banks of the river. Videos shot at the scene showed the boatman picking up the box from the water and cradling the newborn in his arms. He then took the baby to his house from where police picked her up and the child welfare officials took her to hospital.

"Poorer pupils miss out in funds change, say unions","A ""worrying"" number of poorer school pupils will miss out on extra funding because of a change in the way support is allocated, unions say. New figures show more than one in five children in England are now eligible for free school meals - an increase of 420,000 children since March 2020. But extra funding for schools will be based on data from last October rather than the latest figures for January. The government says the date change will help with budget planning. The issue of child poverty during the pandemic has been highlighted by Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford,who successfully campaigned for the government to allow about 1.3 million children in England to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays. The January figures show 20.8% of pupils in England now qualify for free school meals, up from 17.3% in January 2020. It means a total of 1.74 million children are eligible for the support. Children are entitled to free school meals if a parent or carer receives one of a number of benefits. Schools set to lose Â£118m funding for poor pupils School poverty cash at risk in date switch Treble poor pupil cash to stem Covid learning gulf Pupil premium funding for schools is based partly on the number of children who are currently, or have been in the last six years, eligible for free school meals. It is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra Â£1,345 per pupil in primary and Â£955 per pupil in secondary settings. In every previous year this has been based on a snapshot of data taken in January each year, but for the first time the figures from the autumn census of schools carried out in October are being used. Schools argue this means their funding for the most disadvantaged children is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty during the pandemic. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""As we expected, there has been a big rise in the number of children eligible for pupil premium this year - and a worrying number of them will not be receiving any additional funding due to a change in reporting date implemented by the government."" He accused the government of ""abandoning those children most in need"" in the middle of a pandemic. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it had ""short-changed schools"". He said the number of pupils eligible for free school meals increased by 100,000 between October 2020 and January this year, suggesting ""a very large funding hole"". ""Whatever the motivation for this change in the rules the result is nothing short of shameful,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said pupil premium funding was expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year and a typical school would see its allocations increase compared with last year. ""Any pupil who becomes eligible after the October census will attract funding in the following year,"" the spokesperson added. The department says using data from October will allow schools to know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead. Wayne Norrie is chief executive officer of Greenwood Academies Trust, which runs a large family of 37 schools in the East Midlands and East of England. The majority of its children come from economically disadvantaged families, with almost 50% eligible for free school meals. He says that over the past three years he has noticed ""the children getting poorer in front of our eyes"", with families more dependent on the school for help with food. Mr Norrie says he is increasingly worried about the impact the pandemic has had on his pupils' language and basic skills. ""We have some older children who are seven years old in our multi-academy trust who staff are working with to re-toilet train because they have lost the ability through lockdown to use a toilet properly,"" he says. He adds that pupils' stamina and concentration levels have also been impacted by not being in school. Based on its calculations, Mr Norrie says he is Â£400,000 down in his budget this year due to the time lag in receiving the pupil premium money for poorer children. Pupil premium funding is not just there for pupil attainment but is used for ""the well-being of our children, the mental health of our children, the stability,"" he says. ""Looking at their basic needs, that make them happy, fed and warm."" Schools in the Greenwood Academies Trust have lost out on Â£400,000 this year, Wayne Norrie says Tracy Mayes, who has a child who receives free school meals at Studfall Junior Academy in Corby, Northamptonshire, also gets extra support from the school through food parcels delivered to her home. She said the parcels made ""a big difference"". ""Once you've paid all your bills there's really not a lot left to last the whole month for food shopping,"" she said. ""A couple of weeks in and you're struggling and wondering where the next meal is going to come from and making what you've got stretch."" The highest rates of children eligible for free school meals are in north-east England, where 27.5% qualify, and the West Midlands, where the figure is 24.5%. These areas also saw the largest increase from 2020. By contrast, 16% of pupils are eligible in south-east England, although all regions saw some increase from 2020.

Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca,"The bosses of Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport have criticised the government for not putting the Balearic Islands, including Majorca, on the green travel list. The boss of Jet2 said he was ""bewildered"" over why they couldn't fly to those destinations. While UK travel is limited, Germans are flocking to popular holiday spots. The government said it would continue to explore how to open international travel safely. Currently very few countries are on the government's green list, which means they are approved for leisure travel, requiring less testing and no quarantine on return. ""When you take the UK government's own criteria for deciding where holidaymakers can travel to, and apply it to the Balearics, we are left bewildered as to why we cannot fly there,"" said Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays' chief executive Steve Heapy. What's happening with foreign travel? Insurers criticised over extent of Covid cover US eases travel rules for 61 countries, but not UK Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport Group (MAG) said EU countries were taking a more positive approach to resuming international travel. ""Hundreds of thousands of people from places like Germany are travelling freely and safely to low-risk holiday destinations,"" he said. MAG has joined with low cost airline Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over its traffic light system, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency over how countries are classified. The Spanish island of Majorca, a favourite of British tourists for decades, is currently on the amber list; travel there is not advised and quarantine is required on return to the UK. But rates of the virus are lower there than in the UK and in recent weeks, German tourists have started arriving in Majorca in large numbers. German travellers need just a digital pre-registration and either an antigen test or proof of vaccination. Dutch and Belgian tourists are also flying to the Balearics but in fewer numbers than those travelling from Germany. Palma de Majorca Airport confirmed to the BBC that during May, 397,931 tourists arrived from Germany on 3,363 flights. In contrast 5,813 UK tourists arrived on 333 flights from UK airports. Local businesses in the Balearics that usually rely on British tourists and their holiday spending, are feeling their absence for a second summer. Mark Steenson owns Francey O'Connor's, an Irish pub in Ca'n Picafort, a Majorca resort that usually welcomes thousands of British holiday-makers. But with Brits still advised not to travel there, he has begun to gear his trade to those who can. ""I went and got a Borussia Dortmund shirt and had the bar sign redone in German to get the German football fans in,"" said Mr Steenson. ""If it weren't for the Germans, we'd be broke. Ca'n Picafort is rammed with Germans,"" he said. ""It is a joy to see."" Mark Steenson has stocked up on German beer this year But rapid adjustments have had to be made, he says: ""I've gone out and bought German beers and I've started trying to learn some German words so I can chat to them."" The Germany and France game in the Euro 2020 tournament earlier this week was a big pull and for the first time this summer, the terrace at Francey O'Connor's filled up. But while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish. The UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates of the virus, he said. ""The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history."" Epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care. Added to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The EU has not added the UK to its ""white list"" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make their own decisions. That's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely grounded. German tourists are flocking back to Majorca's beaches, says bar owner Mark Steenson But when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership. ""We are closed for businesses, we really are,"" she said. ""Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to the Med. ""What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because everyone else will have picked best rates."" ""As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in government of the complexity of this story."" Earlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling holiday demand. ""We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has been released from those restrictions lifting,"" said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays. ""It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there."" The government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations. Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: ""We don't want to get left behind by countries who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data. ""As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely."" Labour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but they had refused to do so. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: ""When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised for aviation 15 months ago? It's now clearer than ever that this government is actively choosing to turn its back on the industry at a time when thousands of jobs are on the line."" Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2 said the continued exclusion of UK tourists risked inflicting long-term damage on the travel industry. ""Other nationalities are going, German customers are arriving on jumbo jets that are being put into Majorca and hotels are filling up. ""Hotels will give rooms in the future to these other nationalities and British tour operators and customers could be squeezed out. He said he hoped the government would review its decision after reexamining the data on 24 June. ""If that is the case, and Malta, Balearic and Canary Islands continue to have low infection rates, I expect them to be on the list. If they are not - I expect an explanation.

But while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish. The UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates of the virus, he said. ""The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history."" Epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care. Added to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The EU has not added the UK to its ""white list"" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make their own decisions. That's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely grounded. German tourists are flocking back to Majorca's beaches, says bar owner Mark Steenson But when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership. ""We are closed for businesses, we really are,"" she said. ""Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to the Med. ""What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because everyone else will have picked best rates."" ""As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in government of the complexity of this story."" Earlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling holiday demand. ""We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has been released from those restrictions lifting,"" said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays. ""It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there."" The government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations. Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: ""We don't want to get left behind by countries who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data. ""As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely."" Labour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but they had refused to do so. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: ""When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised for aviation 15 months ago? It's now clearer than ever that this government is actively choosing to turn its back on the industry at a time when thousands of jobs are on the line."" Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2 said the continued exclusion of UK tourists risked inflicting long-term damage on the travel industry. ""Other nationalities are going, German customers are arriving on jumbo jets that are being put into Majorca and hotels are filling up. ""Hotels will give rooms in the future to these other nationalities and British tour operators and customers could be squeezed out. He said he hoped the government would review its decision after reexamining the data on 24 June. ""If that is the case, and Malta, Balearic and Canary Islands continue to have low infection rates, I expect them to be on the list. If they are not - I expect an explanation.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion, who won the Wimbledon titles in 2008 and 2010, says he needs to ""recuperate after a long clay-court season"". ""It's never an easy decision but after listening to my body and discussing it with my team I understand that it is the right decision,"" said the Spaniard. ""The goal is to prolong my career and continue to do what makes me happy.""

Nadal: The 'tough love' that shaped a 20-time Grand Slam champion Wimbledon contacts Osaka as it looks to revamp media operation Murray and Williams given Wimbledon wildcards Nadal hinted at the decision after hisdefeat by Serbia's world number oneNovak Djokovic in the French Open semi-finals last week. If defending champion Djokovic wins the title at the All England Club, it will move him level with the record shared by Nadal and Switzerland's Roger Federer of 20 men's major singles titles. Nadal said the shorter turnaround between the French Open and Wimbledon - which starts at the All England Club on 28 June - was a key factor in his decision. This year, there are only two weeks between the French Open finishing on the clay and Wimbledon starting on the grass. Usually, there are three weeks between the two majors. The French Open was pushed back a week by Roland Garros organisers in order to start the tournament with fewer of the country's coronavirus restrictions in place - including allowing fans in to watch. ""The fact that there has only been two weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon didn't make it easier on my body to recuperate after the always demanding clay-court season,"" Nadal said in a Twitter post announcing the news. ""They have been two months of great effort and the decision I take is focused looking at the mid and long term.""

""Sport prevention of any kind of excess in my body is a very important factor at this stage of my career in order to try to keep fighting for the highest level of competition and titles,"" Nadal added. The decision also means he will miss the delayed Olympics, which start in Tokyo on 23 July. Nadal has won two Olympic gold medals - in the singles atBeijing 2008,externaland the doubles at Rio 2016. ""The Olympic Games always meant a lot and they were always a priority as a sportsperson, I found the spirit that every sportsperson in the world wants to live,"" Nadal said.

BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Nadal hinted at this very outcome after losing a brutal four-hour French Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic in Paris last Friday. A two-week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon could lead to quite an unpredictable fortnight on the grass, as players have less time than usual to recover physically and to make the transition from clay.

"Poorer pupils miss out in funds change, say unionsSchools say funding is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty.","A ""worrying"" number of poorer school pupils will miss out on extra funding because of a change in the way support is allocated, unions say. New figures show more than one in five children in England are now eligible for free school meals - an increase of 420,000 children since March 2020. But extra funding for schools will be based on data from last October rather than the latest figures for January. The government says the date change will help with budget planning. The issue of child poverty during the pandemic has been highlighted by Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford,who successfully campaigned for the government to allow about 1.3 million children in England to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays. The January figures show 20.8% of pupils in England now qualify for free school meals, up from 17.3% in January 2020. It means a total of 1.74 million children are eligible for the support. Children are entitled to free school meals if a parent or carer receives one of a number of benefits. Schools set to lose Â£118m funding for poor pupils School poverty cash at risk in date switch Treble poor pupil cash to stem Covid learning gulf Pupil premium funding for schools is based partly on the number of children who are currently, or have been in the last six years, eligible for free school meals. It is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra Â£1,345 per pupil in primary and Â£955 per pupil in secondary settings. In every previous year this has been based on a snapshot of data taken in January each year, but for the first time the figures from the autumn census of schools carried out in October are being used. Schools argue this means their funding for the most disadvantaged children is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty during the pandemic. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""As we expected, there has been a big rise in the number of children eligible for pupil premium this year - and a worrying number of them will not be receiving any additional funding due to a change in reporting date implemented by the government."" He accused the government of ""abandoning those children most in need"" in the middle of a pandemic. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it had ""short-changed schools"". He said the number of pupils eligible for free school meals increased by 100,000 between October 2020 and January this year, suggesting ""a very large funding hole"". ""Whatever the motivation for this change in the rules the result is nothing short of shameful,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said pupil premium funding was expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year and a typical school would see its allocations increase compared with last year. ""Any pupil who becomes eligible after the October census will attract funding in the following year,"" the spokesperson added. The department says using data from October will allow schools to know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead. Wayne Norrie is chief executive officer of Greenwood Academies Trust, which runs a large family of 37 schools in the East Midlands and East of England. The majority of its children come from economically disadvantaged families, with almost 50% eligible for free school meals. He says that over the past three years he has noticed ""the children getting poorer in front of our eyes"", with families more dependent on the school for help with food. Mr Norrie says he is increasingly worried about the impact the pandemic has had on his pupils' language and basic skills. ""We have some older children who are seven years old in our multi-academy trust who staff are working with to re-toilet train because they have lost the ability through lockdown to use a toilet properly,"" he says. He adds that pupils' stamina and concentration levels have also been impacted by not being in school. Based on its calculations, Mr Norrie says he is Â£400,000 down in his budget this year due to the time lag in receiving the pupil premium money for poorer children. Pupil premium funding is not just there for pupil attainment but is used for ""the well-being of our children, the mental health of our children, the stability,"" he says. ""Looking at their basic needs, that make them happy, fed and warm."" Schools in the Greenwood Academies Trust have lost out on Â£400,000 this year, Wayne Norrie says Tracy Mayes, who has a child who receives free school meals at Studfall Junior Academy in Corby, Northamptonshire, also gets extra support from the school through food parcels delivered to her home. She said the parcels made ""a big difference"". ""Once you've paid all your bills there's really not a lot left to last the whole month for food shopping,"" she said. ""A couple of weeks in and you're struggling and wondering where the next meal is going to come from and making what you've got stretch."" The highest rates of children eligible for free school meals are in north-east England, where 27.5% qualify, and the West Midlands, where the figure is 24.5%. These areas also saw the largest increase from 2020. By contrast, 16% of pupils are eligible in south-east England, although all regions saw some increase from 2020.

DUP big-hitters concerned about Stormont deal,"Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as first and deputy first ministers during a special meeting of the assembly on Thursday Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill have been confirmed as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers amid an internal Democratic Unionist Party revolt. It comes after a deal was done ending a stalemate over Irish language laws, with the UK government to legislate if Stormont does not. The assembly nominations took place amid opposition from DUP MLAs and MPs. A meeting of party officers took place at the DUP headquarters. Those attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir. Leader Edwin Poots left the meeting in east Belfast shortly after 20:00 BST, but declined to answer questions from the media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting. This video can not be played 'We will make this a better place for everyone' - Paul Givan Sammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was ""very, very clear"". ""What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,"" said the East Antrim MP. LIVE: Reaction as DUP row deepens after FM nomination Asked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should ""bring people along with them"" and that could not be achieved by ""ignoring the views of a huge number of people"". DUP leader Edwin Poots arrives at DUP headquarters ahead of a meeting of party officers on Thursday ""A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,"" he said. Asked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: ""Wait and see."" ""I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,"" he added. DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson says the first minister nomination should not have taken place on Thursday The first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night dealafter talks involving Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewisended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. But DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them ""to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn FÃ©in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister"". Signatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. Some DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands. Mr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was ""very clear"". ""It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme. Just over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way. There is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. It would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. If there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. It will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. That has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. While a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.

Officially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. Accepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader ""who had a big heart for the people around him"". Ms O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy. When Arlene Fosterstood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. They then had seven days to nominate replacements. Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Mr Poots had named Mr Givanas its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn FÃ©in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in theNew Decade, New Approach,externaldeal that restored power sharing in January 2020. The party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. Mr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. When a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly. ""However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,"" he said. ""If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021."" Brandon Lewis says Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step-in and legislate on Irish language commitments Mr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. ""Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,"" he said. ""Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive."" Mr Poots said his party had not been ""shirking away"" from NDNA, and said there was ""a lot in the cultural package for unionism"". He said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented. ""If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. ""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

First crew blasts off to new China space station,"This video can not be played WATCH: The moment the Chinese crew docked with their new space station China has launched three astronauts into orbit to begin occupation of the country's new space station. The three men - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo - are to spend three months aboard the Tianhe module some 380km (236 miles) above the Earth. It will be China's longest crewed space mission to date and the first in nearly five years. The crew successfully docked with the space station just over seven hours after the launch. The moment of contact was met with applause from mission control in China. Their Shenzhou-12 capsule took off atop its Long March 2F rocket on Thursday. Lift-off from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre in the Gobi desert was at 09:22 Beijing time (01:22 GMT). The launch and subsequent mission are another demonstration of China's growing confidence and capability in the space domain. In the past six months, the country has returned rock and soil samples to Earth from the surface of the Moon, and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars - both highly complex and challenging endeavours. China's Zhurong Mars rover takes a selfie China launches first module of new space station China's Chang'e-5 mission returns Moon samples The primary objective for Commander Nie Haisheng and his team on the Shenzhou-12 mission is to bring the 22.5-tonne Tianhe module into service. ""I have a lot of expectations,"" Mr Nie said ahead of the launch. ""We need to set up our new home in space and test a series of new technologies. So, the mission is tough and challenging. I believe with the three of us working closely together, doing thorough and accurate operations, we can overcome our challenges. We have the confidence to complete the mission."" The Shenzhou-12 capsule successfully took off atop its Long March 2F rocket This 16.6m-long, 4.2m-wide Tianhe cylinder was launched in April. It is the first and core component in what will eventually be a near 70-tonne orbiting outpost, comprising living quarters, science labs and even a Hubble-class telescope to view the cosmos. The various elements will be launched in turn over the course of the next couple of years. The construction will be accompanied by regular cargo deliveries, as well as crew expeditions. The Chinese authorities kept the identities of the Shenzhou-12 astronauts under wraps until a press conference on Wednesday. A fighter pilot, Nie Haisheng, 56, is said to be China's oldest astronaut in space. He is a veteran of two previous flights, which included a 15-day visit in 2013 to the prototype space station, Tiangong-1. This has since been de-orbited. His crewmates, Liu Boming (54) and Tang Hongbo (45), are also from an air force background. Liu's earlier spaceflight experience was on the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008 that saw him participate in China's first ever spacewalk. Tang Hongbo (L), Nie Haisheng (C) and Liu Boming (R) spoke to reporters on Wednesday from behind glass - a pre-flight quarantine measure Mr Tang is the rookie on this occasion, having never before gone into orbit. The food, fuel and equipment the trio will need during their stay aboard Tianhe was delivered by a robotic freighter last month. This freighter is still attached, and the men will make unpacking its supplies their first task as soon as they've settled in. Included in the delivery are two spacesuits they'll need to conduct spacewalks on the exterior of Tianhe. China has in recent years made no secret of its space ambitions. It has poured significant funding into its space efforts, and in 2019 became the first country to send an un-crewed rover to the far side of the Moon. But it's had to go at it alone in developing a space station, in part because it has been excluded from the International Space Station project. The US, which leads that partnership with Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan, will not co-operate with the Asian nation in orbit. For its part, China says it is open to foreign involvement on its station. In the first instance, this means hosted scientific experiments. For example, the Shenzhou-12 crew will conduct cancer investigations that are led from Norway. And on the outside of the station, there is an Indian-developed telescopic spectrograph to study ultraviolet emissions coming from deep space, from the likes of exploded stars. But, long term, there probably also will be visits to the station by non-Chinese nationals. Russia, which has shared technology in the past with China, has mentioned the possibility of sending its cosmonauts. At Wednesday's press conference to introduce the Shenzhou-12 crew, Ji Qiming, an assistant director with China's human spaceflight agency, said: ""We welcome co-operation in this regard in general. ""It is believed that, in the near future, after the completion of the Chinese space station, we will see Chinese and foreign astronauts fly and work together,"" he added. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the country's space endeavours and the Chinese state media regularly cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"".

"Poorer pupils miss out in funds change, say unionsSchools say funding is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty.Family & Education","A ""worrying"" number of poorer school pupils will miss out on extra funding because of a change in the way support is allocated, unions say. New figures show more than one in five children in England are now eligible for free school meals - an increase of 420,000 children since March 2020. But extra funding for schools will be based on data from last October rather than the latest figures for January. The government says the date change will help with budget planning. The issue of child poverty during the pandemic has been highlighted by Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford,who successfully campaigned for the government to allow about 1.3 million children in England to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays. The January figures show 20.8% of pupils in England now qualify for free school meals, up from 17.3% in January 2020. It means a total of 1.74 million children are eligible for the support. Children are entitled to free school meals if a parent or carer receives one of a number of benefits. Schools set to lose Â£118m funding for poor pupils School poverty cash at risk in date switch Treble poor pupil cash to stem Covid learning gulf Pupil premium funding for schools is based partly on the number of children who are currently, or have been in the last six years, eligible for free school meals. It is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra Â£1,345 per pupil in primary and Â£955 per pupil in secondary settings. In every previous year this has been based on a snapshot of data taken in January each year, but for the first time the figures from the autumn census of schools carried out in October are being used. Schools argue this means their funding for the most disadvantaged children is not keeping up with the number of families falling into financial difficulty during the pandemic. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""As we expected, there has been a big rise in the number of children eligible for pupil premium this year - and a worrying number of them will not be receiving any additional funding due to a change in reporting date implemented by the government."" He accused the government of ""abandoning those children most in need"" in the middle of a pandemic. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it had ""short-changed schools"". He said the number of pupils eligible for free school meals increased by 100,000 between October 2020 and January this year, suggesting ""a very large funding hole"". ""Whatever the motivation for this change in the rules the result is nothing short of shameful,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said pupil premium funding was expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year and a typical school would see its allocations increase compared with last year. ""Any pupil who becomes eligible after the October census will attract funding in the following year,"" the spokesperson added. The department says using data from October will allow schools to know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead. Wayne Norrie is chief executive officer of Greenwood Academies Trust, which runs a large family of 37 schools in the East Midlands and East of England. The majority of its children come from economically disadvantaged families, with almost 50% eligible for free school meals. He says that over the past three years he has noticed ""the children getting poorer in front of our eyes"", with families more dependent on the school for help with food. Mr Norrie says he is increasingly worried about the impact the pandemic has had on his pupils' language and basic skills. ""We have some older children who are seven years old in our multi-academy trust who staff are working with to re-toilet train because they have lost the ability through lockdown to use a toilet properly,"" he says. He adds that pupils' stamina and concentration levels have also been impacted by not being in school. Based on its calculations, Mr Norrie says he is Â£400,000 down in his budget this year due to the time lag in receiving the pupil premium money for poorer children. Pupil premium funding is not just there for pupil attainment but is used for ""the well-being of our children, the mental health of our children, the stability,"" he says. ""Looking at their basic needs, that make them happy, fed and warm."" Schools in the Greenwood Academies Trust have lost out on Â£400,000 this year, Wayne Norrie says Tracy Mayes, who has a child who receives free school meals at Studfall Junior Academy in Corby, Northamptonshire, also gets extra support from the school through food parcels delivered to her home. She said the parcels made ""a big difference"". ""Once you've paid all your bills there's really not a lot left to last the whole month for food shopping,"" she said. ""A couple of weeks in and you're struggling and wondering where the next meal is going to come from and making what you've got stretch."" The highest rates of children eligible for free school meals are in north-east England, where 27.5% qualify, and the West Midlands, where the figure is 24.5%. These areas also saw the largest increase from 2020. By contrast, 16% of pupils are eligible in south-east England, although all regions saw some increase from 2020.

Kim Jong-un admits North Korea food concernsHe told the ruling party that the coronavirus pandemic and a series of storms had led to bad harvests.Asia,"Kim Jong-un's slimmer frame has prompted more speculation about his health North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has formally acknowledged that his country is facing food shortages. Addressing a meeting of senior leaders, Mr Kim said: ""The people's food situation is now getting tense"". He said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding. There are reports that food prices have spiked, with NK News reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (Â£32). North Korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trade with China has plummeted as a result. North Korea relies on China for food, fertiliser and fuel. Kim Jong-un wages war on slang, jeans and films N Korea's Kim warns of crisis amid famine threat N Korea to skip Tokyo Olympics over Covid fears North Korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes. The authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling Workers' Party central committee which started this week in the capital Pyongyang. During the meeting, Mr Kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year. Officials were expected to discuss relations with the US and South Korea during the event but no details have been released yet. In April, Mr Kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million. It is highly unusual for Kim Jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage. But this is a North Korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed. The problem for Mr Kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future. He said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity. This has not happened. Now he's having to prime the population for more hard work. He is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting ""worse and worse"". With so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere - not just in sealed off North Korea. He also described efforts to beat Covid-19 as a ""protracted war"". That signals that border closures are not easing any time soon. That is the concern of many aid organisations. The sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through. Most NGOs have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out. Pyongyang has always called for ""self-reliance"". It has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help. If it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price.

No major lockdown easing in Wales until July,"As cases rise, sources say there will not be big changes in the rules for the next four weeks Covid restrictions in Wales are unlikely to be significantly relaxed until July because of concern about the Delta variant, BBC Wales has been told. Welsh government sources are downplaying expectations ahead of a scheduled announcement by First Minister Mark Drakeford on Friday. Ministers have been looking at permitting more people to meet indoors. But, as cases rise, sources say there will not be big changes in the rules for the next four weeks. Cabinet ministers met on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the latest scientific evidence. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Wedding bells? The Covid do's and dont's Restrictions on outdoor gatherings were eased earlier in June as part of a phased introduction of Alert Level One - the lowest level on the Welsh government's coronavirus control plan. Ministers have been reviewing the situation before deciding whether other restrictions could be relaxed on 21 June. Potential rule changes included allowing any six people to meet inside private homes, allowing more people to attend indoor events and re-opening ice skating rinks. Earlier this week Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said original plans to scrap Covid lockdown rules in England on 21 June werenever considered sensibleby the Welsh government. He said it had not been right to set out such a commitment when the pandemic caused ""unpleasant surprises"". Boris Johnson has confirmed the final stage of lockdown easing in England will be delayed until 19 July. Can I go on holiday abroad from Wales? Headaches and runny nose linked to Delta variant Wales' infection rate has risen from under 10 to 22 infections per 100,000 people since the start of the month as cases have risen. Wales has reported 100 new positive tests a day on average in the past seven days, an upturn which might be expected as things continue to open up, with clusters in local areas driving the overall increase. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? Mr Drakeford will announce the next steps in a press conference on Friday, but sources say only ""minor"" changes are likely. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This does not come as a surprise, particularly in light of the concerns over the Delta variant."" He said the Welsh government should consider easing some of the restrictions on weddings and funerals and ongoing restrictions would mean businesses would  require more financial support. Plaid Cymru called on the Welsh government to ""provide leadership and support"" for the hospitality sector, where it said many had ""genuine fears for the future"". Deputy leader and health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth also said ""caution must be taken"". ""Set against a backdrop of the Delta variant, and talk of further lockdowns, this is giving genuine worry for a whole industry,"" he said.

Halfords bike supplies hit amid Covid disruption,"Halfords has warned it faces ""acute"" challenges with bike supplies after Covid restrictions led to surging demand and lockdowns in Asia hit manufacturers. Sales of bikes rose by 54.1% in the year to 2 April as the pandemic limited local travel and overseas holidays. Halford said ""pent-up"" demand for bikes and continuing restrictions on foreign trips would support future sales. However, it added: ""Supply challenges for cycling products remain acute."" As well as strong demand for conventional bikes, Halfords said it had seen a 94% rise in demand for e-bikes, e-scooters and accessories during its financial year to 2 April. However, global bike supplies have been hampered by shortages of components such as brakes, as well as raw materials. Local lockdowns have also disrupted businesses in Asia which make cycles. E-bike sales boom despite high prices and confusing rules The Bicycle Association said: ""Most bicycles in the world are manufactured in East Asia, and even those which are assembled in the EU often require components shipped from that region. This extended supply chain does mean that, even in normal circumstances, delivery times are long. ""Sudden increases in global demand put additional pressure on production and, particularly recently, there have been constraints on shipping. This has resulted in some temporary delays in supply."" Halford announced ""very strong"" full-year results, with total sales up 13.1% to Â£1.2bn. Pre-tax profits rose to Â£64.5m from Â£19.4m for the previous year. Looking ahead, the bike and motoring retailer said: ""A return to normal trading patterns remains highly uncertain, particularly in the second half, as the hospitality industry and international travel potentially reopen to a greater extent."" Nevertheless, Halfords said it has seen ""positive momentum"" continue into the first weeks of its current financial year ""with demand for our motoring services strong, cycling demand remaining elevated, and staycation products"" proving popular. Over the last year, it said sales of products related to people holidaying in the UK and motor maintenance had grown, including services such as car cleaning and body repair. As well as bike shops, garages were also allowed to stay open during periods of Covid lockdown and Halfords said like-for-like revenue from its ""autocentres"" grew by 9.7%. However, due to fewer cars being on the road as people worked from home, like-for-like sales within its retail motoring business fell by 12.1%. It said this was ""against the backdrop of 25% fewer car journeys and low consumer confidence"".

Botswana diamond could be world's third largest,"President Mokgweetsi Masisi was shown the gem at a ceremony in the capital, Gaborone A diamond believed to be the third largest ever found has been put on display in Botswana. The stone - weighing 1,098 carats - was shown to President Mokgweetsi Masisi, two weeks after the diamond firm, Debswana, unearthed it. The huge gem is only slightly less heavy than the world's second-largest diamond which was also found in Botswana in 2015. Botswana is Africa's largest producer of diamonds. ""This is the largest diamond to be recovered by Debswana in its history of over 50 years in operation,"" said Lynette Armstrong, Debswana Diamond Company's acting managing director. ""From our preliminary analysis it could be the world's third largest gem quality stone."" Debswana is a joint venture between the government and global diamond giant De Beers and up to 80% of the income from sales goes to state coffers through dividends, royalties and taxes. An estimate of the stone's potential cost has not yet been released but in 2017, the second-largest diamond ever found,Lesedi La Rona, was sold for $53m (Â£39.5m). The biggest diamond ever discovered was the 3,106 carat Cullinan diamond found in South Africa in 1905. Debswana says the diamond is 73mm long, 52mm wide and 27mm thick Botswana's Minerals Minister, Lefoko Moagi, said the latest find could not have come at a better time for Botswana after the pandemic caused diamond sales to slump last year. The newly discovered stone, which was found at the Jwaneng mine, is yet to be named. Ms Armstrong said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to sell the ""rare and extraordinary stone"" though De Beers or through the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company. Treasure seekers converge on a village in South Africa after a man dug up a crystal-like stone in an open field and put out word of the discovery.

Mr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was ""very clear"". ""It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme. Just over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way. There is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. It would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. If there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. It will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. That has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together.

Officially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. Accepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader ""who had a big heart for the people around him"". Ms O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy. When Arlene Fosterstood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. They then had seven days to nominate replacements. Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Mr Poots had named Mr Givanas its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn FÃ©in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in theNew Decade, New Approach,externaldeal that restored power sharing in January 2020. The party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. Mr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. When a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly. ""However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,"" he said. ""If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021."" Brandon Lewis says Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step-in and legislate on Irish language commitments Mr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. ""Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,"" he said. ""Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive."" Mr Poots said his party had not been ""shirking away"" from NDNA, and said there was ""a lot in the cultural package for unionism"". He said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented. ""If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. ""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

"UK aid cuts risk millions of lives, warns WHO","Cuts to the UK's aid budget will leave millions of people at risk of dying from ""neglected tropical diseases"", the World Health Organization has said. Nearly 280 million lifesaving tablets are likely to expire and have to be incinerated due to the withdrawal of UK money, the United Nations agency said. The UK's annual foreign aid budget has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, a cut of almost Â£4bn. Ministers say Â£10bn will be still spent in 2021, with Â£1.3bn on global health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has joined many other agencies in warning about the impact of the Treasury's decision to cut foreign aid this year. In a submission to the International Development Committee,external- which is conducting an inquiry into the future of UK aid - the WHO said the cuts would leave millions of the world's poorest people at risk from so-called ""neglected tropical diseases"". These include elephantiasis, trachoma and Guinea Worm and are among 20 disease groups that mainly affect people in the poorest countries. They are preventable but without treatment the WHO said they ""kill, blind, disfigure and maim"". Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Rebel Tories blocked in bid to reverse aid cuts The WHO said that prior to its aid cuts, the UK provided funding to 19 countries through its ""flagship"" health programme called Accelerating the Sustainable Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (Ascend). Much of the UK's aid helped distribute lifesaving medicines but without that help, the agency said it was likely 277 million tablets would expire and have to be incinerated. ""No obvious alternative source of funding exists to fill the funding gaps that will be left by the exit of Ascend,"" the WHO added. The Foreign Office said it had been forced by financial impact of the pandemic to take tough decisions to leave programmes that treated these diseases. ""The seismic impact of the pandemic forced the tough decision to temporarily reduce the aid budget and exit some programmes, including the Accelerating the Sustainable Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases programme,"" a statement said. ""We will still spend more than Â£10bn this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health, including Â£1.3bn on global health. ""We will focus on the UK's position at the forefront of the international response to Covid-19, and will continue to support programmes in countries affected by neglected tropical diseases."" The Conservative Party committed to spending 0.7% in its manifesto for the 2019 general election - but last year ministers decided to reduce this year's spending, saying it was temporary and hard to justify given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the Covid pandemic. The controversial move has drawn criticism from Tory and opposition MPs - who havetried to overturn the cuts,as well as dozens of charities and the United Nations.

"Care services investigating too many families - reviewChild protection services in England are not providing enough early support, a report says.","Child protection services in England are too focused on investigating families in crisis and do not provide enough early support, a report says. Anindependent review,externalof council-run children's social care said services to protect vulnerable children were in urgent need of investment and reform. It concluded that with an increasing demand for help, the current system was unsustainable and failing young people. The government, which set up the review, said it was boosting funding. Over the last three months, the review team has heard from more than 1,000 young people, families and staff working in children's services. It found a system under significant strain with an increasing number of families being investigated, more children in care and costs spiralling. Postcode lottery for baby care orders - judge Calls to NSPCC helpline at record high in pandemic Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Josh MacAlister, who chaired the independent review, said: ""If we carry on like this, children's social care will both become more expensive and continue to be inadequate in the support it gives to children and families, so we need to change."" The report said deprivation was a key factor among families needing help. Many of those who asked for support found assessments and investigations added to their stress. The number of inquiries into whether a child is at risk of significant harm - known as section 47 inquiries - has more than doubled since 2010, rising to 201,000 investigations in a year. But the report said 135,000 of those led to no child protection plan. It concluded that concerns about risk have dominated. Official figures also show that in 2019-20 there were more than 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England, up 24% in a decade. The review team looked at the availability and costs of foster care places and children's homes. It concluded this ""placement market"" was broken and that too often young people ended up being moved a long way from home. ""Too often children are moved far from where they have grown up, are separated from their brothers or sisters, are forced to move schools, and have a revolving door of social workers,"" the report said. ""We are failing to build lifelong loving relationships around these children."" With council budgets squeezed over the last 10 years, spending has increasingly focused on expensive crisis services that local authorities are legally required to provide. That has meant cuts to early help for families. At High Trees Family Centre in Hertfordshire, the county council provides the sort of wide-ranging support that the review team believes is vital. In one place, all local families can access health and care services along with playgroups. Chelsea, mother of one-year-old Darcie, says council-run playgroups are a place to get advice and tips on parenting Chelsea, whose one-year-old daughter Darcie is happily playing with paints, said there should be more play sessions like this. ""It is very important for the mum and the baby,"" she said. ""It means the mum can meet new friends and get advice and tips."" Sammy Lewis works with pregnant mothers and under-ones at the centre. She said that because the centre was open to everyone, it was easy for parents to ask for help and made a real difference to those who were struggling. ""That can help to prevent the need for additional support later down the line and they can feel more happy and confident about family life,"" she said. The independent review will publish its final report, making recommendations for change, next spring. NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said the review should seize a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to create ""a comprehensive, properly-funded care system that works for every child and family who needs it, regardless of their background or where they live"". Sammy Lewis, who works with pregnant mothers, says giving parents opportunities to ask for help can prevent issues escalating Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said children's social care was ""hamstrung"" by under-investment and bureaucracy, too often intervened only at ""crisis point"", and had ""serious systemic flaws"" including a lack of understanding of threats outside the home. ""Covid has left more children at risk of abuse, exploitation, isolation, mental ill-health and poverty,"" he said, with vulnerable older children being failed as they enter adulthood. The government said it was giving councils an extra Â£16m to target more support earlier in the lives of children already in the care system. It is also planning a pilot scheme to increase educational help. Children and families minister Vicky Ford said: ""For children in care, or those who are known to social care teams, it is absolutely vital we help them to overcome the barriers they can face in education so that they have the best chance to succeed in life."" Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""After failing to ban unregulated accommodation for all children in care, there is no evidence that ministers will deliver the reforms that are needed to stop vulnerable young people fall through the cracks."" Directors who run council care services said that while the child protection system in England was one of the safest in the world, the report represented a once-in-a-generation chance to make meaningful and lasting change for children and young people.

""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.

Kim Jong-un admits to 'tense' food situation,"Kim Jong-un's slimmer frame has prompted more speculation about his health North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has formally acknowledged that his country is facing food shortages. Addressing a meeting of senior leaders, Mr Kim said: ""The people's food situation is now getting tense"". He said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding. There are reports that food prices have spiked, with NK News reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (Â£32). North Korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trade with China has plummeted as a result. North Korea relies on China for food, fertiliser and fuel. Kim Jong-un wages war on slang, jeans and films N Korea's Kim warns of crisis amid famine threat N Korea to skip Tokyo Olympics over Covid fears North Korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes. The authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling Workers' Party central committee which started this week in the capital Pyongyang. During the meeting, Mr Kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year. Officials were expected to discuss relations with the US and South Korea during the event but no details have been released yet. In April, Mr Kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million. It is highly unusual for Kim Jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage. But this is a North Korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed. The problem for Mr Kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future. He said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity. This has not happened. Now he's having to prime the population for more hard work. He is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting ""worse and worse"". With so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere - not just in sealed off North Korea. He also described efforts to beat Covid-19 as a ""protracted war"". That signals that border closures are not easing any time soon. That is the concern of many aid organisations. The sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through. Most NGOs have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out. Pyongyang has always called for ""self-reliance"". It has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help. If it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price.

"Welsh NHS under 'substantial pressure,' says chief","NHS Wales waiting times are due to be published amid a growing backlog of patients The Welsh NHS is under ""substantial pressure"" as services return to pre-pandemic levels, its chief executive has warned. Dr Andrew Goodall said the need to continue with Covid-19 precautions meant a ""difficult combination"" of factors was straining the system. Monthly waiting times show another rise, amid a growing backlog of patients waiting for treatment. One doctors' group has called for a radical reorganisation of services. Data from April showed there were 595,272 people on waiting lists in Wales - this has risen again on March and isup 29% on pre-pandemic levels. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it was a ""massive uphill task"" to clear the backlog and did not rule out establishing regional hubs. ""We've made it very clear it probably will take the whole length of this Senedd term [five years] to get us back to pre pandemic levels,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""We had to pause non-emergency care, that has created a massive challenge for us, but we've already put Â£100m on the table to get our health boards to shift some of that [backlog]."" We can see in April, 223,365 people were waiting more than 36 weeks or nine months for hospital treatment. When we look at specialist areas, in trauma and orthopaedics there were 52,822 people waiting more than nine months. This is a 527% increase on the pre-pandemic total in February 2020. Altogether, there are 87,918orthopaedic and trauma patientswaiting for treatment. Those waiting the longest forgeneral surgeryhave also hit a new high - 26,943, 12 times the numbers waiting before the pandemic. In February 2020, 252 people had been waiting more than nine months forcardiology treatment,and by April this year there were 4,159 people with long waits. The number on that list has risen slightly after falling for four successive months. Numbers waiting the longest forcardiothoracic surgeryare still falling although there are still 136 patients - three times the numbers before the pandemic hit. While two people were waiting more than nine months before the pandemic in February 2020 forrestorative dental work, that has now increased to 625, although has fallen for the fifth successive month Forneurology treatments, numbers rose from 22 to 906 from pre-pandemic to April. Cancer charity Tenovus said 13,480 people in Wales were referred to the Suspected Cancer Pathway April - the second consecutive time the monthly figure has exceeded the pre-pandemic average monthly figure of 13,208. ""This is a chink of light that gives us optimism that, as the Covid-19 pandemic begins to subside, we can avert a cancer pandemic through a combination of public awareness-raising and investment in our health service,"" said chief executive Judi Rhys. Attendances at emergency departments have also returned to pre-pandemic levels, and NHS Wales said that one health board experienced its busiest-ever day for A&E attendances on Monday. In May, there were more than 81,000 A&E attendances, nearly 5,000 more than in February 2020. The NHS Wales chief executive added that planned treatments were now at 70% of normal levels. Dr Goodall said: ""It is a substantial pressure, I think it is substantial for different reasons. NHS staff want to make sure that we are able to support our patients across Wales and make sure that they can be seen within the appropriate and right level of services. ""But they are having to balance a growth in emergency pressures back to normal levels. ""They are still having to protect both staff and patients working around them. And they are the same staff who have been there through the pandemic, who are having to focus on the new services, to make sure people are supported as well."" Dr Andrew Goodall says Covid precautions mean a ""difficult combination"" of factors are straining the system Health boards have been asked to come up with innovative ways of dealing with the backlog, and an initial Â£100m of new funding has been made available by the Welsh government to try to bring waiting lists down. Pilot schemes have begun in some areas to reduce waiting times or improve the quality of life for those who will continue to face the longest delays in their treatment. Surgical teams at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend have already seen a significant reduction in waiting times for patients referred for urgent treatment after visiting A&E or their GP. The Ambulatory Emergency Surgical Unit was launched at the hospital before the pandemic to allow patients to be assessed, diagnosed and treated - often on the same day. They do not need to be seen by separate medical teams or admitted as an inpatient. Covid innovations 'will reshape future NHS' A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' The model was so efficient it has since been expanded to emergency medical admissions, and will be implemented for emergency gynaecology admissions from 1 July. Consultant surgeon Simon Weaver said the system had allowed about 80% of patients to be seen and treated within three hours, compared with about 30% before it was introduced. ""When it comes to resetting services it's really important that we're a getting a bang for our buck,"" he said. ""We've got to take this as an opportunity to restart the NHS."" The Ambulatory Emergency Surgical Unit has slashed treatment times, consultant surgeon Simon Weaver says While local innovations will help reduce some pressures, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has called for the creation of non-Covid hubs to tackle waiting lists. Richard Johnson, the director of RCS in Wales, said: ""There is now an urgency to develop these sites and have a radical rethink of how the NHS is working in Wales. ""We are looking at these sites for planned treatments. We are not talking about new sites, we are talking about a reorganisation of the sites we have in Wales already."" Mr Johnson said an RCS survey found patients were prepared to travel in order to be treated at new hubs across Wales. And he said there needed to be ""an open and honest discussion"" about the implications of not changing the way hospitals are currently organised. Dr Goodall said many changes had been implanted already, including greater use of technology in connecting patients to clinicians. He added it was ""inevitable that we're going to have to have more regional solutions, with health boards working alongside each other to achieve that"". ""And I know there's a lot of clinical support for that to happen in Wales."" The health minister said the Welsh government was currently looking at ways to fund such hubs. Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said there was a ""long road ahead"" for the NHS in Wales to recover from the pandemic. He urged the public to continue using services responsibly, adding: ""It's the same exhausted staff who have worked tirelessly over the last 15 months that will be required to deliver services and ultimately help tackle waiting lists. ""We can't thank them enough for all they've done for the people of Wales, and we must remember that as we begin the next chapter of recovery, they too need to recover."" Cases of the Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, remain comparatively low in Wales compared with England. Dr Goodall said the next two to four weeks would be crucial in determining whether a further increase in cases in Wales would result in a spike in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? He said: ""Numbers associated with a Delta variant remain very low in Wales from a hospital perspective, although they're increasing in terms of community cases. So we're tracking it very carefully. ""But inevitably there will be some impact in Wales and it's why, in part, I know that the first minister and the cabinet made decisions to defer some arrangements earlier on during this month, because it was to try and allow for more vaccination coverage for the population, which will provide a higher level of protection.""

'I fell through the cracks',"About 10,000 young people move out of the care system in the UK every year. For some there's a sudden cut-off with little support on the other side. Kim Emenike describes her experience of what has been described as a ""care cliff"". The summer before Kim Emenike turned 18 her foster carer - who she'd lived with in south London for the best part of a decade - made it clear she wanted Kim out as soon as possible. Kim's mum had died from cancer when Kim was seven. Her dad wasn't in the picture and there weren't any other blood relatives, so as a young child Kim had been placed into care. For the first five years things were ""absolutely amazing,"" she says. But from the age of about 13 the relationship with her foster carer began to break down. ""I don't know if I could ever pinpoint exactly why we weren't getting on - I guess we were just very different,"" she says. Kim was excelling at school, and had become involved in the local youth council and the UK Youth Parliament. But her foster carer showed little interest. ""That created friction between us because these things were very important to me,"" Kim says. ""The situation got really bad, and it was very hard for me mentally and emotionally."" Kim's social worker and school were aware of the problem, but it was decided that she should remain in her foster placement until she had completed her GCSEs. ""So I had to stay there and get through it,"" Kim says. ""In hindsight, I don't think it was the best decision."" Kim had had various social workers over the years, and at 16 was assigned a personal adviser who'd be with her until she was at least 21 and whose job it was to make sure that Kim understood what services and support were available to her as she became independent. ""I had a Pathway Plan which gives you an overview of the coming years,"" Kim says, ""but it's essentially just a tick box - I wasn't really prepared for what was about to happen."" In some cases, young people can remain in their foster placement after they turn 18 - this is called a Staying Put arrangement and gives them a bit more time and support while they figure out how to live independently. But there was no chance of that for Kim. ""I knew that was never going to happen - my carer had made it very clear that she didn't want me,"" she says. So Kim needed to find somewhere else to live. In October each year National Care Leavers' Week highlights the successes of young people who've been in care and campaigns for improvements to the care system This year it falls between 26 October and 1 November When she had finished her GCSEs, Kim was told she could move out of her foster home and into a hostel and that she should arrange to go and see it. Her foster carer refused to accompany her to the viewing, but a teacher volunteered to go along, to make sure that everything was OK. ""I was lucky that my school was very hands-on and I had a good relationship with my teacher, but I don't think that's an experience that everyone has,"" Kim says. The flat at the hostel was pretty basic. She'd need to buy her own toaster and many other essentials - but she had her part-time job at Nando's, and she could plan and save and start budgeting. But then Kim was told that if she wanted the flat she'd have to sign up there and then and move in straight away. ""I was shocked and absolutely frightened,"" she says. ""I was 17 and I'd never lived on my own. This was a big transition, and everything at that moment seemed unstable and uncertain. [I thought] surely we were going to agree a date, giving me two or three weeks to prepare? ""It was just very daunting, overwhelming and sudden."" As the alternative was staying somewhere she no longer felt welcome, Kim decided she'd have to take the place at the hostel. Her teacher helped her fill in the paperwork and provided the bin bags into which Kim packed up all her worldly belongings. ""I'm so grateful my teacher did all that, but she shouldn't have needed to. Surely social services or my foster carer should have put something in place for my move? Even just given me plastic bags or boxes to put my stuff in,"" Kim says. Her foster carer didn't say a word as Kim and her teacher shuttled back and forth from the house to the car carrying all the things Kim had accumulated during the 10 years she'd lived there. ""Are you not going to say anything?"" Kim asked her foster carer when it was time to go. ""Oh, bye,"" her foster carer said as she came to the door. And that was it. ""I'd called it home and saw those people as family,"" Kim says. ""I didn't have anyone else, so to have an exit as blunt as that was hard. I thought, 'Wow, I'm just a statistic.'"" Life in the hostel was challenging. All sorts of people were coming and going at all hours, there were fights and disagreements, people threatening each other. A young man who'd recently been released from prison was living on the other side of a thin wall. Downstairs, a woman with severe mental health issues tried to kill herself and it was Kim who found her. Others lived there because they didn't get on with their parents. All of them were vulnerable, homeless and under 25. At night Kim would lie in bed and cry, unable to sleep because of the loud music that would play until the early hours. ""At the age of 17, having to deal with all that was crazy,"" she says. ""I was vulnerable myself, I was still a child, and being amongst all that it would have been easy to be coerced into doing something that I didn't want to do, purely because I was being exposed to it."" Kim was eligible to claim benefits and she still worked at Nando's, but eventually she had to quit her job to focus on her A-levels. ""I was in year 13 and it was hard - it's your biggest year - you're trying to get into uni and you're worrying about your future,"" she says. But even when it was peaceful enough for Kim to be able to concentrate on her school work, the lack of any internet connection at the hostel hampered her ability to study there. ""So I'd have to get up at six to get to college to use their Wi-Fi to catch up on work that I hadn't done the night before,"" she says. ""It was a hard environment to be in - not everyone was striving to get into uni or on to an apprenticeship - a lot of them were just sitting there waiting for a council house. I wasn't with like-minded individuals."" Without her Nando's wages to augment her benefits and unable to access her Leaving Care Grant because she wasn't yet 18, money was tight, too. ""With my benefits I had to pay for my gas and electricity, and I also had to pay Council Tax which I think is absolutely absurd if you're 17 and in full-time education,"" she says. Were you in care? How was your transition moving out of the care system? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Neither her foster carer nor her social workers had ever really talked to Kim about the possibility of going to university, but when Kim told her personal adviser she was applying for courses and had various campuses to visit, social services helped cover her costs. ""Financially they were great,"" she says. ""But when I actually got to uni they really let me down."" In 2016, after her A-levels, Kim accepted a place at Loughborough to study International Business. Her best friend's parents drove her and all of her belongings north in time for freshers' week, and although she was relieved to at last be leaving the hostel behind, adjusting to this new life was much tougher than she had envisaged. ""First year was quite an overwhelming experience and I definitely struggled,"" Kim says. ""Everyone else had parents who called them, sent food and money, and would come and see them - but I didn't have any of that. I just felt like an alien, and isolated from everyone else. I felt like I was the only care leaver, like an island."" As the end of the year approached and the other students returned home to spend Christmas with their families, Kim was left thinking, ""But where do I go?"" And eventually, things became too much. ""Mentally I broke down, and I just didn't know who to call,"" she says. ""My social worker had come to see me the week I'd moved in and then I never heard from her again. No emails, no calls, no texts, didn't visit. So when I say I didn't have anyone to call, I literally had no-one."" In desperation, Kim reached out to the pastoral care manager at her secondary school. ""I called her, crying, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I don't know what I'm going to do - I don't know anyone, I don't know the services...'"" Many young people in care have to begin living independently when they reach 18, triggering what the charity Become calls ""an abrupt transition into adulthood,externalâ¦ at a time in a young person's life when they need stability the most"" A ""concerning number"" experience homelessness after leaving care, the charity says - either immediately or before very long Jo Dixon, a research fellow at the University of York, says there can be a ""sudden falling away of support at various points in the transition from care to independent living"" - and that overstretched social workers may focus on those with the most complex and pressing needs at the expense of others She adds that the local authority ""care leaver offer"" introduced in 2017 was a big step forward, making clear what support young people leaving care can expect with regard to housing, education, employment and health ""What Kim's story really highlights is her own resilience,"" she says, ""young people's determination and self-motivation needs to be nurtured, and carers and social workers need to encourage them"" With help from her school, Kim was directed to student wellbeing and inclusion services at her university and booked in for an emergency meeting with someone who dealt with care leavers. ""I was able to go and express all my concerns and queries,"" Kim says, ""and just having that person to talk to was very important."" In time things settled down, but towards the end of the academic year Kim began to panic. ""Everyone else was worrying about their results, but I was worrying about being homeless from June to October,"" she says. Even with her part-time restaurant job and a bursary she received from social services, Kim couldn't afford to stay in her halls of residence over the summer holidays and had to move in with her best friend's family until the start of the autumn term. ""I literally had nowhere else to go,"" she says. Social services didn't know where Kim was living. No-one was keeping an eye on her or making sure she had somewhere safe to stay. She hadn't even heard from her personal adviser since the beginning of term. ""I could have been anywhere,"" she says. ""I could have been homeless."" And at the beginning of the next academic year, Kim discovered that she just didn't have enough money to make the deposit on her accommodation. With no-one else to turn to she called social services for help. She asked why her personal adviser hadn't contacted her for more than a year, and was told that the social worker in question had left. ""Does that not ring any alarm bells?"" Kim asked them. ""We think you just fell through the cracks,"" she was told. They'd tried to contact her, they said. But Kim hadn't heard from anyone and hadn't changed her number or email address. ""I know I'm not someone that you need to check in on all the time, but it would have been nice to hear just something from them,"" she says. ""I had absolutely nothing and that's poor."" Kim graduated last year. She now has her own place to live and recently started a job as a high-flier in the Civil Service. She has refused to let her past dictate her future, but looking back she feels she should have been better supported in her journey from care to independence. For one thing, she criticises social services for failing to encourage her ambition to study and do well. ""The system doesn't push young people to aim higher and pursue their passions. Social services should be driving people to university or apprenticeships or starting up their own businesses,"" she says. ""I've spoken to other young care leavers who would have gone to uni or done an apprenticeship had they known certain things would have been in place - but we're not well informed, we're just left to wing it, and at the age of 16 or 17 making decisions without being guided is very hard."" But her main criticism is that they let her fall off their radar, despite their duty of care. ""That's my issue - the safeguarding,"" she says. ""It's not OK that they didn't call in and check on me - I could have been anywhere, I could have been being exploited, and I could have been homeless."" She urges other young care leavers who might be struggling to reach out if they need help. If social services are unhelpful she points to the organisationsBecome,external, the national charity for children in care and care leavers, andPropel,external, which informs care leavers about the support available at colleges and universities. As she discovered, universities also often have wellbeing services that will help students in difficulty. In fact, during her final year at Loughborough Kim helped create new guidelines for supporting young care leavers starting at the university. ""And that was work that I was really proud to be a part of,"" she says. Kim has recently been told that her own social work case will be wound down this year. ""That's quite an interesting feeling. I've been with those guys since I was seven years old and now I'm 23,"" she says. ""But I've always been quite independent, and I'm at a stage in life now where I'm able to help myself. I should be OK."" How did you find the transition from being in care to moving out of the care system? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Tartan Army heads south ahead of England game,"This video can not be played Euro 2020: Scotland fans arrive in London for game against England Thousands of Scotland fans are heading south ahead of the team's game against England on Friday night. Train operators said many services were sold out to fans travelling to London for the Euro 2020 match at Wembley. With tickets limited due to Covid restrictions, fans have been urged not to travel unless they have organised a place to watch the game. However, some supporters groups have criticised the tournament organisers for not setting up a fan zone. Ticketless Scotland fans asked not to visit London Fan zone ticket holders to be sent testing kits Paul Goodwin, founder of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""So many Scotland fans are just so excited about the prospect. ""All these other [Covid] considerations that we've got, I think they are mindful of it. Undoubtedly it's not going to be same as normal. ""But I'm really disappointed that there isn't going to be a fan zone there, in a city the size of London."" It's thirsty work just getting to the Euros for some fans Loyal Tartan Army footsoldier Paul has chosen not to travel down for the match on this occasion - but he said it was inevitable that thousands of others would. He said: ""In some respects, this is the most important fixture in Scottish football because of the historical consequences and the fact that it doesn't come around all that often. ""I think it's just a unique part of the super-loyalty that football fans have. They feel they have to be part of it. ""We can't go out and kick a ball on the park, but we can be part of that unique aspect that the Tartan Army brings."" Singing fans set out on their way to London from Glasgow By BBC Scotland's Steven Godden, in London For Scotland fans games don't come bigger than England at Wembley. Tickets or no tickets, the thousands who've travelled weren't about to miss it. The journey has been a mixture of planes, trains and automobiles. The London Mayor was among those asking fans not to travel unless they have somewhere safe to watch the game. And so, behind their masks on the morning flight from Edinburgh, kilted supporters were working out their plans for bar bookings. At Kings Cross station, meanwhile, the swollen crowds underneath the old clock signalled the arrival of another train from Scotland. Every time it was the cue for a quick, enthusiastic rattle through the Tartan Army songbook - ""Super John McGinn"" a particular favourite - before fans started to spread out across the pubs and parks of London. With the traditional gathering point Trafalgar Square off limits, Leicester Square seems like a popular alternative this evening. Hundreds of fans have gathered there. They're loud, well oiled and it didn't take long for the first one to find his way into the fountain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scotland lost their first game 2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Iain Meiklejohn and his son Aleks, from Edinburgh, tweeted: ""There are road trips, then there's a Wembley road trip!"" Ticketless fans have beenurged not to travel to Londonunless they have organised somewhere to watch the match because space to congregate will be limited. Wembley will be open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. And Scotland fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square meeting place as it will be reserved as a fan zone for key workers. Pubs and bars in London are also expected to limit numbers allowed in. Scotland fans were in full cry as they headed south Hamish Husband, from the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, said it was ""a bit late"" to tell fans not to travel without a place to watch the match because the minute people knew Scotland were playing England, they had booked to go. Mr Husband told BBC Scotland's the Nine there should have been more Covid-safe outdoor events offered for fans wanting to go to London. ""It's a no win situation,"" he added. He said his plea to football fans was that they must ""follow the guidelines."" ""If you're going to go down - and they are on their way - just, behave yourselves,"" he said. The one fan in London not wearing a kilt will be easy to spot Many supporters have chosen to travel down early for the match. LNER, which operates the services from Edinburgh to London's Kings Cross, said its services were sold out for both Thursday and Friday. It said its services were reservation only, and urged customers to only travel to the station if they already had a booking. Avanti West Coast, which operates the Glasgow to London line, said capacity on services had been reduced to about 40% due to social distancing. Liam McKechnie, from Edinburgh, boogied his way down to London on the train A spokesman said: ""We're monitoring demand closely and also looking at extra trains before and after the match. ""We're also reminding customers to travel safely by wearing a face covering unless they're exempt as well as strongly urging fans to plan ahead and only travel if they have a reservation."" On Thursday, a piper will play for queuing fans heading to London from Glasgow's Central Station. Scotland fans from Falkirk were among the first to leave Glasgow on Thursday morning British Transport Police said extra officers would be on duty. BTP's Supt Ricky Twyford said: ""Throughout Euro 2020, we'll have more officers at key stations and routes supporting fans, frontline rail staff and everyone else travelling during this busy time. ""In the lead up to and day of the England v Scotland game, there'll be an even further increase in officers, and we'll be working closely with Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police to ensure people's journeys are safe and secure, and disruption is kept to a minimum."" LNER services are currently alcohol free, but customers will be able to drink onboard Avanti services. Kev Lynch was among a team of football fans from the north east who set off for London on Wednesday On Wednesday night, one dedicated group of 25 or so football fans who managed to get tickets set off for Wembley from the north east. They have hired a bus to - safely, and following social distancing rules - take them down to London. Among them was Kev Lynch, 36, who told BBC Scotland he'd been away with the Tartan Army quite a few times - but this would be their first time since the pandemic began. ""Because of the restrictions, a lot of the boys didn't get tickets - we'd usually have had 50+ in normal times. ""It's the biggest game we've had in a long time."" A contingent of dedicated Tartan Army supporters from the north east are making their way to London by bus He said the excitement on Friday night would be even more intense, after Scotland ""slipped up"" by being defeated by the Czech side on Monday. ""It will be the biggest game I have been to"" since the early 2000s, he said. ""The last time Scotland got to major finals I was still in secondary school. ""The fact it's England makes it a double bonus - the auld enemy,"" adding that it would make a victory ""even sweeter"". The group will be joined later by more fans, who are flying down to join them. Because the group of about 40 have been unable to book into the same pub, they have hired a boat on the Thames to watch earlier coverage, before heading to Wembley for the Scotland match. Kev said the bus journey home would be brilliant if Scotland win - but added: ""If there's a loss, it will be a long way home."". Are you watching the Scotland-England game?

What do young Americans admire about Russia?,"For the first time since Joe Biden took office as US president, he will meet in person with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The summit in Geneva, Switzerland, comes as both sides have acknowledged relations are at a new low. Here's what three young Americans and three young Russians told us about the other country. An independent who strongly aligns with progressive values, Connor is a college student who has been ""very pleased"" with his vote for President Biden so far. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? I view the Russian government as an adversary and I believe certain conditions should be met in order for the United States to consider partnering with Putin's Russia. These conditions should require that Russia cease the imprisonment of journalists and opposition leaders. Additionally, Russia must agree to cease aggression with their southern and western neighbours. What do you think the two countries could work together on? With Russia and the United States having the first and second largest nuclear weapon stockpiles in the world, more joint denuclearisation treaties would be fantastic. I believe this joint mission is very important because it reduces the likelihood of accidents and creates an atmosphere of mutual trust. In the realm of trade, as the North Pole continues to melt, this opens an extremely fast new sea route. It would be great to see the US and Russia jointly ensure the safe passage of trade vessels. Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I greatly admire the spirit of the Russian people. They have withstood a dark and strenuous 150 years and have persevered throughout, despite all the while contending with despotic national leadership. Americans and Russians are bonded by a history of revolution, social unrest, and vast technological progress. I hope our shared history can allow us to come to a greater understanding of one another and bring about an era of reconciliation rather than escalation. This video can not be played Three things to watch as Joe Biden faces Vladimir Putin A final year student at Moscow State University, Viktor has aspirations of working as an interpreter in the future. He believes the two countries should be working together on a range of issues. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? Unfortunately, right now Russia and the US are seen mostly as foes. But I am convinced that our countries can and should become friends. They are two large nuclear powers, who have huge influence over their respective continents. Their cooperation and peaceful coexistence is in the interest of the whole world. What do you think the two countries could work together on? Russia and the US should be cooperating in as many areas as possible. The most important ones, in my view, are military security, arms control and fighting terrorism. But also in education, academic exchange programmes, technology and innovations, and fighting infectious diseases. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I most admire about the US their attitude towards protecting their nature - their national parks, as well as support of internal tourism and creating infrastructure to strengthen it. I also admire how they develop international contacts in the academic sphere and how skilled they are at attracting talent and investment from other countries. What Putin really wants from Biden Awkward conversation looms for Biden and Putin Gabrielle is a moderate Republican who voted for Joe Biden, but has been ""increasingly frustrated"" by his administration's policies and priorities. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Point blank, Russia and Vladimir Putin are intense adversaries of the United States. The global order is stronger if Russia is fiercely committed to liberal democracy, but it has proved time and time again that is not the case. Instead, it has consistently preyed upon Nato tensions and is looking to expand Russian occupation of Ukraine and the Balkans. Continuous cyberattacks, undermining confidence in elections and acts of aggression have proven that Russia has no interest in protecting or working with any country. What do you think the two countries could work together on? Given the role of Russia as a leading natural gas producer, it is vital that the United States and Russia strive to work together on clean and alternative energy sources. Steps must be taken towards transition for the future wellbeing of both countries and their economies. Over reliance on oil is both a national and regional security threat, emphasising the need for global investment and partnership on alternative clean energy sources for continued global prosperity. Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? While its citizens remain fiercely committed to democracy and freedom, the government consistently undermines them. I admire the fire and want for freedom and prosperity of the Russian people, and fiercely condemn the actions and corruption of the Russian government. This video can not be played US President Joe Biden arrives in the UK ahead of the G7 summit Alena organises media campaigns for charities. She believes Russia and the US should be partners but is sceptical of whether it is possible at present, given the tension between the two countries. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I am a pacifist and I'm against the escalation of geopolitical tensions, so I would say the US is a friend. If we, Russia, work at building friendly contacts with the US, and they do the same towards us, then our mutual cooperation will at the very least decrease international tension. What do you think the two countries could work together on? First of all, on nuclear disarmament, on the development of technology and on cooperation in space, but also in science and education. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I can't answer this very easily, as I follow European politics and the countries of the EU more closely. This video can not be played Gauging the Russian mood: BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg travels to the city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia Gordon is an aerospace engineer in Salt Lake City and a conservative voter who says he feels optimistic about the state of American politics. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Currently, I see Russia more as an adversary, largely because of President Putin. It's hard to completely decipher what has been specifically ordered by President Putin and what he chooses to allow adversarial third parties within Russia to do. In either case, he bears much of the responsibility. The recent cyber attacks, thought to originate from Russian groups, have only increased tensions. What do you think the two countries could work together on? I think just about the only thing the two countries can work on together is a new nuclear arms treaty that will include other nuclear powers such as China. There seems to be some willingness on that front from both sides. The difficult thing is that both countries have very different goals and allies, which often puts them at odds with each other. Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I love the Russian culture and people. They have a rich history and still are a major influence in Europe and around the world. FBI accuses Russia-linked hackers of attack on JBS Russia warned of 'consequences' if Navalny dies Putin sees 'double standards' over US Capitol riot A professional photographer and self-described pacifist, Katya says the two countries need to focus on fighting Covid-19 together even though they are enemies. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I think that Russia considers the US a foe, but the US isn't concerned about this as it has its own problems and concerns. And you can hardly have friends in politics. What do you think the two countries could work together on? Right now, I would say the most important thing is cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and in restoring the global economy. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I am attracted to the people's openness to each other and their tolerance. But I'm not saying that is completely universal in the US.

Ryanair launches legal challenge over travel listsThere is anger in the travel sector over how the government has made decisions over the green list.Business,"Ryanair and the owner of Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports have launched a legal challenge against the government over the travel traffic light system. They are calling for more transparency about how the government decides which countries qualify for the green list of safe places to visit amid the pandemic. EasyJet, Tui and IAG, the owner of British Airways, have backed the case. Ministers say the system ""cautiously manages the risk of new variants"". Thetraffic light system,externalrates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Travellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. Where can you go on holiday abroad? What's happening with foreign travel? Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca The challenge by Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has been put together after huge frustration within the travel industry at the inclusion of Portugal on the green list in mid-May and then its sudden removal a few weeks later. IAG, the owner of British Airways, has told the BBC it intends to join the case as an ""interested party"". One airline in support said: ""We have been asking for more transparency for some time now and so we share the serious concerns being raised by MAG concerning the lack of transparency around government decision making."" On top of this, the travel industry believes the Balearic and Greek Islands should have been included on the green list of countries last month when health data was analysed. In a separate development, thebosses of Jet2 and EasyJet Holidayshave told the BBC they do not understand why low infection destinations like Mallorca were left off the green list in the last review and questioned how government decisions are made. The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, wants Boris Johnson to explain the scientific basis behind the system which he says the government ""seems to make up"" as it goes along. Further signatories to the challenge are set to be revealed on Thursday. They are demanding a fast response as the crucial summer season edges closer. The government said at the time that moving Portugal from the green to amber list was necessary because of an increase in infection rates in the country, and the emergence of the ""Nepal variant"", a mutation of the Delta version of the virus first detected in India. There were concerns that vaccines would not work as well on this particular mutation. The move meant that some British holidaymakers had to cut short their holidays anddash back from Portugal on extra flightsput on by airlines before the country came off the green travel list in early June. Travellers the BBC spoke to said it cost them hundreds of pounds to book new flights to get home before the deadline. Travel bosses are concerned the damage of these sudden reversals will continue to erode the confidence of the British travelling public. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Ryanair boss criticises 'unnecessary disruption' over Portugal travel They maintain there is huge pent-up demand to travel abroad this summer, following three coronavirus lockdowns and huge numbers of cancelled or postponed holidays. But epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out."" ""We have provided Â£7bn to help support for the industry during the pandemic."" The spokesperson added that the government could not comment on legal proceedings.

PM calls Hancock hopeless in message revealed by CummingsNo 10 says Boris Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary after Mr Cummings' latest attack.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Mr Hancock was asked by a reporter whether he was ""hopeless"" - he responded with ""I don't think so"" Dominic Cummings has published expletive-laden messages, apparently from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"". It is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words between Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, and Matt Hancock over the handling of the pandemic. Downing Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages. But the PM's official spokesman insisted Mr Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary. In a 7,000-word blog, Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of trying to rewrite history during a select committee hearing last week which was examining how the government has managed various aspects of the crisis. He also took aim at Mr Johnson, claiming he had ""lied about failures"" during the government's initial response to the pandemic. ""If No 10 is prepared to lie so deeply and widely about such vital issues of life and death last year, it cannot be trusted now either on Covid or any other crucial issue of war and peace,"" Mr Cummings wrote. Kuenssberg: Cummings' gradual reveal of what was in that box Hancock defends not bringing in earlier lockdown Fact-checking Matt Hancock's Covid claims Dominic Cummings: The most explosive claims Mr Cummings told MPs three weeks ago that the health secretary had lied to the prime minister about testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes at the start of the pandemic - something firmly denied by Mr Hancock. A source close to Mr Hancock said: ""The health secretary answered many of Mr Cummings' claims at a lengthy session in front of MPs. ""Mr Cummings has still failed to provide evidence to substantiate his claims. ""The health secretary continues to work with the prime minister on the vaccine programme and getting us out of this pandemic as quickly as possible."" Mr Cummings, who was forced out of Downing Street last year, claims the version of events given to the committee by Mr Hancock was ""fiction"". The former aide appears to have kept WhatsApp messages from his time in government and selected six to share with readers of his blog. One of them appears to show an exchange between Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings on 27 March last year. Mr Cummings highlights the ramping up of testing capacity in the US and criticises Mr Hancock for saying he was ""sceptical"" about meeting a target. Mr Johnson purportedly responds: ""Totally [expletive] hopeless."" Mr Cummings also published another private message about the struggle to procure ventilators for Covid-19 patients. ""It's Hancock. He has been hopeless,"" a contact appearing to be Mr Johnson replies on 27 March last year. In another message, on 27 April last year, the prime minister appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) ""a disaster"" and alludes to diverting some responsibilities to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,"" Mr Johnson apparently adds. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to be drawn on these claims"", adding that the prime minister has ""worked very closely with the health secretary and continues to do so"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Mr Hancock in a Commons debate that he had been ""forever branded Hopeless Hancock by his own leader"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said a public inquiry into the pandemic promised for next spring was now needed ""as quickly as possible"". Mr Cummings suggests in his blog that any inquiry would not ""start for years"" as it was ""designed to punt the tricky parts until after this PM has gone"". This video can not be played ""Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die"", Dominic Cummings told MPs ""Unlike other PMs, this one has a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election, he wants to make money and have fun not 'go on and on',"" writes Mr Cummings. But with the Conservatives riding high in the opinion polls, there is no incentive for the party's MPs to move against Mr Johnson, despite the ""systemic incompetence"" surrounding him, he adds. Downing Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: ""The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands."" Let's start with a quick political quiz. Q: Who has the safest job in cabinet? A: Matt Hancock Q: Why? A: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary. He could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide. If he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic. And if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner. Mr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis. But by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match. And by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards. Mr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due tolast year's lockdown drive to Durham. But his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved. Giving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. He claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had ""repeatedly lied about the failures last year"" and accuses them of now trying to ""rewrite history"", with the prime minister ""encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament"". Mr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. In one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus. He said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were ""less pleasant for everybody but much more productive"". He said this was because Mr Raab ""can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes"". This video can not be played Five things Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs He went on to say that ""as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree"". Downing Street said it was ""not going to engage"" with this claim. And on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard. ""The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary. ""He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence."" Mr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters. He has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic.

"UK aid cuts risk millions of lives, warns WHOMove leaves millions of the worldâs poorest at risk from âneglected tropical diseasesâ, says agency.UK","Cuts to the UK's aid budget will leave millions of people at risk of dying from ""neglected tropical diseases"", the World Health Organization has said. Nearly 280 million lifesaving tablets are likely to expire and have to be incinerated due to the withdrawal of UK money, the United Nations agency said. The UK's annual foreign aid budget has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, a cut of almost Â£4bn. Ministers say Â£10bn will be still spent in 2021, with Â£1.3bn on global health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has joined many other agencies in warning about the impact of the Treasury's decision to cut foreign aid this year. In a submission to the International Development Committee,external- which is conducting an inquiry into the future of UK aid - the WHO said the cuts would leave millions of the world's poorest people at risk from so-called ""neglected tropical diseases"". These include elephantiasis, trachoma and Guinea Worm and are among 20 disease groups that mainly affect people in the poorest countries. They are preventable but without treatment the WHO said they ""kill, blind, disfigure and maim"". Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Rebel Tories blocked in bid to reverse aid cuts The WHO said that prior to its aid cuts, the UK provided funding to 19 countries through its ""flagship"" health programme called Accelerating the Sustainable Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (Ascend). Much of the UK's aid helped distribute lifesaving medicines but without that help, the agency said it was likely 277 million tablets would expire and have to be incinerated. ""No obvious alternative source of funding exists to fill the funding gaps that will be left by the exit of Ascend,"" the WHO added. The Foreign Office said it had been forced by financial impact of the pandemic to take tough decisions to leave programmes that treated these diseases. ""The seismic impact of the pandemic forced the tough decision to temporarily reduce the aid budget and exit some programmes, including the Accelerating the Sustainable Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases programme,"" a statement said. ""We will still spend more than Â£10bn this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health, including Â£1.3bn on global health. ""We will focus on the UK's position at the forefront of the international response to Covid-19, and will continue to support programmes in countries affected by neglected tropical diseases."" The Conservative Party committed to spending 0.7% in its manifesto for the 2019 general election - but last year ministers decided to reduce this year's spending, saying it was temporary and hard to justify given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the Covid pandemic.

"Covid vaccine offer to children over 12 not likelySome groups of children may be vaccinated - but not all, the UK's vaccine experts are expected to say.HealthComments","In the US, a 13-year-old boy is vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told. Certain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all. A statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days. The government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout. Vaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government. There has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 afterregulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently. But the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter. Current advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system. The committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision. Should all children get a Covid vaccine? How can I get my second jab sooner? Jabs to be compulsory for England care home staff The MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number. At the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low. However, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. Children's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low. Some people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated. On the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open. ""This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,"" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage. He said he was ""veering towards not vaccinating children"" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead. ""The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,"" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools. Vaccinating children would be ""mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission"", he added. It's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May. A target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. There are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines. ""We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course."" Should all children get a Covid vaccine?

"âUnforgivable' security mistakes before arena bombA man who lost his partner in the arena bomb says security failings made it ""easy"" for the bomber.","This video can not be played Paul Price and his partner, Elaine McIver, were at the Manchester Arena when the bomb exploded Paul Price does not know how close he was to death on the night of the Manchester Arena bombing. Though he remained awake in the horrific minutes that followed, he has barely any memory of it, and for that he is grateful. His injuries were catastrophic, a seemingly endless catalogue of destruction from which his body will never fully recover. Dozens of surgeries. Shrapnel still embedded in his body. Permanent loss of function in his hand and leg. Weekly painful rehab sessions. But nothing compares to the loss of his partner Elaine McIver, who was among the 22 people killed when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device. ""She was the love of my life, I was the love of her life"", he said. For a long time he could not bring himself to talk about her. ""It was just too upsetting,"" he said. ""And I'm ashamed to say it, but for such a long time I remember thinking my hurt was so much that I thought if someone could give me a tablet and I could forget about her, I'd be OK. ""Now her memory to me is a blessing and I love talking about her. And I'm glad of that."" ""She was the love of my life,"" says Paul Price about Elaine McIver Ms McIver was a detective constable who had worked for Cheshire Police and the North West regional crime unit Titan. She was 43 when she died - off duty and with Mr Price to collect his daughter from the Ariana Grande concert. Mr Price describes how much pride she took in her work and how proud she was to be a police officer, helping to keep people safe. It has only made it harder to learn about failings in security in May 2017, which he believes made it ""easy"" for the bomber to slip through the net, unchallenged by anyone in authority. On Thursday, the first findings from the inquiry will be made public. The report will focus on the security arrangements at the arena, and is likely to be critical. Mr Price said: ""They all say we will learn from this... I don't know. ""The failings go back a long time, so many missed chances and it's hard to hear. ""There were failings on the night but the weeks, months before made it easy for him and it shouldn't have been so easy."" Elaine McIver was one of 22 people killed in the May 2017 bombing Who were the people killed in the attack? On the night Abedi murdered Ms McIver and 21 others, he hid for nearly an hour in a CCTV blind spot in the foyer of the Manchester Arena - a public area connected to the railway station next door. It was a spot the bomber had planned carefully in repeated hostile reconnaissance trips over previous days. It was here he waited as parents and families gathered to collect loved ones leaving the concert, and it was here that he walked into the crowd at 22:31 BST and blew himself up. Hours of CCTV examined by the inquiry show Abedi earlier walking around the station, bent under the weight of his bulging rucksack, and at one point fiddling with wires sticking out of his clothes. Mr Price said he has felt particularly upset by revelations at the inquiry about the behaviour of British Transport Police (BTP), who were responsible for policing the station and foyer areas. He has learned that against instructions, there was no police officer stationed in the foyer for the end of the concert. ""I didn't want to be let down by BTP, but I was,"" he said. ""And I think that hurt more than anything because Elaine was a police officer."" Though they raced to help after the bomb went off, the officers on duty that night have been criticised for their behaviour in the hours leading up to the atrocity - including a two-hour dinner break and a 10-mile round trip to buy a kebab. At one point, when Abedi took his final trip through the station to his hiding place in the foyer, there were no BTP officers on duty in the area at all. Mr Price said: ""After the explosion there was heroics and you know, they stepped up, but the failings before the explosion were unforgivable as far as I'm concerned. ""They were there to protect, and they weren't there."" BTP has accepted the attack happened on its watch and it let the public down, but it says its officers did act with heroism following the explosion. But it was not only BTP who were responsible for keeping people safe in that area. Arena operators SMG and its contracted event security providers Showsec also shared responsibility. Paul Price says he is ""working on his recovery and trying to look forwards"" For Mr Price, he feels there has been a sense of blame being shifted and an unwillingness by corporations to admit failings in their preparedness for an attack of this kind. He said: ""I was disappointed in SMG and Showsec to begin with, because they just seemed to be passing the buck between one another. ""I thought - just admit the failings and try and learn from it. But it just seemed to be that they just didn't want the blame on them."" SMG, Showsec and British Transport Police have all accepted shortcomings in their risk assessments. But SMG said other accusations that it prioritised profit over safety were unfair, while Showsec said its own errors did not contribute to the bombing. Today will be yet another difficult day for Mr Price and all those impacted by the atrocity at Manchester Arena. Meanwhile, he is still working on his recovery and trying to look forwards. He said: ""For such a long time I thought I could never be happy again, I felt life was a prison sentence I had to endure... the world seems a lonely place now, and frightening for me. ""But you know, I can see glimmers of light now... I am still alive, I've got to live my life for my kids, for everyone who's helped me. ""A lot of people have invested a lot of time in me to get me back on my feet. I can't let them down, and I can't let Elaine down.""

Eviction ban on firms not paying rent is extendedThe government's ban on landlords evicting companies in rent debt will now end in March 2022,"A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months. The ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June. Treasury Secretary Stephen Barclay said the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, ""present additional challenges"" to business. It is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are Â£5bn in rent debt. While retailers and hospitality firms welcomed the measures, landlords voiced dismay and again warned that some profitable tenants were abusing the ban to avoid paying rent they can afford. Mr Barclay told the Commons: ""Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,"" Mr Barclay told the Commons. He also announced plans for a binding arbitration scheme to resolve disputes between landlords and commercial tenants. Mr Barclay said the scheme should be in place for when the eviction ban is lifted. He said the measures ""strike the right balance"" between protecting landlords and supporting businesses most in need. But Mr Barclay added: ""To be clear, all tenants should start to pay rent again in accordance with the terms of their lease or as otherwise agreed with their landlord as soon as restrictions are removed on their sector if they are not already doing so."" We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Firms ask for more help after 'haemorrhaging cash' Thousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms. In April last year the government blocked legal attempts to evict shops, restaurants and other businesses that had stopped paying rent, as part of emergency measures to soften the economic impact of the pandemic. Mr Barclay told the Commons his measures ""strike the right balance"". Hospitality leaders had called for an extension of the moratorium and for more financial support from the government. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans to remove remaining pandemic restrictions on 21 June have been pushed back to 19 July amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Last week, the chief executives of trade groups UK Hospitality and British Retail Consortium (BRC) told MPs that both sectors have accrued a combined Â£5bn in rent debt. Data for the first quarter of 2021 shows that only 74% of rent was collected by landlords 60 days following the end of the period after tenants were battered by the pandemic. Hospitality, leisure and retail operators have also benefited from a business rates holiday since the start of the crisis. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, many of whose members have felt lockdown most acutely, said the extension comes ""in the nick of time"". She said: ""Just as retailers feared a wave of legal action by landlords, the government has stepped in to offer both landlords and tenants more time to negotiate. Retailers need time to trade their way out of debt; this announcement does exactly that."" The Institute of Directors (IoD) also said firms across the country would welcome the extension, but the Treasury could have gone further. Dr Roger Barker, the IoD's director of policy, said: ""This is only one element of the cliff edge that we have been calling on government to address. ""At the end of this month businesses will still face the tapering off of furlough and business rates relief, and the suspension of wrongful trading liability. The government must hold its nerve and push out its business support measures until the job is properly done."" However, landlords were critical of the measures, with Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, saying: ""The government has failed to recognise that commercial property owners are essential to the health of our town centres - to creating economic growth, jobs and opportunity."" She said the majority of property owners had already reached agreement with their tenants on rent, and millions of pounds have been provided to the most vulnerable tenants in the sectors most impacted by Covid-19. ""That support will continue in light of the delay in the recovery roadmap for those businesses that need it,"" Ms Leach said. ""Another blanket extension to the moratoriums will provide further opportunity for those well-capitalised businesses who can afford to pay rent, but are refusing to do so, to continue their abuse of government and property owners' support and will cast a long shadow over future investment to build back better,"" she said. The ban on tenant evictions was just one of the government support measures that is due to start wearing off on 1 July. A business rate holiday will end with firms asked to pay 33% of their normal bill - rising to 100% by next March, while government contributions to furloughed staff wages will drop by 10% with employers making up the difference. Extending these two measures would be very expensive for the government - extending an eviction ban costs it nothing - leaving the bomb in the lap of the landlord. The government insisted the extension to March would allow new legislation to be drafted to create an arbitration system to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Landlords big and small point out that they will have received no income from anyone who didn't want to pay (even if they could) for two years by next March. Support for them has largely come in the form of forbearance from their own banks whose patience may begin to run out. Many also point out that the process of investment and repurposing commercial business premises for a post pandemic age will fall to them. While many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that landlord's knock at the door can be ignored for another nine months, someone will be left holding a rent arrears bomb - and the government is keen it's not them.

Those attending include deputy leader Paula Bradley, Lord Morrow, Diane Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Sammy Wilson, Education Minister Michelle McIlveen, William Humphrey, Tom Buchanan and Peter Weir.

BBC News NI understands the vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots nominating Mr Givan as first minister, during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting. This video can not be played 'We will make this a better place for everyone' - Paul Givan Sammy Wilson later said the feeling of the party was ""very, very clear"". ""What has been done today... shouldn't have been done and the vast majority of people believe that is the case,"" said the East Antrim MP. LIVE: Reaction as DUP row deepens after FM nomination Asked if he had confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said any leader should ""bring people along with them"" and that could not be achieved by ""ignoring the views of a huge number of people"". DUP leader Edwin Poots arrives at DUP headquarters ahead of a meeting of party officers on Thursday ""A leader who acts without the support of even a marginal majority of his party has to live with the consequences of that,"" he said. Asked on his way into the meeting if there will be a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots, Mr Wilson said: ""Wait and see."" ""I think Edwin has got to ask does he have any confidence in the party now? If he decides to ignore the views of the party, maybe he doesn't have any confidence in us,"" he added. DUP East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson says the first minister nomination should not have taken place on Thursday The first and deputy first minister nominations followed a late-night dealafter talks involving Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewisended a stalemate over Irish language laws, with Mr Lewis declaring legislation would be brought in by Westminster in October if not first introduced at Stormont. But DUP MPs and peers wrote to Mr Poots expressing their concern at the deal, asking him to meet them ""to explain the basis of your agreement with the secretary of state and Sinn FÃ©in before any further steps are taken in this process, including the nomination of a first minister"". Signatories included Sir Jeffrey and Mr Wilson, as well as MPs Gregory Campbell, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Paul Girvan, and Carla Lockhart, along with Lord Morrow, Lord Browne, Lord Hea, Lord McCrea and Lord Dodds. Some DUP MPs also joined the MLA meeting to vote on Mr Givan's nomination, but Mr Poots and Mr Givan left before the vote was taken, walking past Mr Wilson while he was speaking, BBC News NI understands. Mr Wilson said the feeling of party members at the meeting about whether to nominate a first minister was ""very clear"". ""It wasn't a marginal vote. It was a clear vote,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC's Talkback programme. Just over a month since he was elected leader of the DUP, Edwin Poots has entered party headquarters tonight looking very sullen as those crisis talks got under way. There is real anger across all levels of the party over what has unfolded in the last 24 hours. It would be wrong to assume this anger isn't going to lead to a vote of no confidence in Mr Poots at the meeting of party officers, currently taking place. If there is a vote of no confidence and Mr Poots loses it, that doesn't necessarily mean he is out as party leader. It will be over to the 130-strong party executive to decide what happens, and that's scheduled to meet again next Thursday. That has MLAs, MPs, peers and members of the constituency associations all coming together. While a special sitting of the assembly took place at 12:00 BST to nominate the first and deputy first ministers, former first minister Arlene Foster tweeted to say she hoped everyone was enjoying their day.

Officially nominating Mr Givan, Mr Poots said the assembly needed more people like him to win for unionism. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said the new executive would face many challenges but that Ms O'Neill was a strong and dedicated leader. Accepting the nomination, Mr Givan said Mr Poots was a leader ""who had a big heart for the people around him"". Ms O'Neill said the new executive's top priority was its response to the Covid crisis, the continued successful rollout of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, and rebuilding the economy. When Arlene Fosterstood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. They then had seven days to nominate replacements. Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Mr Poots had named Mr Givanas its pick to replace Mrs Foster, while Sinn FÃ©in said Ms O'Neill would resume her post as deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in had wanted commitments from the DUP over a timetable for implementing Irish language legislation, as set out in theNew Decade, New Approach,externaldeal that restored power sharing in January 2020. The party said this was not forthcoming, and it called on Mr Lewis to bring in Irish language legislation via Westminster. Mr Poots has said he was committed to implementing all of the NDNA commitments, including those around Irish language, but not necessarily before the end of the current assembly mandate in May 2022. When a deal was reached in the early hours of Thursday, Mr Lewis said he was ""disappointed"" the Stormont executive had not brought Irish language legislation forward in the assembly. ""However, following my intensive negotiations with the parties over the last few days, I can confirm that if the executive has not progressed legislation by the end of September, the UK government will take the legislation through Parliament in Westminster,"" he said. ""If that becomes necessary, we will introduce legislation in October 2021."" Brandon Lewis says Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step-in and legislate on Irish language commitments Mr Lewis said later on Thursday that Mr Poots was aware that he was agreeing to the possibility that Westminster would step in and legislate on Irish language commitments. ""Edwin Poots was very clear that he would be nominating a first minister understanding that we will be legislating in October for a package, a balanced package, exactly as per NDNA, which both parties signed up to,"" he said. ""Mr Poots was very clear that should be delivered at Stormont. I agree with that. That's why I've given that space to allow the executive to look at delivering that here through the executive."" Mr Poots said his party had not been ""shirking away"" from NDNA, and said there was ""a lot in the cultural package for unionism"". He said the pandemic was the reason Irish language legislation had not been implemented. ""If anybody thought that it should have been prioritised ahead of that - that would have been very foolish,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday. ""In terms of actually dealing with all of the issues contained within [New Decade New Approach], quite a number of those have not been implemented as a result of Covid-19."" Sinn FÃ©in 'will not back new FM without Irish law' Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term Ms McDonald said Irish speakers had been waiting for 15 years for basic rights and recognition, which was important for wider society because power-sharing was ""based on inclusion, respect and equality"". Campaigners have been calling for legislation to support the Irish language ""On this basis of what has been agreed I am happy to confirm that Sinn FÃ©in will nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and will participate fully in the five-party executive,"" she said. ""We have a huge amount of work ahead of us as we come out of Covid and as we continue to rebuild the economy, get people back to work and tackle hospital waiting lists."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the commitment to legislate for the cultural package, but said he was disappointed that reportedly intensive negotiations had resulted in no progress on funding hospital waiting lists, addressing the challenges of the Northern Ireland protocol or investing in the economy. ""If we're serious about transforming this place, we need to get real about addressing those challenges,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie told the assembly that he did not want to see ""ransom politics"" holding politicians to account. ""What I want to see is collaborative politics, where we all see the problem in front of us, where we all work to try and find a solution,"" Mr Beattie said. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said she was ""disappointed"" as parties signed up to NDNA on the understanding it would be fulfilled. ""It seems like a very immature type of politics that we have to rely on him [Brandon Lewis] to do that [legislate for Irish language] because we can't stand over the decisions that we make,"" said Ms Long. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the day's events marked the ""first big humiliation and failure of Edwin Poots' leadership"". ""This is the portent of things to come as once more Sinn FÃ©in rule prevails, with the DUP the onlooking bridesmaid,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the stability of Northern Ireland's executive was critical for peace and security in Northern Ireland. Last week, the NI Executive outlined a number of indicative dates, including relaxing the ban on live music. The executive met on Thursday afternoon, but ministers delayed easing further restrictionsto an indicative date of 5 July, with another review due to take place on 1 July.
