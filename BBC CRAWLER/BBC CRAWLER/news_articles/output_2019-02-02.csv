Russia suspends role in nuclear pact,"This video can not be played Are we on the cusp of a new nuclear arms race? Russia has suspended its involvement in the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) following a similar decision by the US. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would start developing new missiles. On Friday, the US, which has long accused Russia of violating the treaty, formally announced it was suspending its obligations under the agreement. Signed in 1987 by the US and USSR, it banned the use of short and medium-range missiles by both countries. ""Our American partners announced that they are suspending their participation in the treaty, and we are suspending it too,"" Mr Putin said on Saturday. ""All of our proposals in this sphere, as before, remain on the table, the doors for talks are open,"" he added. Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles Is nuclear control set to self-destruct? Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord Earlier on Saturday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC: ""All [European] allies agree with the United States because Russia has violated the treaty for several years. They are deploying more and more of the new nuclear capable missiles in Europe."" He also said the six-month period the US had given Russia to return to full compliance should be taken advantage of. Russia has denied violating the INF accord. The Americans say they have evidence that a new Russian missile falls within the 500-5,500km (310-3,400 miles) range banned by the treaty. Some US officials have said that a number of 9M729 missiles - known to Nato as SSC-8 - have already been deployed. Russia's new 9M729 missile worries the US and its allies The evidence has been put to Washington's Nato allies andthey have all backed the US case. In December, the Trump administration gave Russia 60 days to return to compliance or the US would also cease to honour its terms. Besides denying breaking the INF treaty, Moscow says that US anti-ballistic missile interceptors being deployed in Eastern Europe could potentially violate the terms of the agreement. At Saturday's meeting with his foreign and defence ministers, President Putin said work would begin on creating new weapons. These, he said, included a land-based version of Russia's sea-launched Kalibr cruise missile, and new hypersonic weapons which can travel more than five times the speed of sound. But Mr Putin said Moscow would not get dragged into an expensive arms race, and would not deploy short- and medium-range missiles unless US weapons were deployed there first. Such an arms race would be a major concern for European countries. ""These new missiles are mobile, hard to detect, nuclear capable, can reach European cities and they have hardly any warning time at all so they reduce the threshold for any potential use of nuclear weapons in a conflict,"" Nato's Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Putin warns Europe on hosting US missiles Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty plan US to leave nuclear treaty with Russia Russia denies breaking missile treaty US: Russia 'violated missile treaty' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Nissan to 'pull' making new model in UK,"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan is expected to announce that it is cancelling a planned investment at its plant in Sunderland. In 2016 the car maker said it would build the new model of its X-Trail SUV in the UK after receiving ""assurances"" from the government over Brexit. The Japanese company is expected to say investment will be now be pulled, rather than existing work being halted. Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, spoke of her concern at the prospect. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy,"" she tweeted. ""So many jobs and livelihoods depend on Nissan's success."" Labour Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott suggested there was an ""inevitable role that Brexit plays here.... None of it is conducive to encouraging business investment in this country"". ""I will be doing everything I can to protect the jobs at the Sunderland plant. I will be asking for the government to intervene, and will stay in close contact with the company itself,"" she said in aTwitter post,external. Nissan has produced cars at Sunderland since 1986 and employs almost 7,000 people. Nissanannounced in October 2016it would build the next-generation X-Trail and Qashqai at Sunderland. Production of the Qashqai - the best-selling crossover vehicle in Europe - makes up the majority of the current work at Sunderland and is not expected to be affected by the announcement on the X-Trail. BBC business reporter Rob Young said: ""The reasons for the investment cancellation are not known, but the industry as a whole has been warning Brexit uncertainty might hit investment."" Our correspondent said as the announcement was expected to be about planned future investment, the impact on Nissan's current workforce may be very minimal. Nissan refused to shed light on the situation. A spokesman said it ""does not comment on rumour or speculation"". There had been concerns that Nissan - part-owned by France's Renault - could move production to France in future to avoid any post-Brexit EU tariffs. But when the X-Trail investment was initially announced, Nissan said hundreds of jobs would be created at the Sunderland plant. It sparked questions over whether a deal between the car-maker and the government had been struck although ministers insisted that no ""financial compensation"" had been offered. Peter Campbell, the motor industry correspondent at the Financial Times, said the fall in demand for diesels would appear to be one of the main factors in the announcement as Nissan was planning to make mainly diesel versions of the X-Trail in Sunderland. He told the BBC: ""If Nissan decided to make those cars in petrol it would have to ship engines over from Japan and the cost of doing that work against the decision to build it in the UK."" He added: ""There are obviously other factors - car sales are down in the UK, they have fallen across Europe...  and there is obviously the overhang of Brexit and the worries of the impact that might have on a plant that exports about 80% of its vehicles."" Last April,Nissan said it was to cut hundreds of jobs at Sunderland, amid a decline in diesel sales.

Nuclear control self-destruction?,"This video can not be played Are we on the cusp of a new nuclear arms race? Never has the future of nuclear arms control seemed so uncertain. At risk is not just the collapse of existing treaties, but a whole manner of interaction between Russia and the United States that has been crucial to maintaining stability over decades. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo served Russia notice. The US is suspending its participation in the important Cold War-era disarmament agreement - the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as of 2nd February. Russia, the US insists, has long been in breach of this agreement. And if it does not return to compliance within six months, the US will walk away from the INF Treaty altogether. This 1987 agreement with the ex-Soviet Union removed a whole category of land-based nuclear missiles: those with ranges of between 500 and 5,500km (310 and 3,100 miles). 1989: A Soviet SS-23 missile is destroyed, under the INF treaty Being small, highly mobile, and located relatively close to their potential targets, they were seen as highly destabilising. In the late 1970s Soviet Russia deployed the SS-20 missile to threaten targets in Western Europe, causing alarm in many Nato capitals. The US responded by deploying Cruise and Pershing weapons in a number of European countries. But after the agreement, all these weapons were removed and destroyed. The Trump administration says that a new Russian missile, designated the 9M729 and known to Nato as the SSC-8, breaches the INF Treaty. Back in December, Mr Pompeo gave Russian President Vladimir Putin 60 days to return to compliance or the US would also cease to honour its terms. Russia insists that it is abiding by the agreement, and raises concerns about Washington's own adherence to the deal. The Americans say they have powerful evidence that, over several years, Russia has developed and now fielded a missile that falls within the range that is banned by the INF Treaty. This, by the way, is not a new idea raised by the Trump administration. President Barack Obama too was concerned about what the Russians were doing. The evidence has been put to Washington's Nato allies andthey have all backed the US case.Many of them though are privately not happy to see the US itself withdraw from the treaty, preferring that more time be given to try to reach an accord with the Russians. Moscow has arguments of its own, asserting for example that US anti-ballistic missile interceptors deployed today in Romania, but soon to Poland as well, could potentially fall into the INF agreement's terms if their warheads were changed. But such a potential future breach is very different from what the US is charging Russia with having done. Indeed according to some reports, unnamed US officials are claiming that Russia has already deployed around 100 of the new missiles. Or, to put it another way, does either country really want to maintain the treaty? On the face of it the answer is no. Statements from Mr Pompeo, and indeed from Nato, hold out the hope that Moscow may change its mind. But it would be a significant climb-down. And there have been some 30 instances of contacts between US and Russian officials on this subject over recent years. A last-minute resolution is unlikely. If indeed Russia is in breach of the agreement, as Nato insists, then it clearly believes that developing a weapon in this category has some strategic value. And there is no hint of Russia backing down. As far as the Americans and their allies are concerned, the ball is in Moscow's court. It is the Russian government that has sealed the INF agreement's fate. If US builds missiles so will we - Putin Russia breaching missile treaty - Nato Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' But there is a strong sentiment in both the Pentagon and White House that the agreement is out of date. US officials point to China's huge arsenal of intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which it has been able to develop unconstrained by any treaty.  In this light, the US sees the INF deal as a brake on its own strategic capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Perhaps the Europeans who are most alarmed (and most at risk) by the deployment of new Russian missiles can bring their weight to bear. But if both Washington and Moscow see good reasons for abandoning the treaty, then the other Nato countries are unlikely to pull a renewed INF agreement out of the hat. During the Cold War years, arms control and disarmament agreements played a vital role, and not just in reducing the numbers of nuclear missiles and maintaining stability. They were the central element in the East-West dialogue. This was the domain where Washington and Moscow met across the table as equals. Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan sign the INF treaty in December 1987 It continued after the Cold War with the new START treaty, signed during the Obama administration, setting limits on long-range strategic missiles. If the INF Treaty unravels, then many experts fear for the future of the new START agreement, which expires in February 2021, unless the two parties agree to extend it. Will they even want to, given the state of their relations? This is the paradox of arms control. Such agreements maybe don't matter so much in times of peace and stability; but when tensions mount they really do. The likely demise of the INF Treaty and the fate of the broader arms control edifice it represents is also a sign of the dramatic shift under way in world affairs. The US concern about China points to this. Maybe the era of bilateral arms control, involving just Washington and Moscow, is coming to an end. China is now a significant nuclear player. Some 10 other countries beyond the US and Russia have fielded intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The contrary view asserts that yes, the ""bilateral era"" is ending, but Russia and the US still have by far the largest strategic arsenals and that controlling these remains a good thing in itself. It also sets a benchmark for disarmament which should be extended to include other countries. But with relations between Russia and the West at a low ebb, with a US president asserting the credo of ""America First"" and with Russia pursuing its own assertive foreign policy, it is hard to see the INF Treaty or even new START surviving. Worse, it is hard to see US-Russian relations improving any time soon. The fact that their competition is now only one aspect of a multi-polar battle for strategic and economic dominance makes a world without arms control both more likely and more dangerous.

Nissan to build new models in Sunderland,"This video can not be played Nissan worker: ""If Nissan went down, the north-east would be gone"" Nissan has confirmed it will build both the new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant following government ""support and assurances"". The Japanese company's commitment,externalto Britain's biggest car plant had been in doubt following the EU referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government must make public any deals struck with the firm. However, Business Secretary Greg Clark said there was ""no question of financial compensation"" for Nissan. The company's decision comes aseconomic growthin the three months after the Brexit vote confounded expectations, increasing by 0.5% - slower than the 0.7% in the previous quarter but higher than analysts' estimates of about 0.3%. Nissan's decision is the first major development for the car industry since the Brexit vote and secures 7,000 jobs. ""The support and assurances of the UK government enabled us to decide that the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland,"" said Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief executive, adding that he welcomed Prime Minister Theresa May's ""commitment to the automotive industry in Britain"". Last month, he warned that Nissan might not invest in the Sunderland plant unless the government guaranteed compensation for costs related to any new trade tariffs resulting from Brexit. Mrs May described the announcement as ""fantastic news"", adding: ""This vote of confidence shows Britain is open for business."" Mr Clark said: ""The fact Nissan have not only made a long-term commitment to build the next generation Qashqai and X-Trail at Sunderland, but decided to upgrade their factory to a super-plant, manufacturing over 600,000 cars a year, is proof of the strength of the sector."" A Nissan spokesman said making the X-Trail at Sunderland could lead to hundreds of new jobs being created in the coming years. It will be the first time the model has been made outside Japan. The production line was stopped at 11am on Thursday so workers could be told about the decision. A senior Nissan Europe executive, Colin Lawther, said the company had received ""no special deal"". This video can not be played Nissan boss Colin Lawther tells The World At One there has been no special deal ""It's just a commitment from the government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive,"" he told the BBC. ""We would expect nothing for us that the rest of the industry wouldn't be able to have access to. We see this as a whole industry thing, not a Nissan thing."" We don't know the details of the ""support and assurance"" that Nissan extracted from the UK government. But it was clearly enough to secure a commitment from Nissan to build not one, but two new cars at the Sunderland plant. The promise to shield Nissan from the impact of Brexit will not be lost on rival manufacturers, both those already in the UK as well as those that might be tempted to come. Will other carmakers with big investment decisions to make now favour Britain? It's possible - but now only after securing a few government guarantees. The UK car industry has been vocal in warning about the impact of an exit from the single market. Although the cheaper pound makes their exports more attractive, a hard Brexit and the prospect of trade tariffs will add to their costs. It seems likely that the government has now promised some sort of financial support to cushion Nissan against such an impact. That will be controversial, of course. But once outside the EU, it won't necessarily be illegal. The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Building the X-Trail SUV is an unexpected addition to the model line-up at Sunderland, which makes almost one in three cars built in Britain and produced 475,000 vehicles last year - 80% of which were exported. The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost nine million cars over the past three decades. Production of the next Qashqai model is expected to begin in 2018 or 2019. Mike Hawes, chief executive of industry body the SMMT, said Nissan's announcement was good news for the UK's automotive sector. This video can not be played Nissan has confirmed it will build two new cars at its Sunderland plant. But he added: ""We need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained - namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU."" Figures released by the SMMT,externalon Thursday showed the UK's car industry is performing strongly, with almost 1.3 million vehicles produced in the nine months to September - a 10.5% increase on the same period last year. Just over one million vehicles were produced for export markets.

US threat on Russia missiles,"Kay Bailey Hutchison said the US wanted to find a diplomatic solution to this problem The threat from a senior US diplomat to ""take out"" Russian missiles that Washington believes are in breach of an important Cold War arms control treaty looks set to cause additional tensions with Moscow, just ahead of a meeting of Nato defence ministers that opens in Brussels on Wednesday. The US ambassador to Nato, Kay Bailey Hutchison, was speaking ahead of that meeting and brought up once again Washington's contention that Russia is in breach of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement of 1987. This treaty banned a whole category of weapons: ground-launched medium-range missiles, capable of striking targets at distances between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,100 miles). Russia denies breaking missile treaty Syria crisis: Russian Caspian missiles 'fell in Iran' Now, the Americans insist, despite Russian denials, that Moscow has a new medium-range missile in its inventory - the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8. This would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 Ambassador Hutchison said the US wants to find a diplomatic solution to this problem. But she appeared to indicate that the US might consider military action if Russia's development of the system continued. ""At that point we would be looking at the capability to take out a (Russian) missile that could hit any of our countries,"" she said, adding counter-measures (by the US) would be to take out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation of the treaty. ""They are on notice."" At first sight, this seems to be a fairly blunt warning from President Donald Trump's Nato ambassador. But it is not exactly clear what she is saying. Is she threatening a pre-emptive strike out of the blue? Surely not. Is she warning that if the Russian development of these weapons goes ahead then the US will find systems to target them in the event of a crisis? Indeed, other US experts have sometimes suggested that a more likely US response might be to throw over the INF treaty itself and deploy a similar category of weapon. That would be very bad news for arms control. Back in the Cold War, the US was alarmed at the then Soviet Union's deployment of the SS-20 system. Some of Washington's allies agreed to receive US Pershing and Cruise missiles in response. The move prompted widespread protests and huge political tensions. The resulting INF treaty swept this whole category of weapon away and significantly reduced tensions. Mr Putin and ex-President Barack Obama had diplomatic run-ins over the INF Treaty But now, once again, the INF Treaty is back in the news. Russia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. It has not answered any of the Nato countries' concerns. Indeed, in his pre-ministerial press conference, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted that ""the most plausible assessment would be that Russia is in violation of the treaty"". ""It is therefore urgent,"" he went on, ""that Russia addresses these concerns in a substantial and transparent manner."" He also added that, according to US intelligence, Russia had started to deploy the new missile. This video can not be played The Russian defence ministry released video it said shows missiles being launched Exactly what the Americans know is still not clear. For a long time experts were not even certain which specific missile was being talked about. Is this just an extended range version of the Iskander-M - an existing Russian weapon? Or could it be a new variant of the sea-launched Kalibr land attack missile that has been used by the Russian navy against targets in Syria? Whatever the details, the US insists the Russians are in breach of the INF agreement. That matters. Ambassador Hutchison may have spoken a little loosely. Russia's foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said: ""It seems that people who make such statements do not realise the level of their responsibility and the danger of aggressive rhetoric."" But if the deployment of the weapon continues, then the US could well make some equivalent move in response. The issue is bound to be high on the agenda when Nato defence ministers meet in Brussels.

How Sunderland defied Nissan,"This video can not be played Nissan boss: 10% tariffs would be 'handicap' for Sunderland plant When Carlos Ghosn made his not-very-veiled threat about the future of the giant Nissan plant in Sunderland last week, he might have thought locals would have quailed and rallied to his cause. He has longer to wait. People in Sunderland don't always do as they are told; before the vote on Britain's membership of the European Union, the Nissan chief executive urged people to vote to remain, stressing the advantages to Nissan, the region's biggest employer, of staying in the single market. They ignored him, with just under two-thirds of the Sunderland electorate voting to leave. Paul Watson, Labour and Co-operative leader of the city council since 2008, says people value Nissan's contribution to the local economy - it is the region's largest employer, providing work for 7,000 people - but that Sunderland is used to the vagaries of the world economy having big effects at home. The coal industry here powered the empire, employing hundreds of thousands to work the Durham field in scores of pits. Sunderland Bridge and Lambton coal drops on the River Wear, circa 1880. The industry still shapes the local culture; Washington, the new town beside the Nissan plant, remains in reality an amalgamation of about a dozen pit villages, where people still identify with their immediate area rather than the wider north east. When the pits closed in the 1980s - a victim of high costs relative to imported coal and a protracted battle for supremacy between mining unions and the Thatcher government - people learned the hard way that the tide of global commerce can go out quickly. In Washington, they do not bemoan the loss of the pits themselves, as they brought their own horrible legacy of occupational diseases, but they rue the lack of something to replace them. Shipbuilding was Sunderland's other great loss. At one stage the River Wear, which divides the city, could boast that it accounted for one-quarter of the world's new ships. Only 50 years ago it was still an international force, but now there are few signs the industry ever existed. Mr Watson says the real dark days for Sunderland - the 1980s, when the town reeled under the combined closures of pits and shipyards - are now behind it. The economy has been reinvented, with call centres, Nissan and now a burgeoning tech scene picking up the slack. ""The big monolithic industries have gone,"" said Mr Watson, who once worked in a shipyard, ""but other things have come in. It is about having a strategy, and our strategy is simply to make Sunderland prosperous."" At Sunderland Software City, a tech hub that would not be out of place in London's Silicon Roundabout, part of that vision is coming true. There are special effects firms, web designers and games makers. David Van der Velde, managing director of Consult and Design, a digital agency based in the centre, says people in the North East have a natural inventiveness that lends itself to technology companies. ""Sunderland has always been a place where people make things, people are inventive. We've moved from making things out of steel to making things out of software, but we're still making things"" The looming Brexit headache for Nissan Nissan: 10% tariffs would be 'handicap' Video, 00:00:50Nissan: 10% tariffs would be 'handicap' Hammond: Austerity isn't over New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

US governor in racism row refuses to quit,"This video can not be played Governor Northam: I am not the person in that photo Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has denied he was in a racist photo that appeared in his 1984 student yearbook page after initially apologising for it. Mr Northam, a Democrat, said he recognised that people would find this ""hard to believe"". He also admitted blackening his face to impersonate singer Michael Jackson at an event in the same year. Top US Democrats have called on him to resign. But he says he will stay on. The picture showed a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. Racist vandals hit historic Virginia school Note to Virginia waitress: We don't tip black people 'The blackface scandal that rocked my campus' Former Vice-President Joe Biden said Mr Northam had lost all moral authority. Black politicians in Virginia called it ""disgusting"" and Republicans also urged him to resign. He saidhe had initially taken responsibility for the photo, which he described as ""clearly racist and offensive"". But he said that on reflection with his family and friends he had concluded that he was neither of the people in the photo. ""It has taken time to make sure that it's not me but I'm convinced I'm not on that photo,"" he said. He said that he had however blackened his face at a dance contest in San Antonio. ""It is because my memory of that is so vivid that I do not believe I am in the photo in the yearbook,"" he said. Mr Northam said he was not asking for forgiveness for his past actions but for ""the opportunity to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that the person I was then is not the person I am today"". The statement on Saturday came after he said on Friday that he was ""deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now"". Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper tweeted a picture of the page which it said it obtained from the medical school library. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Superb England stun Ireland in Dublin,"This video can not be played Six Nations: England beat Grand Slam champions Ireland 32-20 Six Nations Ireland:(10) 20 Tries:Healy, CooneyPens:Sexton (2)Cons:Sexton (2) England:(17) 32 Tries:May, Daly, Slade (2)Pens:Farrell (2)Cons:Farrell (3) England pulled off arguably the most impressive victory of the Eddie Jones era as they ran in four tries to inflict Ireland's first Six Nations defeat in Dublin in six years. England had led 17-10 at half-time with tries from Jonny May and the impressive Elliot Daly separated by Cian Healy's burrowing score from close in, and could have been further ahead. And with their defence outstanding, their tactical kicking precise and the back three rock-solid under the high ball, they added two more opportunistic tries in the second period through the livewire Henry Slade. Ireland had seen off world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten autumn but their dream of consecutive Grand Slams came crashing down under a thunderous English assault. Johnny Sexton was subdued as an attacking force, his pass being picked off for Slade's second score, England a side transformed with the return of the bullocking Vunipola brothers and Manu Tuilagi. John Cooney's late try for Joe Schmidt's men did little to dampen the pain of a defeat that will jolt Irish confidence as the World Cup in Japan looms into view. For Jones it kick-starts beautifully the biggest year of his long career, this only England's second Six Nations win in Dublin since 2003, the sort of scalp that will bring belief back to those who had wondered if his team had flatlined. England 'nowhere near our best' - Jones Itoje suffers knee injury in England win 'England back with a bang in Ireland' Ireland must learn from 'reality check' Relive Ireland v England live coverage This video can not be played Six Nations Shuffle: Howlers, hat-tricks, freezing temperatures & epic comebacks It had been eight years since England's last Six Nations try in Dublin but they had to wait just 95 seconds more as Farrell struck first in his battle with opposite number Sexton. After muscular carries into the Irish 22 from Tuilagi and Billy Vunipola England went left, and it was Farrell's fast, flat cut-out pass that put Daly in space to draw the last man and send May over in the corner. Farrell landed the conversion from the touchline before Sexton's penalty brought a frantic contest back to 7-3, and on a freezing Dublin afternoon the men in green then turned up the heat. England survived the sin-binning of 20-year-old flanker Tom Curry after his late hit on Keith Earls but could not hold out when Sexton kicked a penalty to the corner and Healy hammered over from a yard out. But they struck back again when Daly's grubber kick through was juggled and spilt by Jacob Stockdale under pressure from Jack Nowell, Daly diving on the loose ball for the score and Farrell stroking over the conversion. England's fly-half then struck a perfect penalty from out wide again after Mako Vunipola had been correctly denied a try for a double movement for a seven-point lead at the interval. Prop Mako Vunipola led from the front with 23 tackles as England's pack stood up to Ireland's forwards Ireland had not conceded as many first-half points in a Six Nations match in Dublin for 13 years, and had lost the last 20 games in which they were more than a point behind at half-time. But after England failed to work a drop-goal after a long spell deep in Irish territory, Ulster's Stockdale hacked long, Kyle Sinckler was penalised for a late tackle on Garry Ringrose and Sexton reduced the margin to just four points. With England lock Maro Itoje off injured the belief started to swell among the home support, the roars growing louder as Farrell missed a penalty - conceded by Sexton for hands in the ruck - that by his standards was straightforward. Both sides freshened up their packs as the minutes ticked away and the tension grew. And it was England who struck the pivotal blow with a fine move at pace from a scrum inside their own half. Ben Youngs ran left, Slade threw a miss-pass out to May on the touchline and ran on to gather the winger's clever kick ahead to dive on the ball for England's third try. Farrell again tugged the conversion wide but banged over a penalty moments later after replacement Courtney Lawes's big hit in midfield, and with the scoreboard showing 25-13 with less than 10 minutes left the choruses of England fans' anthem Swing Low began to sound. Slade spotted Sexton's desperate pass in his own 22 and gathered brilliantly to slide over for his second try, and English celebrations could begin. With only one more away match to come in this championship, a humdinger in Cardiff at the end of the month in round three, England at last have the momentum that had slipped away during a testing, turbulent 2018. This video can not be played Eddie Jones delighted with 'top of the class' Mako Vunipola The beating heart of England's relentless defence, an all-encompassing performance from a prop whose absence through injury England had keenly felt. Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 live:""If there was one team who was going to bloom in the last 20 minutes, you'd have thought it would be Ireland. ""But Ireland couldn't get out of their 22 and England capitalised. When you win in Dublin against the second-best team in the world, you are going to be flying for the rest of the tournament."" Former Ireland winger Denis Hickie:""I don't think Ireland have been overconfident. They will be very hard on themselves after that game.

Superb England stun Ireland in DublinEngland produce a superb performance to beat Grand Slam champions Ireland 32-20 in a brutal Six Nations encounter in Dublin.,"This video can not be played Six Nations: England beat Grand Slam champions Ireland 32-20 Six Nations Ireland:(10) 20 Tries:Healy, CooneyPens:Sexton (2)Cons:Sexton (2) England:(17) 32 Tries:May, Daly, Slade (2)Pens:Farrell (2)Cons:Farrell (3) England pulled off arguably the most impressive victory of the Eddie Jones era as they ran in four tries to inflict Ireland's first Six Nations defeat in Dublin in six years. England had led 17-10 at half-time with tries from Jonny May and the impressive Elliot Daly separated by Cian Healy's burrowing score from close in, and could have been further ahead. And with their defence outstanding, their tactical kicking precise and the back three rock-solid under the high ball, they added two more opportunistic tries in the second period through the livewire Henry Slade. Ireland had seen off world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten autumn but their dream of consecutive Grand Slams came crashing down under a thunderous English assault. Johnny Sexton was subdued as an attacking force, his pass being picked off for Slade's second score, England a side transformed with the return of the bullocking Vunipola brothers and Manu Tuilagi. John Cooney's late try for Joe Schmidt's men did little to dampen the pain of a defeat that will jolt Irish confidence as the World Cup in Japan looms into view. For Jones it kick-starts beautifully the biggest year of his long career, this only England's second Six Nations win in Dublin since 2003, the sort of scalp that will bring belief back to those who had wondered if his team had flatlined. England 'nowhere near our best' - Jones Itoje suffers knee injury in England win 'England back with a bang in Ireland' Ireland must learn from 'reality check' Relive Ireland v England live coverage This video can not be played Six Nations Shuffle: Howlers, hat-tricks, freezing temperatures & epic comebacks It had been eight years since England's last Six Nations try in Dublin but they had to wait just 95 seconds more as Farrell struck first in his battle with opposite number Sexton. After muscular carries into the Irish 22 from Tuilagi and Billy Vunipola England went left, and it was Farrell's fast, flat cut-out pass that put Daly in space to draw the last man and send May over in the corner. Farrell landed the conversion from the touchline before Sexton's penalty brought a frantic contest back to 7-3, and on a freezing Dublin afternoon the men in green then turned up the heat. England survived the sin-binning of 20-year-old flanker Tom Curry after his late hit on Keith Earls but could not hold out when Sexton kicked a penalty to the corner and Healy hammered over from a yard out. But they struck back again when Daly's grubber kick through was juggled and spilt by Jacob Stockdale under pressure from Jack Nowell, Daly diving on the loose ball for the score and Farrell stroking over the conversion. England's fly-half then struck a perfect penalty from out wide again after Mako Vunipola had been correctly denied a try for a double movement for a seven-point lead at the interval. Prop Mako Vunipola led from the front with 23 tackles as England's pack stood up to Ireland's forwards Ireland had not conceded as many first-half points in a Six Nations match in Dublin for 13 years, and had lost the last 20 games in which they were more than a point behind at half-time. But after England failed to work a drop-goal after a long spell deep in Irish territory, Ulster's Stockdale hacked long, Kyle Sinckler was penalised for a late tackle on Garry Ringrose and Sexton reduced the margin to just four points. With England lock Maro Itoje off injured the belief started to swell among the home support, the roars growing louder as Farrell missed a penalty - conceded by Sexton for hands in the ruck - that by his standards was straightforward. Both sides freshened up their packs as the minutes ticked away and the tension grew. And it was England who struck the pivotal blow with a fine move at pace from a scrum inside their own half. Ben Youngs ran left, Slade threw a miss-pass out to May on the touchline and ran on to gather the winger's clever kick ahead to dive on the ball for England's third try. Farrell again tugged the conversion wide but banged over a penalty moments later after replacement Courtney Lawes's big hit in midfield, and with the scoreboard showing 25-13 with less than 10 minutes left the choruses of England fans' anthem Swing Low began to sound. Slade spotted Sexton's desperate pass in his own 22 and gathered brilliantly to slide over for his second try, and English celebrations could begin. With only one more away match to come in this championship, a humdinger in Cardiff at the end of the month in round three, England at last have the momentum that had slipped away during a testing, turbulent 2018. This video can not be played Eddie Jones delighted with 'top of the class' Mako Vunipola The beating heart of England's relentless defence, an all-encompassing performance from a prop whose absence through injury England had keenly felt. Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 live:""If there was one team who was going to bloom in the last 20 minutes, you'd have thought it would be Ireland. ""But Ireland couldn't get out of their 22 and England capitalised. When you win in Dublin against the second-best team in the world, you are going to be flying for the rest of the tournament."" Former Ireland winger Denis Hickie:""I don't think Ireland have been overconfident. They will be very hard on themselves after that game.

"Nissan to 'pull' making new model in UKA Sunderland MP described the suggestion as ""deeply troubling"".Tyne & Wear","The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan is expected to announce that it is cancelling a planned investment at its plant in Sunderland. In 2016 the car maker said it would build the new model of its X-Trail SUV in the UK after receiving ""assurances"" from the government over Brexit. The Japanese company is expected to say investment will be now be pulled, rather than existing work being halted. Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, spoke of her concern at the prospect. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy,"" she tweeted. ""So many jobs and livelihoods depend on Nissan's success."" Labour Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott suggested there was an ""inevitable role that Brexit plays here.... None of it is conducive to encouraging business investment in this country"". ""I will be doing everything I can to protect the jobs at the Sunderland plant. I will be asking for the government to intervene, and will stay in close contact with the company itself,"" she said in aTwitter post,external. Nissan has produced cars at Sunderland since 1986 and employs almost 7,000 people. Nissanannounced in October 2016it would build the next-generation X-Trail and Qashqai at Sunderland. Production of the Qashqai - the best-selling crossover vehicle in Europe - makes up the majority of the current work at Sunderland and is not expected to be affected by the announcement on the X-Trail. BBC business reporter Rob Young said: ""The reasons for the investment cancellation are not known, but the industry as a whole has been warning Brexit uncertainty might hit investment."" Our correspondent said as the announcement was expected to be about planned future investment, the impact on Nissan's current workforce may be very minimal. Nissan refused to shed light on the situation. A spokesman said it ""does not comment on rumour or speculation"". There had been concerns that Nissan - part-owned by France's Renault - could move production to France in future to avoid any post-Brexit EU tariffs. But when the X-Trail investment was initially announced, Nissan said hundreds of jobs would be created at the Sunderland plant. It sparked questions over whether a deal between the car-maker and the government had been struck although ministers insisted that no ""financial compensation"" had been offered. Peter Campbell, the motor industry correspondent at the Financial Times, said the fall in demand for diesels would appear to be one of the main factors in the announcement as Nissan was planning to make mainly diesel versions of the X-Trail in Sunderland. He told the BBC: ""If Nissan decided to make those cars in petrol it would have to ship engines over from Japan and the cost of doing that work against the decision to build it in the UK."" He added: ""There are obviously other factors - car sales are down in the UK, they have fallen across Europe...  and there is obviously the overhang of Brexit and the worries of the impact that might have on a plant that exports about 80% of its vehicles.""

French marchers condemn police violence,"This video can not be played During the latest protests on Saturday scuffles broke out at Place de la RÃ©publique in Paris France's ""yellow-vest"" protesters are staging another round of demonstrations against the cost of living and President Emmanuel Macron's policies. This week they are focusing on the police's use of rubber bullets. Dozens of people have been injured since the weekly protests started in November. Several have lost eyes. A leading figure in the movement, JÃ©rÃ´me Rodrigues, addressed the crowd a week after suffering a serious eye injury during a protest in Paris. ""They shoot at the population with a weapon of war,"" he said. ""Is that what France is like today? We just want to fill the fridge and we end up losing an eye."" Much of the protesters' anger has been directed at the use of anti-riot LBD launchers - also known as ""flash-balls"". Officials have admitted that these were fired near the site where Mr Rodrigues was hit, but said the link with his injury was not clear. Police have issued guidance this week to aim the non-lethal LBD riot gun away from the head A French court ruled on Friday that police could continue using the guns because of the threat of violence. Peaceful rallies have sometimes ended in vandalism and 1,000 police officers have been among those wounded. At least 10 deaths have been linked to the unrest. Thousands of people are taking part in Saturday's round of marches in towns and cities across France. A Facebook page set up by the organisers said they wanted to an end to the government's ""disproportionate use of force designed to silence the protesters"". Vocal 'Gilet jaune' member JÃ©rÃ´me Rodrigues addressed a crowd a week after being hit in the eye At a ""great march of the wounded"" in Paris, healthy protesters wore eye patches in solidarity. Mr Rodrigues, a 39-year-old former salesman who is training to become a plumber, told the BBC: ""Today's protest is a special protest. It's organised by the injured and for the injured."" In the northern city of Lille one protester carried a banner reading: ""Cease fire. Have you gone crazy?"" Sporadic clashes have been reported. Police fired tear gas on the Place de la Republique, a frequent focus of unrest in Paris. Two protesters were detained in the western town of Morlaix. The LBD40 is described as a non-lethal weapon which replaced the old ""flash-ball"" in France. But the old name is still widely used. It shoots 40mm (1.6in) rubber or foam pellets at a speed of up to 100m per second and is not meant to break the skin. But many of those hit have suffered terrible injuries. Will Macron's Grand Debate tackle yellow-vest crisis? France sees ninth round of protests Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Protester Olivier BÃ©ziade, 47, was shot in the temple by a riot gun on 12 January in Bordeaux. Video at the time caught him running from police and then collapsing in the street, his face covered in blood. Olivier BÃ©ziade was critically wounded on 12 January in Bordeaux and only emerged from a coma on Friday He was one of five seriously wounded on that day alone. Campaigners say a dozen people have lost an eye, although the details have not been corroborated. A lawyer for some of the victims, Ãtienne NoÃ«l, said police did not have sufficient training in using the guns and many victims had been hit in the head. Few European countries use similar anti-riot weapons, but last monththe European Court of Human Rights rejected a move to ban them,external. The movement was born online and has no overall leader or organisation. Supporters have turned up at marches and roadblocks every Saturday since 17 November. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The ""gilets jaunes"" derive their name from the high-visibility vests they wear - and which French motorists are required by law to carry in their vehicles. They initially came together to demonstrate against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, which they say hurt those who live in remote areas and depend on cars. But since their first marches - and the government's subsequent U-turn on fuel taxes - their demands have expanded to boosting people's purchasing power and allowing popular referendums. Most ""gilets jaunes"" live on low to medium incomes. They range from factory workers, mid-level employees to the self-employed (particularly artisans) and retired people.

"Ban phones in schools, says minister","Pupils should be banned from taking smartphones into school, the minister for school standards in England has told the BBC. Nick Gibb spoke out ahead of the government publishing new guidance for schools, expected to address internet safety, social media and online gaming. It is expected to say children should be taught to limit the amount of time they spend online. Schools have the power to ban phones from being taken on to the premises. But government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine whether this is appropriate. Patsy Kane, executive head teacher at the Education and Leadership Trust in Manchester, said Mr Gibb's plan was ""missing the point on just how fantastically useful mobile phones can be for learning."" She told BBC Breakfast her multi-academy trust encourages the responsible use of smartphones during lessons and that teachers do remove the devices if they are used inappropriately during school time. She added: ""There's a fantastic range of apps now for revision - and the students are really motivated to use them."" Should phones be allowed in schools? Ofsted chief inspector backs phones ban Schools 'should have consistent policy on phones' French MPs back mobile phone ban in schools The trade union that represents head teachers has expressed its scepticism about outright bans. But Mr Gibb said: ""Many schools have already taken the decision to ban mobile phones from the classroom. ""While this is clearly a matter for the head teacher, my own view is that schools should ban their pupils from bringing smartphones into school or the classroom."" Katie Ivens, of the Campaign for Real Education, said she supported a classroom ban but that pupils should be allowed to carry phones to and from school for safety. What is known as ""relationships education"" is to become compulsory from September 2020, with schools being encouraged to teach it from September of this year. Last summer, the governmentpublished draft guidance,externalabout how this could be implemented. ""Children and young people are growing up in an increasingly complex world and living their lives seamlessly on and offline,"" it said. But it acknowledged that while this presented ""many positive and exciting opportunities"" there were also ""challenges and risks"". Since the publication of the document, which said ""pupils should be taught about the benefits of balancing time spent on and offline"", there have been more than 11,000 responses to it and new guidance is expected soon. ""Children should not be spending hours and hours on their smartphones or iPads. There are obviously huge benefits to the internet and there's nothing intrinsically damaging about spending time online,"" Mr Gibb said. ""But if the time children spend using social media or playing computer games becomes excessive, it drives out time for them to talk to their parents, exercise, do their homework or play with friends. ""It eats into the amount of sleep and rest children have, resulting in their coming into school the next day tired and unable to concentrate."" The minister, who has spent more than six years at the Department for Education, added: ""Ensuring children can regulate their own use of smartphones and social media is becoming an increasingly important life skill for them to learn."" But the NAHT union, which represents school leaders, has said banning pupils from taking a mobile phone to school can be counterproductive. Giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee in October last year, the union's senior policy adviser Sarah Hannafin said: ""Mobile phone bans certainly work for some schools but there isn't one policy that will work for all schools. ""Outright banning mobile phones can cause more problems than it solves, driving phone use 'underground' and making problems less visible and obvious for schools to tackle."" She added: ""Ultimately, schools work to prepare young people for the outside world, giving them the awareness and strategies to responsibly monitor their own screen use and the ability to identify and deal with any negative impacts or problematic content they encounter.""

US governor urged to quit over racist photo,"This video can not be played Governor Northam: I am not the person in that photo Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has denied he was in a racist photo that appeared in his 1984 student yearbook page after initially apologising for it. Mr Northam, a Democrat, said he recognised that people would find this ""hard to believe"". He also admitted blackening his face to impersonate singer Michael Jackson at an event in the same year. Top US Democrats have called on him to resign. But he says he will stay on. The picture showed a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. Racist vandals hit historic Virginia school Note to Virginia waitress: We don't tip black people 'The blackface scandal that rocked my campus' Former Vice-President Joe Biden said Mr Northam had lost all moral authority. Black politicians in Virginia called it ""disgusting"" and Republicans also urged him to resign. He saidhe had initially taken responsibility for the photo, which he described as ""clearly racist and offensive"". But he said that on reflection with his family and friends he had concluded that he was neither of the people in the photo. ""It has taken time to make sure that it's not me but I'm convinced I'm not on that photo,"" he said. He said that he had however blackened his face at a dance contest in San Antonio. ""It is because my memory of that is so vivid that I do not believe I am in the photo in the yearbook,"" he said. Mr Northam said he was not asking for forgiveness for his past actions but for ""the opportunity to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that the person I was then is not the person I am today"". The statement on Saturday came after he said on Friday that he was ""deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now"". Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper tweeted a picture of the page which it said it obtained from the medical school library. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The mistake that led to a ÃÂ£1.2bn business,"Kristo Kaarmann initially wondered whether anyone would trust a website ""set up by two Estonian dudes"" The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Kristo Kaarmann, co-founder and chief executive of money transfer business TransferWise. When Kristo Kaarmann was kicking himself for being ""incredibly stupid"", little did he know that it would spark an idea for a business that is now estimated to be worth more than Â£1.2bn. Back in 2008, the then 28-year-old Estonian was working in London as a management consultant when he got a very chunky Christmas bonus of Â£10,000. As interest rates were higher back in Estonia, he decided that he'd transfer the money from his UK current account to his Estonian savings account, so as to earn more from the cash. The company has its second largest office in Tallinn, the Estonian capital ""So I paid my UK bank a Â£15 fee, and transferred the Â£10,000, and then a week later I saw that Â£500 less than I had expected had arrived in the Estonian account,"" says Kristo, now 38. ""I started digging to find out what had happened, and I realised that I had been incredibly stupid. ""I had foolishly expected that my UK bank would have given me the exchange rate I saw when I looked on [news wires] Reuters and Bloomberg. ""Instead the bank had used an exchange rate 5% less favourable, which is how it and all the other banks get their cut. It was my mistake."" Annoyed with himself, Kristo vowed to come up with a way of transferring money overseas that removed banks from the process. Initially this involved just him and his Estonian friend Taavet Hinrikus, who was then director at telecommunications firm Skype, informally transferring money between themselves. Kristo says that he and Taavet share the leadership work It worked because Kristo often wanted to swap pounds sterling for kroons, the Estonian currency at the time, and vice versa for Taavet. They simply picked whatever was the mid-market exchange rate - the average exchange rate on any given day. Soon they had built up a network of Estonian friends - both expats and those back in Estonia - who were all doing the same thing, and Kristo and Taavet realised they could make a business out of it. So in 2011 they launched London-based TransferWise, a financial technology or ""fintech"" website that allows users to transfer money overseas to a different currency at the mid-market rate for a set fee of 0.5%. Today, TransferWise is a global business, and investors include Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. For the first year, Kristo and Taavet grew the business organically, relying on their savings. Customers first arrived in a trickle thanks to word-of-mouth, but then rose sharply after a positive review on a technology website. Kristo motorcyles in Africa every year over Christmas and New Year To avoid any legal problems, Kristo and Taavet had secured clearance and licences from the UK's then regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, before they launched. ""It was the first time they had ever seen anything like us,"" says Kristo. ""But they saw enough that they weren't worried that we would be doing anything shady."" In early 2012 Kristo and Taavet started to look for their first investors, but initially struggled to secure any. ""We talked to maybe 15 investors in total, but they all turned us down,"" says Kristo. ""No-one in Europe would touch us - European investors back then were far more risk averse than American ones. ""So we took our first funding from a small fund in New York called IA Ventures."" Sir Richard Branson invested in TransferWise in 2014 As TransferWise then steadily grew, other investors followed. It has now raised Â£305m in total. Meanwhile, its website and app have been used by more than four million people, and are available in 50 countries and 49 currencies. The company says that Â£3bn is now transferred via its service every month. MoreThe Bossfeatures: The eyewear designer for the stars 'Our vision is never to lay anyone off' Smashing through barriers to set up a $2bn tech firm How one man's eureka moment earns Disney $3bn a year With a second big office in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, and eight others in locations such as Tampa Bay, Budapest and Tokyo, TransferWise saw its revenues rise 75% to Â£117m in the year to the end of March 2018. Its annual profit remained flat at Â£6.2m. Prior to March 2017, the company had always reported a loss, as funds were put into its expansion. It now has 1,400 employees. Fintech author and commentator Chris Skinner says that TransferWise grew so quickly because it was cheap for people to use, and there were no hidden fees. The company has 10 offices around the world ""Add to this some major heavyweights investing in and backing the business, and you have a potential success on your hands,"" he says. ""I say potential though, as even with a good idea, good marketing, good investors and good backing, nothing is guaranteed in this world. ""However, along with Monzo, Starling, Revolut and a number of other UK fintech start-ups, TransferWise is a standout from the crowd and is transforming financial services by targeting great customer experience at the lowest cost through technology."" While Kristo has the chief executive title, he says that he and co-founder Taavet, 37, have ""from the beginning both been involved in everything. We are very overlapping in what we do."" When not working, Kristo likes to relax by kite surfing, and every Christmas and New Year he goes long-distance motorcycling in Africa with his brother. ""There were lots of unknowns when we started,"" he says. ""Would anyone trust this website set up by two Estonian dudes? Would anyone else have this problem that we wanted to solve?

"My happy, healthy son changed overnight","This video can not be played 'Overnight, something went very wrong' A mother is calling for greater awareness of a little-known condition she believes changed her easy-going son overnight. Alison Maclaine fears some children are being misdiagnosed with autism and mental health issues when they are really suffering an infection which can be treated simply with antibiotics. Her eight-year-old son Jack suffered distressing personality changes and ""lost a year of his life"". And she said she was left ""in despair"" that she and her family had ""no quality of life"". Now Alison believes he was suffering from Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANDAS), triggered by a streptococcal infection - a condition that can be treated with simple antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. Jack went to bed one Friday in January last year, looking forward to a football tournament he was playing in the next day. But on arrival at the venue on Saturday morning he became overwhelmed with anxiety. After several attempts, he was unable to enter the building. At home in Dumfries, Alison realised something was very wrong. She told the BBC: ""He started to repeatedly apologise. He said he didn't deserve to have fun, didn't deserve to have friends, didn't deserve to have nice things, didn't deserve to play football. Alison Maclaine knew her son's diagnosis was not right and did her own research into his symptoms ""That eventually led to 'I don't deserve to live, when I get home I am just going to sit outside until I freeze to death'."" When it came to bedtime, Jack refused to have covers and pillows and started to repeat that he needed to die, until he fell asleep. The following day saw his behaviour sink further. Alison said: ""One of the worst things in the world must be listening to your child telling you he wanted to die and asking you to help him."" According to the charity PANS PANDAS UK, PANS (Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) is a neuropsychiatric condition which is triggered by a misdirected immune response which results in an inflammation of a child's brain. PANDAS is a subset of PANS, triggered by a misdirected immune response to a streptococcal infection which results in an inflammation of a child's brain. Happening very quickly, this can cause a child to exhibit symptoms including anxiety, aggressive behaviour, depression, clumsiness, insomnia and the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was first recognised in the United States in 1998 where PANS PANDAS charities estimate as many as one in 200 children could be affected. In 2018, the World Health Organisation recognised the condition, but in the UK it is not widely known. There is no clear test for the condition so doctors often have to rule out psychiatric conditions. The immediate response to antibiotic or anti-inflammatory treatment is often what confirms the condition. The charity PANS PANDAS UK said a failure to understand the condition in the UK means that children are regularly wrongly referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Jack then became aggressive and withdrew from his beloved younger sister Cara. He would become irritable and angry and started to regress, playing with baby toys. Over the next several months he was repeatedly diagnosed as having autism and severe anxiety. But Alison, herself a psychiatrist, disagreed. She said: ""It got to the point where I really felt absolute despair. ""I felt that he had no quality of life, we had no quality of life. There were times when I contemplated things."" His family feels that Jack is ""back"" That despair led to Alison doing her own research and the discovery of PANS and PANDAS. Alison said reading the symptoms was like reading a description of her son and his behavioural changes. Jack was finally diagnosed privately by a consultant paediatrician in England and treated with simple antibiotics. They worked overnight and Alison had her son back. She said: ""Jack responded dramatically to the treatment. He hadn't left the street in five months except for school. After two days on antibiotics he wanted to come to Morrisons with me and Cara.  It felt like Jack was back."" Dr Tim Ubhi finally diagnosed PANDAS in Jack Alison is frustrated now, believing if Jack had been given got antibiotics when he first presented to the GP in January, the outcome would have been different. She said: ""It is so frustrating knowing the treatment was so simple. Now I hate to think there are other children in the situation that they have this disorder that has not been picked up on and have been sent down a mental health/psychological route which can't fix the problem."" Dr Tim Ubhi, who diagnosed Jack's condition, said: ""The problem here is if we do not recognise this condition and we ignore it, potentially there are children out there who are suffering who could actually get treated and actually improve their symptoms. ""So we have a responsibility as physicians to think about this as a condition and do the work to actually create an awareness of what the condition is doing in the UK."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We appreciate that watching any loved one suffer is heartbreaking, even more so when it is a child. ""We are working together with partners to improve the outcomes and support for adults and children with rare conditions, and ensure that everyone receives the appropriate treatment. ""Ministers are unable to make or influence clinical decisions or definitions, and it would not be appropriate for them to do so."" If you, or someone you know, have been affected by mental health issues,these organisationsmay be able to help.

Chariot burial finds ruled as treasure,"This terret ring would have guided the chariot reins Parts of an Iron Age chariot found by a metal detectorist have been declared treasure by the Pembrokeshire coroner. Mike Smith made the discovery in February 2018 on farmland in the south of the county. The court at Milford Haven heard on Thursday the finds were part of the ritual burial of an entire chariot and that the site is now legally protected. Mr Smith says the 2,000-year-old finds could be worth a ""life-changing"" six to seven figure sum. The nine artefacts are now Crown property and a independent valuation committee will decide on the payment to Mr Smith. That will be shared fifty-fifty between Mr Smith and the landowner. Mike Smith expects to receive a 'life-changing' payment for his finds ""It's guess work,"" said Mr Smith after the inquest. ""But you're definitely talking six or seven figures. ""It's the biggest ever metal detecting find, as in there's never been a chariot ever discovered by a metal detectorist. There've been hoards found, but never anything like this."" He now hopes he can afford to buy a bungalow for himself and his wife who has difficulty climbing stairs. ""I still can't believe it. Obviously I've read other people's finds. I've watched them on telly, and I've always thought, I wouldn't mind finding that, it's still surreal, and life-changing,"" said Mr Smith who has been metal detecting since 1977. National Museum Wales said it will try to acquire the treasure ""for the national collection and on behalf of the people of Wales"". Mike Smith first thought this bridle decoration was a medieval brooch It was a chance find after the weather forced Mr Smith's to switch to another field. When an expert told him it was a Celtic harness decoration and not a medieval brooch, he realised there might be more. Mr Smith, from Milford Haven said: ""It's very difficult to describe, you know it when you see it, and you know it's special."" He thought immediately that the artefacts pointed to the site of a traditional burial, usually reserved for high-ranking tribe members who would be interred complete with their chariot, horses, tack and weapons. ""The chariot's definitely thereâ¦ and the body's in itâ¦ It's the first one found outside of Yorkshire,"" he said. Unearthing hidden treasures Heat wave reveals ancient Welsh sites DIY remote control detector's jackpot,external Last summer he helped archaeologists carry out an initial dig which revealed more parts. The undisclosed site was then covered up again and scheduled as an ancient monument. The tops of a pair of wheels revealed by the trial excavation The finds were identified and dated to probably AD 25-75 by curators and museum archaeologists at National Museum Wales by comparing them with others already known across Britain. Red glass was made and allowed to cool into shaped recesses in the bronze surfaces, creating distinctive and vibrant flowing designs. Gwilym Hughes, head of Cadw said: ""The objects demonstrate imaginative and clever craftsmanship, reflecting an inner world of colour and beauty."" The Celtic designs known as late La TÃ¨ne art are the first to be discovered in Pembrokeshire The museum's principal curator of prehistoric archaeology, Adam Gwilt, said: ""These chariot pieces may have been witness to some of the historical events of the time, as Iron Age peoples defended their ways of life and identities, in the face of an expanding Roman empire."" The museum now hopes it has the funding for a full excavation in the Spring. ""Something like this takes a lot of organisation and funding as well so we've been working with  a number of partners to put together what's needed to do a continuing investigation,"" he said. It is expected that more treasure inquests will be needed when the new dig gets underway and Mr Smith would still have a claim to future finds.

Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener?,"The supermarket chain Morrisons is raising the price of its reusable plastic bags from 10p to 15p as a trial and introducing a 20p paper version. The paper bags will be available in eight stores as part of a two-month trial. The supermarket chain said reducing plastic was their customers' top environmental concern. Paper bags remain popular in the US, but they fell out of use in UK supermarkets in the 1970s as plastic was seen as a more durable material. But are paper bags more environmentally friendly than plastic ones? The answer comes down to: how much energy is used to make the bag during manufacturing? how durable is the bag? (i.e. how many times can it be reused?) how easy is it to recycle? how quickly does it decompose if thrown away? In 2011a research paper produced by the Northern Ireland Assembly,externalsaid it ""takes more than four times as much energy to manufacture a paper bag as it does to manufacture a plastic bag."" Unlike plastic bags (which the report says are produced from the waste products of oil refining) paper requires forests to be cut down to produce the bags. The manufacturing process, according to the research, also produces a higher concentration of toxic chemicals compared with making single-use plastic bags. Paper bags also weigh more than plastic; this means transportation requires more energy, adding to their carbon footprint, the study adds. Morrisons says that the material used to make its paper bags will be 100% sourced from forests that are managed responsibly. And if new forests are grown to replace lost trees, this will help to offset the climate change impact, because trees lock up carbon from the atmosphere. In 2006, the Environment Agency examined a range of bags made from different materials to find out how many times they need to be reused in order to have a lower global warming potential than a conventional single-use plastic bag. The studyfound paper bags needed to be reused at least three times, one fewer than plastic bags for life (four times),external. At the other end of the spectrum, the Environment Agency found that cotton bags required the most number of reuses, at 131. That was down to the high amount of energy used to produce and fertilise cotton yarn. Morrisons to trial 20p paper bags Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Reality Check: Where is the plastic waste mountain? But even if a paper bag requires the fewest reuses there is a practical consideration: will it last long enough to survive at least three trips to the supermarket? Paper bags are not as durable as bags for life, being more likely to split or tear, especially if they get wet. In its conclusion, the Environment Agency says ""it is unlikely the paper bag can be regularly reused the required number of times due to its low durability"". Morrisons insists there is no reason its paper bag cannot be reused as many times as the plastic one it is replacing, although it depends on how the bag is treated. Cotton bags, despite being the most carbon intensive to manufacture, are the most durable and will have a much longer life. Despite its low durability, one advantage of paper is that it decomposes much more quickly than plastic, and therefore it is less likely to be a source of litter and pose a risk to wildlife. Paper is also more widely recyclable, while plastic bags can take between 400 and 1,000 years to decompose. Paper bags require marginally fewer reuses than bags for life to make them more environmentally friendly than single-use plastic bags. On the other hand, paper bags are less durable than other types of bags. So if customers have to replace their paper ones more frequently, it will have a greater environmental effect. But the key to reducing the impact of all carrier bags - no matter what they are made of -  is to reuse them as much as possible, says Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at Northampton University. Many people forget to bring their reusable bags on their weekly supermarket trip, and end up having to buy more bags at the till, she says. This will have a much bigger environmental impact compared with just choosing to use paper, plastic or cotton. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

US governor urged to quit over racist photoVirginia's Ralph Northam appeared in a yearbook photo of a man in blackface and another in a KKK robe.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Governor Northam: I am not the person in that photo Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has denied he was in a racist photo that appeared in his 1984 student yearbook page after initially apologising for it. Mr Northam, a Democrat, said he recognised that people would find this ""hard to believe"". He also admitted blackening his face to impersonate singer Michael Jackson at an event in the same year. Top US Democrats have called on him to resign. But he says he will stay on. The picture showed a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. Racist vandals hit historic Virginia school Note to Virginia waitress: We don't tip black people 'The blackface scandal that rocked my campus' Former Vice-President Joe Biden said Mr Northam had lost all moral authority. Black politicians in Virginia called it ""disgusting"" and Republicans also urged him to resign. He saidhe had initially taken responsibility for the photo, which he described as ""clearly racist and offensive"". But he said that on reflection with his family and friends he had concluded that he was neither of the people in the photo. ""It has taken time to make sure that it's not me but I'm convinced I'm not on that photo,"" he said. He said that he had however blackened his face at a dance contest in San Antonio. ""It is because my memory of that is so vivid that I do not believe I am in the photo in the yearbook,"" he said. Mr Northam said he was not asking for forgiveness for his past actions but for ""the opportunity to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that the person I was then is not the person I am today"". The statement on Saturday came after he said on Friday that he was ""deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now"". Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper tweeted a picture of the page which it said it obtained from the medical school library. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"French marchers condemn police violenceThe latest ""yellow-vest"" protests focus on the use of riot guns that has led to serious injuries.Europe","This video can not be played During the latest protests on Saturday scuffles broke out at Place de la RÃ©publique in Paris France's ""yellow-vest"" protesters are staging another round of demonstrations against the cost of living and President Emmanuel Macron's policies. This week they are focusing on the police's use of rubber bullets. Dozens of people have been injured since the weekly protests started in November. Several have lost eyes. A leading figure in the movement, JÃ©rÃ´me Rodrigues, addressed the crowd a week after suffering a serious eye injury during a protest in Paris. ""They shoot at the population with a weapon of war,"" he said. ""Is that what France is like today? We just want to fill the fridge and we end up losing an eye."" Much of the protesters' anger has been directed at the use of anti-riot LBD launchers - also known as ""flash-balls"". Officials have admitted that these were fired near the site where Mr Rodrigues was hit, but said the link with his injury was not clear. Police have issued guidance this week to aim the non-lethal LBD riot gun away from the head A French court ruled on Friday that police could continue using the guns because of the threat of violence. Peaceful rallies have sometimes ended in vandalism and 1,000 police officers have been among those wounded. At least 10 deaths have been linked to the unrest. Thousands of people are taking part in Saturday's round of marches in towns and cities across France. A Facebook page set up by the organisers said they wanted to an end to the government's ""disproportionate use of force designed to silence the protesters"". Vocal 'Gilet jaune' member JÃ©rÃ´me Rodrigues addressed a crowd a week after being hit in the eye At a ""great march of the wounded"" in Paris, healthy protesters wore eye patches in solidarity. Mr Rodrigues, a 39-year-old former salesman who is training to become a plumber, told the BBC: ""Today's protest is a special protest. It's organised by the injured and for the injured."" In the northern city of Lille one protester carried a banner reading: ""Cease fire. Have you gone crazy?"" Sporadic clashes have been reported. Police fired tear gas on the Place de la Republique, a frequent focus of unrest in Paris. Two protesters were detained in the western town of Morlaix. The LBD40 is described as a non-lethal weapon which replaced the old ""flash-ball"" in France. But the old name is still widely used. It shoots 40mm (1.6in) rubber or foam pellets at a speed of up to 100m per second and is not meant to break the skin. But many of those hit have suffered terrible injuries. Will Macron's Grand Debate tackle yellow-vest crisis? France sees ninth round of protests Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Protester Olivier BÃ©ziade, 47, was shot in the temple by a riot gun on 12 January in Bordeaux. Video at the time caught him running from police and then collapsing in the street, his face covered in blood. Olivier BÃ©ziade was critically wounded on 12 January in Bordeaux and only emerged from a coma on Friday He was one of five seriously wounded on that day alone. Campaigners say a dozen people have lost an eye, although the details have not been corroborated. A lawyer for some of the victims, Ãtienne NoÃ«l, said police did not have sufficient training in using the guns and many victims had been hit in the head. Few European countries use similar anti-riot weapons, but last monththe European Court of Human Rights rejected a move to ban them,external. The movement was born online and has no overall leader or organisation. Supporters have turned up at marches and roadblocks every Saturday since 17 November. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The ""gilets jaunes"" derive their name from the high-visibility vests they wear - and which French motorists are required by law to carry in their vehicles. They initially came together to demonstrate against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, which they say hurt those who live in remote areas and depend on cars. But since their first marches - and the government's subsequent U-turn on fuel taxes - their demands have expanded to boosting people's purchasing power and allowing popular referendums. Most ""gilets jaunes"" live on low to medium incomes. They range from factory workers, mid-level employees to the self-employed (particularly artisans) and retired people.

"Review: Spat at in the street, Dior disrupted fashion Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂLiveSix Nations - Scotland v Italy1 minute ago1 minute ago 'Scotland have done the job''Scotland have done the job'3 minutes ago Palazzini scores consolation tryPalazzini scores consolation try5 minutes ago Full-time - Scotland 33-20 ItalyFull-time - Scotland 33-20 Italy","This video can not be played Three ways Dior changed fashion forever On Wednesday 12 February 1947 at around 09:45, a queue of insanely glamorous people stood outside 30 Avenue Montaigne, Paris, shivering in temperatures below -5C. Among them was the artist Jean Cocteau, the socialite Lady Diana Cooper and the editors of American Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. It was the coldest winter in a generation. They were freezing. Meanwhile, inside the recently derequisitioned house, people were scurrying around adding the finishing touches to a radical new womenswear fashion collection. Tensions were running high. It was the launch of an haute couture label thought to have cost millions of francs. At 09:59, a portly, middle aged man with a passing resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock walked between the countless flower arrangements installed throughout the house, calmly spraying the scent that Paul Vacher had created for him to set the tone of his eponymous business. At 10:00 precisely, he instructed a member of his staff to open the front door. The 42-year old host, whom the photographer Cecil Beaton described as ""a bland country curate made out of pink marzipan"", welcomed each guest individually and invited them to relax before the presentation of his highly anticipated first collection. Everything was arranged perfectly. It had to be. That was this particular man's way: it was the mark of Christian Dior. Christian Dior's first collection in 1947 was the hottest show in town You can find out what happened next at the V&A in London, which is presenting a retrospective of the Dior label's subsequent 72 years among the international fashion elite. It starts where the story stops at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Christian Dior knew that the townhouse at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris would be the home to his couture label As you walk up to the imposing front door, your way is blocked by a black mannequin wearing the two-tone two-piece that defined both that inaugural 1947 show and Christian Dior. The Bar Suit caused a sensation. It was an extravagant, rebellious response to the grim austerity of post-war Europe. Instead of a dull boxy jacket and no-nonsense skirt that required minimal fabric or imagination to make, Dior presented a soft-shouldered, wasp-waisted silk jacket fanning out over the hips to reveal a long, dark blue pleated skirt, which took many metres of fabric to produce. With its feminine silhouette, the Bar Suit (1947) became the the emblem of the New Look It was outrageously decadent in an era of rationing, but also fabulously exciting: a vision for the future that was colourful, opulent and beautiful. The politicians hated it, as did some members of the public who notoriously spat at and attacked models wearing Dior. There was even an incident, famously captured by the photographer Walter Carone, where a young woman was set upon and stripped by two older ladies of the ""make-do-and-mend"" school who were appalled by what they perceived as her wanton wastefulness. Walter Carone captured the moment a young woman had her clothes torn off by women outraged at what they saw as a waste of fabric The fashionistas saw things differently. They absolutely loved what was immediately known as the New Look. Christian Dior had arrived. Why his work had such an immediate impact is obvious when you step over the threshold and into the first gallery. The designs he produced and the fabrics he used were the epitome of old-school glamour, with elegant lines - or silhouettes - cut from luxurious materials. They are a wonder to behold, at least on the outside. I imagine the whalebone corsets and under-wired structures needed to retain the shape felt neither elegant nor luxurious. Still, Il faut souffrir pour Ãªtre belle, as they say. Christian Dior with model Lucky, circa 1955 Princess Margaret commissioned the Frenchman to make her 21st birthday dress; here - at last - was a designer producing clothes for modern young women, not rich old ladies. The gown he produced for Margaret is displayed beside Beaton's famous photograph of the princess modelling it, behind which is a double-decker display case of the dresses Dior made for other members of Britain's next-gen high society. Christian Dior designed this dress for Princess Margaret, which she wore for 21st birthday celebrations When you enter the third gallery, everything changesâ¦ for a reason. Christian Dior is dead. A decade after that cold February morning in 1947, the designer, who had by now become a household name, suffered a fatal heart attack in Italy. There was talk of closing the business, but Dior had a 21-year-old assistant who was showing some promise, so the board decided to give him a go. Yves Saint Laurent didn't let them down. You can see his Dior design classics mixed with those produced by the five creative directors who followed him, including pieces of Baroque ebullience by John Galliano. They all have their own idiosyncratic style, but there is a ""Diorness"" that unites them, which is most apparent in the display of their re-imagined Bar Suits. Yves Saint Laurent was just 21 years old when he was appointed Dior's creative director, but didn't disappoint John Galliano at Dior pushed the definition of haute couture with his extraordinary and lavish designs Themes rather than chronology take you through the rest of the exhibition. There are galleries dedicated to historicism, the garden, the ateliers and, finally, a glitzy ballroom featuring animated glitter erupting across the ceiling and down the walls. The effect is only marginally compromised by non-slip rubber matting underfoot rather than a sprung wooden floor polished for dancing. Christian Dior wasn't known for skimping on costs, and nor has the V&A. The museum created a rod for its own back with its blockbuster Alexander McQueen show in 2015. It changed visitor expectations forever. A couple of display cases of some nice dresses won't cut the mustard nowadays - punters want a theatrical experience to remember and post on Instagram. And curator Oriole Cullen has delivered just that. This is a fantastic show that builds from a modest scrapbook of family photos at the beginning to a climatic end with over 70-years of creative excellence displayed in the round. It is an unashamed celebration of Christian Dior's joie de vivre. This is by far the most successful exhibition to be held in the museum's recently-opened subterranean gallery. It is a space that would make a decent parking lot, but is a fiendishly difficult place to programme. To give visitors any sense of a narrative flow requires the construction of an inner world that costs, I am told, an eye-watering amount of money. Still, the Kensington institution is expecting a lot of people to come and see the show over the next six months, and so - in the spirit of Christian Dior - it has chosen to invest heavily in Nathalie CriniÃ¨re's exhibition design. Notwithstanding a hairpin bend in the third gallery, she and her team have pulled it off with aplomb and presented an environment that I suspect Christian Dior would not only recognise, but would wander through merrily spraying his Miss Dior perfume.

Syria building collapse kills 11,"The war-damaged block was in a formerly rebel-held area that had been bombed before Syrian forces retook it At least 11 people including four children were killed when a war-damaged apartment block collapsed in the city of Aleppo, state media said. A child was the only survivor from the collapse in the formerly rebel-held area of Salaheddin, which was bombed by Syria and Russia before being retaken. Residents have been eking out a living in ruins across Syria, with little rebuilding taking place. Syria's authorities have so far focused their efforts on basic infrastructure. Several other buildings in Salaheddin near the five-storey block that caved in are on the brink of collapse, AFP reported. Who will help rebuild the former 'capital' of IS? Why is there a war in Syria? UN satellite data from 2017 suggested that more than 35,000 structures in the city had suffered damage. The small amount of residential reconstruction that has taken place there has been carried out privately, AFP reported.

Syria building collapse kills 11A child is the only survivor from the accident in a formerly rebel-held area of the city of Aleppo.,"The war-damaged block was in a formerly rebel-held area that had been bombed before Syrian forces retook it At least 11 people including four children were killed when a war-damaged apartment block collapsed in the city of Aleppo, state media said. A child was the only survivor from the collapse in the formerly rebel-held area of Salaheddin, which was bombed by Syria and Russia before being retaken. Residents have been eking out a living in ruins across Syria, with little rebuilding taking place. Syria's authorities have so far focused their efforts on basic infrastructure. Several other buildings in Salaheddin near the five-storey block that caved in are on the brink of collapse, AFP reported. Who will help rebuild the former 'capital' of IS? Why is there a war in Syria? UN satellite data from 2017 suggested that more than 35,000 structures in the city had suffered damage. The small amount of residential reconstruction that has taken place there has been carried out privately, AFP reported.

Black culture museum for UK 'long overdue',"This video can not be played Sir David thinks the move would benefit generations of black children Architect Sir David Adjaye has called for a ""long overdue"" museum celebrating black culture in Britain. He believes it would help generations of black children to feel part of ""the language, DNA and roots"" of the UK. He explained that the contribution of black people to the British Isles was an important talking point. The British-Ghanaian achieved global fame as the architect of theNational Museum of African-American History and Culture,externalin Washington DC. Speaking to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz, Sir David said that most people believe black Britain began with the Windrush generation  but it actually started much earlier. TheWindrush generationrefers to those people who moved to the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. Sir David Adjaye grew up in Africa, Yemen and Lebanon before moving to Britain Recordssuggest that the reign of Queen Elizabeth I from 1558 to 1603 saw the beginning of Britain's first black community, with black people in Britain as far back as the Roman empire. The museum that Sir David is proposing would aim to make generations of black children feel like they have a place in the nation's future. He said: ""It is really amazingly important for the representation of people in the sort of cultural tropes of the nation."" Sir David, who found it difficult to get commissions at the beginning of his career, started out designing spaces for old art school friends before coming to public attention with the Idea Store library in east London. He originally regarded architecture as an ""insider game"" which he was not part of. The architect is currentlydesigning a national Holocaust memorial and learning centrenext to the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Individual museums around the UK have celebrated black British history and culture over the years with exhibitions of their own. Holocaust memorial design announced A 'living building' for the black American experience.

Opposition rallies begin across VenezuelaSupporters of self-declared interim leader Juan GuaidÃ³ hold protests calling for fresh elections.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Thousands of demonstrators call for Venezuela's President Maduro to go - but others turn out to support him Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Venezuela's capital Caracas in support of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro - and his self-proclaimed interim successor Juan GuaidÃ³. Mr GuaidÃ³ said the country's opposition movement would ""carry on in the streets"". Mr Maduro told supporters he was the only president of Venezuela. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president last month and is backed by the US and several Latin American countries. Russia and China back President Maduro. The stand-off began days after Mr Maduro was sworn in for a second term, following disputed elections which many opposition leaders did not contest because they were in jail or boycotting them. Mr GuaidÃ³, who is head of Venezuela's National Assembly, says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Mr GuaidÃ³ urged his supporters to continue protesting Addressing thousands of supporters in the capital Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ said protests would continue until his supporters achieved ""freedom"". But a pro-Maduro crowd gathered to mark the 20th anniversary of the rise to power of his predecessor, the socialist leader Hugo ChÃ¡vez. Mr Maduro accused international media of ignoring demonstrations by pro-government supporters. Who is supporting whom in Venezuela? Why US sanctions on Venezuela will hurt The rival protests come a day ahead of a deadline given to Mr Maduro by major European countries to announce new presidential elections - otherwise they would also recognise Mr GuaidÃ³. Military support is seen as crucial to Mr Maduro's hold on power. Many supporters at Saturday's rally were seen wearing the khaki uniforms of the government militia. Mr Maduro says the opposition is trying to stage a coup Ahead of the protests, a high-ranking Air Force general announced his support for Mr GuaidÃ³in a video message posted online,external. Gen Francisco Yanez, the force's head of strategic planning, called on other members of the military to join him in defecting. It is not clear when or where the message was recorded. In response,the Air Force's high command accused him of treason,external. But US National Security Adviser John Bolton called on the rest of the country's military to join forces with Gen Francisco Yanez. Allow Twitter content?

In comments published in the South China Morning Post on Saturday, Mr GuaidÃ³ said he wanted a ""productive and mutually beneficial"" relationship with China, adding that he was ready to engage in dialogue ""as soon as possible"". Analysis byJames Reynolds, BBC News,Caracas For the first time in years, Venezuela's opposition feels optimistic. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in the centre of the capital. They want to find a way of bringing about fall of the government they detest. Many have spent years living with shortages. ""I'm 17 and I've only ever seen this government,"" one protester told me. ""I don't want to live under it any more. I'm tired of this."" Francia, a school teacher, told me that her mother had died because of a lack of medicine. ""I have hope again,"" she said. ""We were hopeless a month ago. We believe this is the real change. I've been fighting for almost  20 years. Nobody believed us. Now they do - and we do, too."" ""We are going to carry on in the streets until we achieve freedom and the end of the usurpation [of Maduro],"" he told cheering crowds. He reiterated an appeal to the ""civil and military officials"" of Mr Maduro's administration to back him. ""Soldier of the nation... you have a role in the recovery of Venezuela,"" he said. Mr GuaidÃ³ announced that the opposition would start gathering humanitarian aid from Colombia and Brazil and urged the military to let it into the country. Between 250,000 and 300,000 Venezuelans were ""in danger"" of dying due to food and medicine shortages, he added. This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? In a speech carried live by Venezuelan state TV, President Maduro insisted that his his left-wing revolutionary government would continue in power. Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? ""I am the sovereign president of all Venezuela,"" he said, adding he retained the support of the military, who were ""more loyal than ever"" and calling on the opposition to give up a ""failed"" attempt to seize power. ""Stop calling for war, stop supporting a coup that has already failed,"" Maduro said.

"Review: Spat at in the street, Dior disrupted fashion âââââ","This video can not be played Three ways Dior changed fashion forever On Wednesday 12 February 1947 at around 09:45, a queue of insanely glamorous people stood outside 30 Avenue Montaigne, Paris, shivering in temperatures below -5C. Among them was the artist Jean Cocteau, the socialite Lady Diana Cooper and the editors of American Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. It was the coldest winter in a generation. They were freezing. Meanwhile, inside the recently derequisitioned house, people were scurrying around adding the finishing touches to a radical new womenswear fashion collection. Tensions were running high. It was the launch of an haute couture label thought to have cost millions of francs. At 09:59, a portly, middle aged man with a passing resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock walked between the countless flower arrangements installed throughout the house, calmly spraying the scent that Paul Vacher had created for him to set the tone of his eponymous business. At 10:00 precisely, he instructed a member of his staff to open the front door. The 42-year old host, whom the photographer Cecil Beaton described as ""a bland country curate made out of pink marzipan"", welcomed each guest individually and invited them to relax before the presentation of his highly anticipated first collection. Everything was arranged perfectly. It had to be. That was this particular man's way: it was the mark of Christian Dior. Christian Dior's first collection in 1947 was the hottest show in town You can find out what happened next at the V&A in London, which is presenting a retrospective of the Dior label's subsequent 72 years among the international fashion elite. It starts where the story stops at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Christian Dior knew that the townhouse at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris would be the home to his couture label As you walk up to the imposing front door, your way is blocked by a black mannequin wearing the two-tone two-piece that defined both that inaugural 1947 show and Christian Dior. The Bar Suit caused a sensation. It was an extravagant, rebellious response to the grim austerity of post-war Europe. Instead of a dull boxy jacket and no-nonsense skirt that required minimal fabric or imagination to make, Dior presented a soft-shouldered, wasp-waisted silk jacket fanning out over the hips to reveal a long, dark blue pleated skirt, which took many metres of fabric to produce. With its feminine silhouette, the Bar Suit (1947) became the the emblem of the New Look It was outrageously decadent in an era of rationing, but also fabulously exciting: a vision for the future that was colourful, opulent and beautiful. The politicians hated it, as did some members of the public who notoriously spat at and attacked models wearing Dior. There was even an incident, famously captured by the photographer Walter Carone, where a young woman was set upon and stripped by two older ladies of the ""make-do-and-mend"" school who were appalled by what they perceived as her wanton wastefulness. Walter Carone captured the moment a young woman had her clothes torn off by women outraged at what they saw as a waste of fabric The fashionistas saw things differently. They absolutely loved what was immediately known as the New Look. Christian Dior had arrived. Why his work had such an immediate impact is obvious when you step over the threshold and into the first gallery. The designs he produced and the fabrics he used were the epitome of old-school glamour, with elegant lines - or silhouettes - cut from luxurious materials. They are a wonder to behold, at least on the outside. I imagine the whalebone corsets and under-wired structures needed to retain the shape felt neither elegant nor luxurious. Still, Il faut souffrir pour Ãªtre belle, as they say. Christian Dior with model Lucky, circa 1955 Princess Margaret commissioned the Frenchman to make her 21st birthday dress; here - at last - was a designer producing clothes for modern young women, not rich old ladies. The gown he produced for Margaret is displayed beside Beaton's famous photograph of the princess modelling it, behind which is a double-decker display case of the dresses Dior made for other members of Britain's next-gen high society. Christian Dior designed this dress for Princess Margaret, which she wore for 21st birthday celebrations When you enter the third gallery, everything changesâ¦ for a reason. Christian Dior is dead. A decade after that cold February morning in 1947, the designer, who had by now become a household name, suffered a fatal heart attack in Italy. There was talk of closing the business, but Dior had a 21-year-old assistant who was showing some promise, so the board decided to give him a go. Yves Saint Laurent didn't let them down. You can see his Dior design classics mixed with those produced by the five creative directors who followed him, including pieces of Baroque ebullience by John Galliano. They all have their own idiosyncratic style, but there is a ""Diorness"" that unites them, which is most apparent in the display of their re-imagined Bar Suits. Yves Saint Laurent was just 21 years old when he was appointed Dior's creative director, but didn't disappoint John Galliano at Dior pushed the definition of haute couture with his extraordinary and lavish designs Themes rather than chronology take you through the rest of the exhibition. There are galleries dedicated to historicism, the garden, the ateliers and, finally, a glitzy ballroom featuring animated glitter erupting across the ceiling and down the walls. The effect is only marginally compromised by non-slip rubber matting underfoot rather than a sprung wooden floor polished for dancing. Christian Dior wasn't known for skimping on costs, and nor has the V&A. The museum created a rod for its own back with its blockbuster Alexander McQueen show in 2015. It changed visitor expectations forever. A couple of display cases of some nice dresses won't cut the mustard nowadays - punters want a theatrical experience to remember and post on Instagram. And curator Oriole Cullen has delivered just that. This is a fantastic show that builds from a modest scrapbook of family photos at the beginning to a climatic end with over 70-years of creative excellence displayed in the round. It is an unashamed celebration of Christian Dior's joie de vivre. This is by far the most successful exhibition to be held in the museum's recently-opened subterranean gallery. It is a space that would make a decent parking lot, but is a fiendishly difficult place to programme. To give visitors any sense of a narrative flow requires the construction of an inner world that costs, I am told, an eye-watering amount of money. Still, the Kensington institution is expecting a lot of people to come and see the show over the next six months, and so - in the spirit of Christian Dior - it has chosen to invest heavily in Nathalie CriniÃ¨re's exhibition design.

"Review: Spat at in the street, Dior disrupted fashion Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ","This video can not be played Three ways Dior changed fashion forever On Wednesday 12 February 1947 at around 09:45, a queue of insanely glamorous people stood outside 30 Avenue Montaigne, Paris, shivering in temperatures below -5C. Among them was the artist Jean Cocteau, the socialite Lady Diana Cooper and the editors of American Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. It was the coldest winter in a generation. They were freezing. Meanwhile, inside the recently derequisitioned house, people were scurrying around adding the finishing touches to a radical new womenswear fashion collection. Tensions were running high. It was the launch of an haute couture label thought to have cost millions of francs. At 09:59, a portly, middle aged man with a passing resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock walked between the countless flower arrangements installed throughout the house, calmly spraying the scent that Paul Vacher had created for him to set the tone of his eponymous business. At 10:00 precisely, he instructed a member of his staff to open the front door. The 42-year old host, whom the photographer Cecil Beaton described as ""a bland country curate made out of pink marzipan"", welcomed each guest individually and invited them to relax before the presentation of his highly anticipated first collection. Everything was arranged perfectly. It had to be. That was this particular man's way: it was the mark of Christian Dior. Christian Dior's first collection in 1947 was the hottest show in town You can find out what happened next at the V&A in London, which is presenting a retrospective of the Dior label's subsequent 72 years among the international fashion elite. It starts where the story stops at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Christian Dior knew that the townhouse at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris would be the home to his couture label As you walk up to the imposing front door, your way is blocked by a black mannequin wearing the two-tone two-piece that defined both that inaugural 1947 show and Christian Dior. The Bar Suit caused a sensation. It was an extravagant, rebellious response to the grim austerity of post-war Europe. Instead of a dull boxy jacket and no-nonsense skirt that required minimal fabric or imagination to make, Dior presented a soft-shouldered, wasp-waisted silk jacket fanning out over the hips to reveal a long, dark blue pleated skirt, which took many metres of fabric to produce. With its feminine silhouette, the Bar Suit (1947) became the the emblem of the New Look It was outrageously decadent in an era of rationing, but also fabulously exciting: a vision for the future that was colourful, opulent and beautiful. The politicians hated it, as did some members of the public who notoriously spat at and attacked models wearing Dior. There was even an incident, famously captured by the photographer Walter Carone, where a young woman was set upon and stripped by two older ladies of the ""make-do-and-mend"" school who were appalled by what they perceived as her wanton wastefulness. Walter Carone captured the moment a young woman had her clothes torn off by women outraged at what they saw as a waste of fabric The fashionistas saw things differently. They absolutely loved what was immediately known as the New Look. Christian Dior had arrived. Why his work had such an immediate impact is obvious when you step over the threshold and into the first gallery. The designs he produced and the fabrics he used were the epitome of old-school glamour, with elegant lines - or silhouettes - cut from luxurious materials. They are a wonder to behold, at least on the outside. I imagine the whalebone corsets and under-wired structures needed to retain the shape felt neither elegant nor luxurious. Still, Il faut souffrir pour Ãªtre belle, as they say. Christian Dior with model Lucky, circa 1955 Princess Margaret commissioned the Frenchman to make her 21st birthday dress; here - at last - was a designer producing clothes for modern young women, not rich old ladies. The gown he produced for Margaret is displayed beside Beaton's famous photograph of the princess modelling it, behind which is a double-decker display case of the dresses Dior made for other members of Britain's next-gen high society. Christian Dior designed this dress for Princess Margaret, which she wore for 21st birthday celebrations When you enter the third gallery, everything changesâ¦ for a reason. Christian Dior is dead. A decade after that cold February morning in 1947, the designer, who had by now become a household name, suffered a fatal heart attack in Italy. There was talk of closing the business, but Dior had a 21-year-old assistant who was showing some promise, so the board decided to give him a go. Yves Saint Laurent didn't let them down. You can see his Dior design classics mixed with those produced by the five creative directors who followed him, including pieces of Baroque ebullience by John Galliano. They all have their own idiosyncratic style, but there is a ""Diorness"" that unites them, which is most apparent in the display of their re-imagined Bar Suits. Yves Saint Laurent was just 21 years old when he was appointed Dior's creative director, but didn't disappoint John Galliano at Dior pushed the definition of haute couture with his extraordinary and lavish designs Themes rather than chronology take you through the rest of the exhibition. There are galleries dedicated to historicism, the garden, the ateliers and, finally, a glitzy ballroom featuring animated glitter erupting across the ceiling and down the walls. The effect is only marginally compromised by non-slip rubber matting underfoot rather than a sprung wooden floor polished for dancing. Christian Dior wasn't known for skimping on costs, and nor has the V&A. The museum created a rod for its own back with its blockbuster Alexander McQueen show in 2015. It changed visitor expectations forever. A couple of display cases of some nice dresses won't cut the mustard nowadays - punters want a theatrical experience to remember and post on Instagram. And curator Oriole Cullen has delivered just that. This is a fantastic show that builds from a modest scrapbook of family photos at the beginning to a climatic end with over 70-years of creative excellence displayed in the round. It is an unashamed celebration of Christian Dior's joie de vivre. This is by far the most successful exhibition to be held in the museum's recently-opened subterranean gallery. It is a space that would make a decent parking lot, but is a fiendishly difficult place to programme. To give visitors any sense of a narrative flow requires the construction of an inner world that costs, I am told, an eye-watering amount of money. Still, the Kensington institution is expecting a lot of people to come and see the show over the next six months, and so - in the spirit of Christian Dior - it has chosen to invest heavily in Nathalie CriniÃ¨re's exhibition design. Notwithstanding a hairpin bend in the third gallery, she and her team have pulled it off with aplomb and presented an environment that I suspect Christian Dior would not only recognise, but would wander through merrily spraying his Miss Dior perfume.

US governor sorry for 1984 racist picture,"This video can not be played Virginia governor says sorry for racist photo Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has apologised after his 1984 student yearbook page emerged, showing a photo featuring men in racist costumes. ""I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,"" he said in a statement. Black politicians in Virginia called the image ""disgusting"" and Republicans urged the Democrat to resign. The picture showed a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. It appeared on a page with other photos of Mr Northam, who was aged about 25 at the time, as well as personal details about him. He did not elaborate on which costume he was wearing, but said he appeared in a photograph that was ""clearly racist and offensive"". Racist vandals hit historic Virginia school Note to Virginia waitress: We don't tip black people 'The blackface scandal that rocked my campus' Mr Northam was elected governor of Virginia in November 2017. Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper tweeted a picture of the page which it said it obtained from the medical school library. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An official from the medical school verified the photo and told the Huffington Post it came from a ""student-produced publication"". The page, which features Mr Northam's full name and photos of the future doctor and politician, also included a quote from a Willie Nelson song that read: ""There are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I'll have another beer."" ""This behaviour is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service,"" the governor said in a statement after the image was made public. ""But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians' faith in that commitment."" He continued: ""I recognise that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused. I am ready to do that important work. ""The first step is to offer my sincerest apology and to state my absolute commitment to living up to the expectations Virginians set for me when they elected me to be their governor."" Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Mr Northam in 2017 Mr Northam later released a video statement via Twitter in which he said he was ""deeply sorry"",externalfor the offence the image had caused. ""I accept responsibility for my past actions and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust,"" he said. Before he was elected governor, Mr Northam served for a decade as a Virginia state legislator. His responsibilities as governor include implementing state laws, restoring voting rights for individuals who have had them withdrawn and issuing pardons. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, which comprises African Americans elected to the Virginia General Assembly, said it was ""still processing what we have seen about the governor"" but described the images as ""disgusting, reprehensible and offensive"". ""These pictures rip off the scabs of an excruciatingly painful history and are a piercing reminder of this nation's sins. Those who would excuse the pictures are just as culpable,"" it said in a statement. The photo also prompted a swift backlash from conservatives, including Jack Wilson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who called on Mr Northam to step down. ""Racism has no place in Virginia,"" he said in a statement. ""These pictures are wholly inappropriate. If Governor Northam appeared in blackface or dressed in a KKK robe, he should resign immediately."" Calls for his resignation also came from four Democratic candidates for president- Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and Texan mayor Julian Castro. Allow Twitter content?

Celebrity diet aid ads should be banned - NHS,"Kim Kardashian West has promoted diet aids on social media Social media companies should ban ""damaging"" celebrity-endorsed social media ads promoting weight loss aids, England's top doctor has said. Some celebrities with large followings are promoting products such as diet pills and detox teas on social media. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, argues these products have a damaging effect on the physical and mental health of young people. He is also urging influential celebrities to act ""responsibly"". Prof Powis said: ""If a product sounds like it is too good to be true, then it probably is. ""The risks of quick-fix weight loss outweigh the benefits, and advertising these products without a health warning is damaging. ""Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them, by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. ""Social media companies have a duty to stamp out the practice of individuals and companies using their platform to target young people with products known to risk ill health,"" he said. Some influential celebrities have promoted weight loss aids for payment on social media, and this type of advertising is growing as brands realise how influential their posts are with young people. The Competition and Markets Authority recently announced a clampdown on celebrities who do not clearly label their posts as being paid-for advertisements, but there are few rules around what they can promote. NHS England's national mental health director Claire Murdoch told BBC Breakfast that the intention was not to ""suppress business or comment on what good business looks like"". However, she expressed concern over the influence these celebrities had over young people at an ""impressionable"" stage in their lives. ""Both the celebrities themselves and these social media companies themselves should be more responsible,"" she added. Kim Kardashian West, who has 126 million followers on Instagram,was criticised for advertising appetite-suppressing lollypops last year. She later deleted the post.

"Nazi salutes, laddish societies and safe spaces","How should universities react to a Nazi salute during an anti-Israeli protest on campus? Should a group calling itself Laddism Reborn, which distributes misogynist literature and promotes heavy drinking, be allowed to affiliate to a student union? These are some of the thorny questions that university and student union officials have to weigh up when balancing their legal duty to protect free speech and meeting their duty of care to staff and students. Comprehensive new guidance on lawful free speech, protecting academic freedom and upholding equality has been drawn up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, in collaboration with 10 leading organisations including the Department for Education. It comes just afterWarwick University drew criticism for lessening the punishment of students who admitted their involvement in a group chat that threatened rapeafter an appeal. However, the National Union of Students (NUS) said that while there is no evidence of widespread difficulties with free speech on campus, the guidance would help tackle the myths about problems of dealing with free speech. Entitled, Freedom of Expression: a guide for higher education providers and students' unions in England and Wales, it tackles the tricky issue of how student unions and universities deal with controversial speakers, protect their students from ""hate speech"" and uphold freedom of expression. Is free speech under threat in universities? Campus free speech fears 'whipped up' And it looks at decisions about allowing so-called ""safe spaces"" where people with protected characteristics, such as women or ethnic minorities, are able to gather free from the threat of harassment. Universities have for decades hosted students organising rallies, counter-events and staging sit-ins to protest about issues they hold dear. Under law, everyone has the right to express and receive views and opinions, including those that may ""offend, shock or disturb others"". Higher education bodies have a duty to take all ""reasonably practicable"" steps to allow individuals to express their views during such protests or events. But complaints are often made and counter-protests mounted when offensive views are expressed on campus. This can lead a university authority to feel pressured into cancelling events or restricting protests. The guidance seeks to set out the position in law. While universities have a duty to protect rights to free speech, they must also balance that against the risk of criminal offences. This means visiting speakers can be prevented from attending, for example, if there is a high risk that they may use ""hate speech"" that could incite racial harassment or racial violence or even terrorism. The right decision about such issues and events may seem obvious, but the fictional case studies given in the guidance suggest officials are having to tread a thin line between the two duties. The guidance specifically states that higher education providers must have particular regard to their duties around free speech, when carrying out their duties under counter-terrorism laws. Last month the Oxford Union was criticised for inviting far-right French activist Marion Marechal-Le Pen to speak At the same time, institutions must comply with the public sector equality duty. These include eliminating discrimination, harassment and victimisation, ensuring equal opportunities for people who share relevant protected characteristics. They must also encourage good relations between those with protected characteristics and those without. This requires them to consider the potential impact on students who might feel vilified or marginalised by any views expressed. The practice of ""no-platforming"" has attracted a lot of media attention, but according to the guidelines it is often misunderstood and misreported. The NUS has a ""no-platform"" policy which prevents a set of listed organisations, known to hold racist or fascist views, from speaking at its events. But this policy does not extend to individual student societies. So if a society invites an individual from such a group, and the student union, or other students, attempt to stop them from speaking, it is down to the university to assess whether the person's freedom of expression is being breached. Some student unions have ""safe space"" for certain groups whose characteristics are protected in equality law. Safe spaces have been cited as a reason why freedom of expression may be restricted, although few examples have been found. The guidance says the creation of safe spaces are lawful, but care should be used that they are not applied in a ""blanket manner"" across the campus, where they may limit freedom of expression . According to the guidance, university security officers would be right to allow such a protest to happen if no-one is threatening violence or disorder against anyone specific. But some people have complained about the Nazi salute and argued that the defacing of the flag is anti-Semitic, so they should be stopped. It could be argued that these were public order offences and or incitement to religious or racial hatred. According to the guidelines, if the student responsible for these actions was just an individual, removing them from the protest and allowing it to continue, would probably ""strike the right balance between preventing unlawful acts and protecting free speech"".

Patients 'denied free sanitary products',"Two out of five hospital trusts and health boards in the UK do not give sanitary products to patients who need them, or only in emergencies, an investigation by the BMA has found. The doctors' union says pads and tampons are a basic need and should be available free to inpatients. But in some trusts, razors and shaving foam were handed out free while sanitary products were not. The BMA has written to NHS England asking for action to be taken. For its investigation, the BMA asked a total of 223 trusts and health boards across the UK about the policy towards supplying sanitary products. Out of 187 who responded, 104 said they did supply them. But 25 said they did not supply them at all and 54 said they did, but only in emergencies or in small amounts. None of the trusts and health boards which responded said they had a policy on when sanitary products were handed out. And at 27 trusts, there was nowhere to buy sanitary products anywhere on site. UK's first summit to tackle period poverty held in Bristol Free sanitary products scheme expands in Scotland Leeds City Council set to offer free sanitary products The BMA's investigation is part of a wider campaign to end period poverty, which focuses on making sanitary items more affordable. Eleanor Wilson, a member of the BMA medical students' committee, said: ""When patients are under our care in the NHS, we need to make sure that we make them feel as welcome and as looked after as possible. ""By not providing them with something so key to their health and wellbeing, it has a big impact on their sense of self-worth - we are effectively withholding that dignity from them. ""While some hospitals have good provision, in others, patients have had to face embarrassment and hope that relatives can bring them in. ""For some that is not an option, and it can often become more challenging for young and teenage paediatric patients."" She said sanitary products should be part of a basic package including toilet paper, food, razors and shaving foam, made available to patients when they go into hospital. The BMA also says the impact on the wellbeing of a patient far outweighed the relatively small cost to the NHS. Prof Dame Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA board of science, said hospitals should provide clear information on how patients can access sanitary products during their stay in hospital.

New product safety mark for 'no deal',"Products meeting the standard would carry the UKCA symbol, such as in this mock-up The government has drawn up plans to replace the CE safety symbol on products in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the BBC has learned. Household items such as kettles, light bulbs and toys are stamped with the letters CE. The mark belongs to the European Union, so if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, goods will have to be stamped with a new symbol - UKCA. Some manufacturers are concerned that such a change will be costly. Since 1993, the CE mark has shown consumers that an item meets EU legal requirements and has been tested. The new logo drawn up by the UK government stands for UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA). Officials are expected to unveil the logo shortly. ""A UK mark would provide confidence to consumers and to the authorities that these products meet UK regulatory requirements,"" Scott Steedman of the British Standards Institution told the BBC. ""It provides flexibility for government should there be divergence of regulations to insist that manufacturers were committing to that UK regulatory practice in future,"" he said. The symbol could replace the CE mark in the UK on products such as this toy If the new logo is to be used, companies would have to change their packaging, advertising and an element of the products themselves. For manufacturers, that will mean a one-off cost. ""In a very short period of time, thousands of companies are going to have to spend millions of pounds collectively on changing all their markings to comply with the new mark,"" Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the manufacturers' organisation EEF, told the BBC. ""It's another cost as a result of not doing a deal on Brexit,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Goods made in the UK which are exported to the European Union may have to be stamped with two marks - CE for EU markets and UKCA for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For some products that could also mean two sets of tests, as EU nations may not recognise ones done by UK organisations. ""Products which were assessed by a UK-based notified body will need to be reassessed by an EU-recognised conformity assessment body before placing on the EU market,"" explained part of the government'sno deal planning guidance,externalfor manufacturers. If there is no deal, at the end of March or later, product makers will not have to adopt the new UKCA marking straight away. It is expected that companies will be given a period of grace. That means all the products on the shelves and in warehouses which have the CE mark on them can still be sold legally in the UK. In a previous no-deal planning notice, the government said ""goods made and assessed against EU regulatory requirements can continue to be placed on the UK market after 29 March 2019. This is intended to be for a time-limited period."" A consultation on the length of time is likely to take place. The government insists delivering a deal remains its priority, but it is accelerating no-deal preparations to ensure businesses are prepared for the end of March. What happens now that a deal's been done? What happens after Brexit? How ready is UK government for a no-deal Brexit?

Celebrity diet aid ads should be banned - NHSEngland's top doctor calls on celebrities to be more 'responsible' on social media.Health,"Kim Kardashian West has promoted diet aids on social media Social media companies should ban ""damaging"" celebrity-endorsed social media ads promoting weight loss aids, England's top doctor has said. Some celebrities with large followings are promoting products such as diet pills and detox teas on social media. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, argues these products have a damaging effect on the physical and mental health of young people. He is also urging influential celebrities to act ""responsibly"". Prof Powis said: ""If a product sounds like it is too good to be true, then it probably is. ""The risks of quick-fix weight loss outweigh the benefits, and advertising these products without a health warning is damaging. ""Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them, by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. ""Social media companies have a duty to stamp out the practice of individuals and companies using their platform to target young people with products known to risk ill health,"" he said. Some influential celebrities have promoted weight loss aids for payment on social media, and this type of advertising is growing as brands realise how influential their posts are with young people. The Competition and Markets Authority recently announced a clampdown on celebrities who do not clearly label their posts as being paid-for advertisements, but there are few rules around what they can promote. NHS England's national mental health director Claire Murdoch told BBC Breakfast that the intention was not to ""suppress business or comment on what good business looks like"". However, she expressed concern over the influence these celebrities had over young people at an ""impressionable"" stage in their lives. ""Both the celebrities themselves and these social media companies themselves should be more responsible,"" she added. Kim Kardashian West, who has 126 million followers on Instagram,was criticised for advertising appetite-suppressing lollypops last year. She later deleted the post. In January, she posted an ad promoting meal replacement shakes. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Celebrities settle phone-hacking claims,"Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish were among those to reach settlements with NGN Sir Elton John, Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Mills have settled phone-hacking claims against News Group Newspapers, their lawyers have said. The case involving NGN, publisher of the Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, was due to go to trial next week at the High Court in London. But, on Friday, the trio's solicitors said they had agreed terms with NGN. NGN said ""sincere apologies"" had been offered ""for the distress caused by the invasion of privacy"". ""News Group Newspapers has settled cases relating to voicemail interception at the News of the World which closed in 2011,"" a company spokesman said. They added, however, that NGN made ""no admission of liability"" with regards to ""any allegations of illegal information gathering at the Sun newspaper"". Tennant accepts phone-hacking damages TV stars settle hacking claims Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Mills also settled claims Hamlins, the law firm for the claimants - who also included Sir Elton's husband, David Furnish, and Ms Mills' sister, Fiona - said the claims were ""the fourth trial in the last 18 months which has settled very close to the start of the trial date"". Callum Galbraith, a partner at the firm, said: ""Notwithstanding the settlements and the growing body of evidence, News Group Newspapers Limited continue to refuse to acknowledge that any phone hacking took place at the Sun."" The hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World in 2011 after it emerged that journalists intercepted the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Since then, celebrities including David Tennant, Hugh Grant and Charlotte Church have settled claims against the News of the World over phone-hacking. The News of the World closed inJuly 2011 amid damaging allegations of phone-hacking at the paper, revealed by the Guardian. Journalists hacked into voicemail messages of celebrities by using a default factory-set PIN number. At its time of its closure the Sunday tabloid sold about 2.8 million copies a week, and was famed for its celebrity scoops and sex scandals, earning it the nickname the News of the Screws.

Russia follows US in leaving nuclear pact,"This video can not be played Are we on the cusp of a new nuclear arms race? Russia has suspended its involvement in the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) following a similar decision by the US. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would start developing new missiles. On Friday, the US, which has long accused Russia of violating the treaty, formally announced it was suspending its obligations under the agreement. Signed in 1987 by the US and USSR, it banned the use of short and medium-range missiles by both countries. ""Our American partners announced that they are suspending their participation in the treaty, and we are suspending it too,"" Mr Putin said on Saturday. ""All of our proposals in this sphere, as before, remain on the table, the doors for talks are open,"" he added. Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles Is nuclear control set to self-destruct? Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord Earlier on Saturday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC: ""All [European] allies agree with the United States because Russia has violated the treaty for several years. They are deploying more and more of the new nuclear capable missiles in Europe."" He also said the six-month period the US had given Russia to return to full compliance should be taken advantage of. Russia has denied violating the INF accord. The Americans say they have evidence that a new Russian missile falls within the 500-5,500km (310-3,400 miles) range banned by the treaty. Some US officials have said that a number of 9M729 missiles - known to Nato as SSC-8 - have already been deployed. Russia's new 9M729 missile worries the US and its allies The evidence has been put to Washington's Nato allies andthey have all backed the US case. In December, the Trump administration gave Russia 60 days to return to compliance or the US would also cease to honour its terms. Besides denying breaking the INF treaty, Moscow says that US anti-ballistic missile interceptors being deployed in Eastern Europe could potentially violate the terms of the agreement. At Saturday's meeting with his foreign and defence ministers, President Putin said work would begin on creating new weapons. These, he said, included a land-based version of Russia's sea-launched Kalibr cruise missile, and new hypersonic weapons which can travel more than five times the speed of sound. But Mr Putin said Moscow would not get dragged into an expensive arms race, and would not deploy short- and medium-range missiles unless US weapons were deployed there first. Such an arms race would be a major concern for European countries. ""These new missiles are mobile, hard to detect, nuclear capable, can reach European cities and they have hardly any warning time at all so they reduce the threshold for any potential use of nuclear weapons in a conflict,"" Nato's Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Putin warns Europe on hosting US missiles Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty plan US to leave nuclear treaty with Russia Russia denies breaking missile treaty US: Russia 'violated missile treaty' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Key fact-checkers stop working with Facebook,"Facebook works with more than 30 fact-checking agencies Two leading fact-checking agencies have stopped their work with Facebook, striking a blow to the network's efforts to fight fake news. The social network had paid the Associated Press and Snopes to combat its misinformation crisis. But both firms confirmed they are no longer checking articles. The AP told the BBC it was in ""ongoing conversations"" about work in future. Facebook said it was committed to fighting fake news. The company said it would expand its efforts in 2019. ""Fighting misinformation takes a multi-pronged approach from across the industry,"" a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We are committed to fighting this through many tactics, and the work that third-party fact-checkers do is a valued and important piece of this effort. ""We have strong relationships with 34 fact-checking partners around the world who fact-check content in 16 languages, and we plan to expand the programme this year by adding new partners and languages."" A spokeswoman for the AP told the BBC: ""AP constantly evaluates how to best deploy its fact-checking resources, and that includes ongoing conversations with Facebook about opportunities to do important fact-checking work on its platform."" Snopes said it needed to ""determine with certainty that our efforts to aid any particular platform are a net positive for our online community, publication and staffâ. The site's founder David Mikkelson, and head of operations Vinny Green,said in a blog post that the firm did not rule out working with Facebook in future,external. ""We hope to keep an open dialogue going with Facebook to discuss approaches to combating misinformation that are beneficial to platforms, fact-checking organisations and the user community alike,"" the company said. The blog post acknowledged that choosing not to renew its work with Facebook would have financial repercussions for the company. In 2017, Facebook paid Snopes $100,000 (Â£76,500) for its work. Snopes has not yet released its financial disclosures for 2018. ""Forgoing an economic opportunity is not a decision that we or any other journalistic enterprise can take lightly in the current publishing landscape,"" the company said. Late last year, theGuardian published a report,externalthat suggested fact-checking firms were frustrated by Facebookâs lack of transparency. The article quoted former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski as saying: âTheyâve essentially used us for crisis PR. Theyâre not taking anything seriously. They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buckâ¦ They clearly donât care.â In a blog post, Facebook disputed the Guardian's report,external, saying it had ""several inaccuracies"". Speaking about the news Snopes and the AP had pulled out, Ms Binkowski said she felt Facebook was too controlling over the fact-checking companies. ""Facebook can't handle any kind of pushback, any kind of public criticism,"" she told the BBC, adding that she felt the fact-checking programme at Facebook had been ""mishandled"". Facebook has worked with two other fact-checking agencies in the US. One, Politifact, told the BBC it intended to continue working with Facebook in 2019. The other, Factcheck.org, did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.

Wales tops anti-Semitic Google searches,"The report said someone who searched for ""Jew jokes"" was 100 times more likely to also search for racist jokes about black people Wales has the highest proportion of anti-Semitic Google searches in the UK, a report has said. Analysis for the Community Security Trust (CST) included search terms such as""Jews evil, kill Jews and die Jews"",external. Google estimated the area, based on the user'sIP addressor phone location, and searches in Wales were 7.2% above average for the population size. CST's Dave Rich said it was hard to say why, but fewer Jewish communities could mean more people were uninformed. By comparison, searches in England were 1.9% above average, Northern Ireland was 2.4% below average and Scotland was 6.7% below average. There are about 170,000 anti-Semitic Google searches in the UK each year, but CST did not include a baseline figure against which these averages were measured. Dr Rich, CST's head of policy, said: ""It's hard to speculate about why it may have been higher in Wales - it could be because the Jewish communities are smaller so there's perhaps more ignorance - a lot of racism is based on ignorance."" Hidden hate: what Google searches tell us about antisemitism today was compiled by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a former data scientist at Google, for the CST and Antisemitism Policy Trust. LeBron sorry for 'Jewish money' Instagram post 'Shocking' levels of holocaust denial Man jailed for neo-Nazi graffiti The report said Netta's Eurovision win for Israel in 2018 sparked a 30% spike in anti-Semitic searches online It looked at search terms between 2004 and 2018, including Jew combined with words such as greedy, cheap, racist and ugly. Mr Stephens-Davidowitz admitted it would not capture every instance of anti-Semitic searches, but ""provides a reliable baseline measure"". He also acknowledged it was ""impossible to know for sure that any given search is made by a person with anti-Semitic attitudes, as it is always possible someone was making a search out of curiosity rather than as a result of malign intent"". His research focused on negative stereotypes, violent thoughts, racial epithets and jokes. Anti-Jewish slurs such as yid, kike and heeb were examined - but research for the report showed the majority of those searches were people looking for the definitions of the words ""perhaps because people had heard it being used about Jews and had not come across it before"". Dr Rich, CST's head of policy, said: ""Internet companies have a really important part to play in directing people towards or away from hate content. These companies can use their power for good or for ill."" A Google spokesman said: ""We partner with organisations in the UK who work to tackle hate speech including CST and Stop Hate UK. ""Autocomplete helps you get to the information you are looking for as quickly as possible.

Free speech at universities in spotlight,"How should universities react to a Nazi salute during an anti-Israeli protest on campus? Should a group calling itself Laddism Reborn, which distributes misogynist literature and promotes heavy drinking, be allowed to affiliate to a student union? These are some of the thorny questions that university and student union officials have to weigh up when balancing their legal duty to protect free speech and meeting their duty of care to staff and students. Comprehensive new guidance on lawful free speech, protecting academic freedom and upholding equality has been drawn up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, in collaboration with 10 leading organisations including the Department for Education. It comes just afterWarwick University drew criticism for lessening the punishment of students who admitted their involvement in a group chat that threatened rapeafter an appeal. However, the National Union of Students (NUS) said that while there is no evidence of widespread difficulties with free speech on campus, the guidance would help tackle the myths about problems of dealing with free speech. Entitled, Freedom of Expression: a guide for higher education providers and students' unions in England and Wales, it tackles the tricky issue of how student unions and universities deal with controversial speakers, protect their students from ""hate speech"" and uphold freedom of expression. Is free speech under threat in universities? Campus free speech fears 'whipped up' And it looks at decisions about allowing so-called ""safe spaces"" where people with protected characteristics, such as women or ethnic minorities, are able to gather free from the threat of harassment. Universities have for decades hosted students organising rallies, counter-events and staging sit-ins to protest about issues they hold dear. Under law, everyone has the right to express and receive views and opinions, including those that may ""offend, shock or disturb others"". Higher education bodies have a duty to take all ""reasonably practicable"" steps to allow individuals to express their views during such protests or events. But complaints are often made and counter-protests mounted when offensive views are expressed on campus. This can lead a university authority to feel pressured into cancelling events or restricting protests. The guidance seeks to set out the position in law. While universities have a duty to protect rights to free speech, they must also balance that against the risk of criminal offences. This means visiting speakers can be prevented from attending, for example, if there is a high risk that they may use ""hate speech"" that could incite racial harassment or racial violence or even terrorism. The right decision about such issues and events may seem obvious, but the fictional case studies given in the guidance suggest officials are having to tread a thin line between the two duties. The guidance specifically states that higher education providers must have particular regard to their duties around free speech, when carrying out their duties under counter-terrorism laws. Last month the Oxford Union was criticised for inviting far-right French activist Marion Marechal-Le Pen to speak At the same time, institutions must comply with the public sector equality duty. These include eliminating discrimination, harassment and victimisation, ensuring equal opportunities for people who share relevant protected characteristics. They must also encourage good relations between those with protected characteristics and those without. This requires them to consider the potential impact on students who might feel vilified or marginalised by any views expressed. The practice of ""no-platforming"" has attracted a lot of media attention, but according to the guidelines it is often misunderstood and misreported. The NUS has a ""no-platform"" policy which prevents a set of listed organisations, known to hold racist or fascist views, from speaking at its events. But this policy does not extend to individual student societies. So if a society invites an individual from such a group, and the student union, or other students, attempt to stop them from speaking, it is down to the university to assess whether the person's freedom of expression is being breached. Some student unions have ""safe space"" for certain groups whose characteristics are protected in equality law. Safe spaces have been cited as a reason why freedom of expression may be restricted, although few examples have been found. The guidance says the creation of safe spaces are lawful, but care should be used that they are not applied in a ""blanket manner"" across the campus, where they may limit freedom of expression . According to the guidance, university security officers would be right to allow such a protest to happen if no-one is threatening violence or disorder against anyone specific. But some people have complained about the Nazi salute and argued that the defacing of the flag is anti-Semitic, so they should be stopped. It could be argued that these were public order offences and or incitement to religious or racial hatred. According to the guidelines, if the student responsible for these actions was just an individual, removing them from the protest and allowing it to continue, would probably ""strike the right balance between preventing unlawful acts and protecting free speech"".

"The mistake that led to a Â£1.2bn businessDark Hedges tree falls in high windsChariot burial finds ruled as treasureMy happy, healthy son changed overnightPlastic or paper: Which bag is greener?","Kristo Kaarmann initially wondered whether anyone would trust a website ""set up by two Estonian dudes"" The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Kristo Kaarmann, co-founder and chief executive of money transfer business TransferWise. When Kristo Kaarmann was kicking himself for being ""incredibly stupid"", little did he know that it would spark an idea for a business that is now estimated to be worth more than Â£1.2bn. Back in 2008, the then 28-year-old Estonian was working in London as a management consultant when he got a very chunky Christmas bonus of Â£10,000. As interest rates were higher back in Estonia, he decided that he'd transfer the money from his UK current account to his Estonian savings account, so as to earn more from the cash. The company has its second largest office in Tallinn, the Estonian capital ""So I paid my UK bank a Â£15 fee, and transferred the Â£10,000, and then a week later I saw that Â£500 less than I had expected had arrived in the Estonian account,"" says Kristo, now 38. ""I started digging to find out what had happened, and I realised that I had been incredibly stupid. ""I had foolishly expected that my UK bank would have given me the exchange rate I saw when I looked on [news wires] Reuters and Bloomberg. ""Instead the bank had used an exchange rate 5% less favourable, which is how it and all the other banks get their cut. It was my mistake."" Annoyed with himself, Kristo vowed to come up with a way of transferring money overseas that removed banks from the process. Initially this involved just him and his Estonian friend Taavet Hinrikus, who was then director at telecommunications firm Skype, informally transferring money between themselves. Kristo says that he and Taavet share the leadership work It worked because Kristo often wanted to swap pounds sterling for kroons, the Estonian currency at the time, and vice versa for Taavet. They simply picked whatever was the mid-market exchange rate - the average exchange rate on any given day. Soon they had built up a network of Estonian friends - both expats and those back in Estonia - who were all doing the same thing, and Kristo and Taavet realised they could make a business out of it. So in 2011 they launched London-based TransferWise, a financial technology or ""fintech"" website that allows users to transfer money overseas to a different currency at the mid-market rate for a set fee of 0.5%. Today, TransferWise is a global business, and investors include Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. For the first year, Kristo and Taavet grew the business organically, relying on their savings. Customers first arrived in a trickle thanks to word-of-mouth, but then rose sharply after a positive review on a technology website. Kristo motorcyles in Africa every year over Christmas and New Year To avoid any legal problems, Kristo and Taavet had secured clearance and licences from the UK's then regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, before they launched. ""It was the first time they had ever seen anything like us,"" says Kristo. ""But they saw enough that they weren't worried that we would be doing anything shady."" In early 2012 Kristo and Taavet started to look for their first investors, but initially struggled to secure any. ""We talked to maybe 15 investors in total, but they all turned us down,"" says Kristo. ""No-one in Europe would touch us - European investors back then were far more risk averse than American ones. ""So we took our first funding from a small fund in New York called IA Ventures."" Sir Richard Branson invested in TransferWise in 2014 As TransferWise then steadily grew, other investors followed. It has now raised Â£305m in total. Meanwhile, its website and app have been used by more than four million people, and are available in 50 countries and 49 currencies. The company says that Â£3bn is now transferred via its service every month.

Its annual profit remained flat at Â£6.2m. Prior to March 2017, the company had always reported a loss, as funds were put into its expansion. It now has 1,400 employees. Fintech author and commentator Chris Skinner says that TransferWise grew so quickly because it was cheap for people to use, and there were no hidden fees. The company has 10 offices around the world ""Add to this some major heavyweights investing in and backing the business, and you have a potential success on your hands,"" he says. ""I say potential though, as even with a good idea, good marketing, good investors and good backing, nothing is guaranteed in this world.

"Dark Hedges tree falls in high windsChariot burial finds ruled as treasureMy happy, healthy son changed overnightPlastic or paper: Which bag is greener?","The Dark Hedges are estimated to date back to about 1775 A tree made famous by the TV fantasy drama Game of Thrones has fallen in strong winds. Gale force winds of up to 60 mph hit Northern Ireland overnight on Saturday. The Dark Hedges are a tunnel of beech trees on the Bregagh Road near Armoy that have become an an international tourist attraction since featuring in the hit series. Some of the trees were previously damaged during the turbulent weather of Storm Hector in June 2018. The intertwined beech branches and gnarled trunks make the Dark Hedges an iconic sight The trees were originally planted by the Stuart family along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion. Over the decades, the branches grew over the road and became entangled and intertwined, creating a covered passageway with something of an ethereal feel. Originally, there were about 150 trees, but time has taken its toll and now only about 90 remain. Paddy Cregg, from the Woodland Trust, told BBC News NI that the trees date back to 1775 and by beech tree standards, they were ""old aged pensioners"". He added: ""They are coming to the end of their life, normally beech trees survive around 250 years, they are probably now 240 years old. ""It's sad to see that one by one they are actually falling"".

"Chariot burial finds ruled as treasureMy happy, healthy son changed overnightPlastic or paper: Which bag is greener?","This terret ring would have guided the chariot reins Parts of an Iron Age chariot found by a metal detectorist have been declared treasure by the Pembrokeshire coroner. Mike Smith made the discovery in February 2018 on farmland in the south of the county. The court at Milford Haven heard on Thursday the finds were part of the ritual burial of an entire chariot and that the site is now legally protected. Mr Smith says the 2,000-year-old finds could be worth a ""life-changing"" six to seven figure sum. The nine artefacts are now Crown property and a independent valuation committee will decide on the payment to Mr Smith. That will be shared fifty-fifty between Mr Smith and the landowner. Mike Smith expects to receive a 'life-changing' payment for his finds ""It's guess work,"" said Mr Smith after the inquest. ""But you're definitely talking six or seven figures. ""It's the biggest ever metal detecting find, as in there's never been a chariot ever discovered by a metal detectorist. There've been hoards found, but never anything like this."" He now hopes he can afford to buy a bungalow for himself and his wife who has difficulty climbing stairs. ""I still can't believe it. Obviously I've read other people's finds. I've watched them on telly, and I've always thought, I wouldn't mind finding that, it's still surreal, and life-changing,"" said Mr Smith who has been metal detecting since 1977. National Museum Wales said it will try to acquire the treasure ""for the national collection and on behalf of the people of Wales"". Mike Smith first thought this bridle decoration was a medieval brooch It was a chance find after the weather forced Mr Smith's to switch to another field. When an expert told him it was a Celtic harness decoration and not a medieval brooch, he realised there might be more. Mr Smith, from Milford Haven said: ""It's very difficult to describe, you know it when you see it, and you know it's special."" He thought immediately that the artefacts pointed to the site of a traditional burial, usually reserved for high-ranking tribe members who would be interred complete with their chariot, horses, tack and weapons. ""The chariot's definitely thereâ¦ and the body's in itâ¦ It's the first one found outside of Yorkshire,"" he said. Unearthing hidden treasures Heat wave reveals ancient Welsh sites DIY remote control detector's jackpot,external Last summer he helped archaeologists carry out an initial dig which revealed more parts. The undisclosed site was then covered up again and scheduled as an ancient monument. The tops of a pair of wheels revealed by the trial excavation The finds were identified and dated to probably AD 25-75 by curators and museum archaeologists at National Museum Wales by comparing them with others already known across Britain. Red glass was made and allowed to cool into shaped recesses in the bronze surfaces, creating distinctive and vibrant flowing designs. Gwilym Hughes, head of Cadw said: ""The objects demonstrate imaginative and clever craftsmanship, reflecting an inner world of colour and beauty."" The Celtic designs known as late La TÃ¨ne art are the first to be discovered in Pembrokeshire The museum's principal curator of prehistoric archaeology, Adam Gwilt, said: ""These chariot pieces may have been witness to some of the historical events of the time, as Iron Age peoples defended their ways of life and identities, in the face of an expanding Roman empire."" The museum now hopes it has the funding for a full excavation in the Spring. ""Something like this takes a lot of organisation and funding as well so we've been working with  a number of partners to put together what's needed to do a continuing investigation,"" he said. It is expected that more treasure inquests will be needed when the new dig gets underway and Mr Smith would still have a claim to future finds.

"My happy, healthy son changed overnightPlastic or paper: Which bag is greener?","This video can not be played 'Overnight, something went very wrong' A mother is calling for greater awareness of a little-known condition she believes changed her easy-going son overnight. Alison Maclaine fears some children are being misdiagnosed with autism and mental health issues when they are really suffering an infection which can be treated simply with antibiotics. Her eight-year-old son Jack suffered distressing personality changes and ""lost a year of his life"". And she said she was left ""in despair"" that she and her family had ""no quality of life"". Now Alison believes he was suffering from Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANDAS), triggered by a streptococcal infection - a condition that can be treated with simple antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. Jack went to bed one Friday in January last year, looking forward to a football tournament he was playing in the next day. But on arrival at the venue on Saturday morning he became overwhelmed with anxiety. After several attempts, he was unable to enter the building. At home in Dumfries, Alison realised something was very wrong. She told the BBC: ""He started to repeatedly apologise. He said he didn't deserve to have fun, didn't deserve to have friends, didn't deserve to have nice things, didn't deserve to play football. Alison Maclaine knew her son's diagnosis was not right and did her own research into his symptoms ""That eventually led to 'I don't deserve to live, when I get home I am just going to sit outside until I freeze to death'."" When it came to bedtime, Jack refused to have covers and pillows and started to repeat that he needed to die, until he fell asleep. The following day saw his behaviour sink further. Alison said: ""One of the worst things in the world must be listening to your child telling you he wanted to die and asking you to help him."" According to the charity PANS PANDAS UK, PANS (Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) is a neuropsychiatric condition which is triggered by a misdirected immune response which results in an inflammation of a child's brain. PANDAS is a subset of PANS, triggered by a misdirected immune response to a streptococcal infection which results in an inflammation of a child's brain. Happening very quickly, this can cause a child to exhibit symptoms including anxiety, aggressive behaviour, depression, clumsiness, insomnia and the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was first recognised in the United States in 1998 where PANS PANDAS charities estimate as many as one in 200 children could be affected. In 2018, the World Health Organisation recognised the condition, but in the UK it is not widely known. There is no clear test for the condition so doctors often have to rule out psychiatric conditions. The immediate response to antibiotic or anti-inflammatory treatment is often what confirms the condition. The charity PANS PANDAS UK said a failure to understand the condition in the UK means that children are regularly wrongly referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Jack then became aggressive and withdrew from his beloved younger sister Cara. He would become irritable and angry and started to regress, playing with baby toys. Over the next several months he was repeatedly diagnosed as having autism and severe anxiety. But Alison, herself a psychiatrist, disagreed. She said: ""It got to the point where I really felt absolute despair. ""I felt that he had no quality of life, we had no quality of life. There were times when I contemplated things."" His family feels that Jack is ""back"" That despair led to Alison doing her own research and the discovery of PANS and PANDAS. Alison said reading the symptoms was like reading a description of her son and his behavioural changes. Jack was finally diagnosed privately by a consultant paediatrician in England and treated with simple antibiotics. They worked overnight and Alison had her son back. She said: ""Jack responded dramatically to the treatment. He hadn't left the street in five months except for school. After two days on antibiotics he wanted to come to Morrisons with me and Cara.  It felt like Jack was back."" Dr Tim Ubhi finally diagnosed PANDAS in Jack Alison is frustrated now, believing if Jack had been given got antibiotics when he first presented to the GP in January, the outcome would have been different. She said: ""It is so frustrating knowing the treatment was so simple. Now I hate to think there are other children in the situation that they have this disorder that has not been picked up on and have been sent down a mental health/psychological route which can't fix the problem."" Dr Tim Ubhi, who diagnosed Jack's condition, said: ""The problem here is if we do not recognise this condition and we ignore it, potentially there are children out there who are suffering who could actually get treated and actually improve their symptoms. ""So we have a responsibility as physicians to think about this as a condition and do the work to actually create an awareness of what the condition is doing in the UK."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We appreciate that watching any loved one suffer is heartbreaking, even more so when it is a child. ""We are working together with partners to improve the outcomes and support for adults and children with rare conditions, and ensure that everyone receives the appropriate treatment. ""Ministers are unable to make or influence clinical decisions or definitions, and it would not be appropriate for them to do so.""

Ban celebrity ads for diet aids says NHS,"Kim Kardashian West has promoted diet aids on social media Social media companies should ban ""damaging"" celebrity-endorsed social media ads promoting weight loss aids, England's top doctor has said. Some celebrities with large followings are promoting products such as diet pills and detox teas on social media. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, argues these products have a damaging effect on the physical and mental health of young people. He is also urging influential celebrities to act ""responsibly"". Prof Powis said: ""If a product sounds like it is too good to be true, then it probably is. ""The risks of quick-fix weight loss outweigh the benefits, and advertising these products without a health warning is damaging. ""Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them, by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. ""Social media companies have a duty to stamp out the practice of individuals and companies using their platform to target young people with products known to risk ill health,"" he said. Some influential celebrities have promoted weight loss aids for payment on social media, and this type of advertising is growing as brands realise how influential their posts are with young people. The Competition and Markets Authority recently announced a clampdown on celebrities who do not clearly label their posts as being paid-for advertisements, but there are few rules around what they can promote. NHS England's national mental health director Claire Murdoch told BBC Breakfast that the intention was not to ""suppress business or comment on what good business looks like"". However, she expressed concern over the influence these celebrities had over young people at an ""impressionable"" stage in their lives. ""Both the celebrities themselves and these social media companies themselves should be more responsible,"" she added. Kim Kardashian West, who has 126 million followers on Instagram,was criticised for advertising appetite-suppressing lollypops last year. She later deleted the post. In January, she posted an ad promoting meal replacement shakes. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Roger Stone judge mulls gagging order,"Roger Stone regularly flashes a double V-sign in the style of Richard Nixon The judge overseeing the criminal case against ex-Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone says she is considering a gagging order on both him and the prosecution. Judge Amy Berman Jackson said the case was ""a criminal proceeding and not a public relations campaign"". Mr Stone has been charged on seven counts by special counsel Robert Mueller, including witness tampering and lying to Congress. He denies any wrongdoing and has made frequent jibes against Mr Mueller. Mr Stone, 66, a longstanding ally of the president, has previously vowed to resist any gagging order, saying on Tuesday: ""I will fight and the deep state is in panic mode."" Mr Mueller is overseeing an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether Donald Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow. President Trump denies collusion, calling the investigation ""a witch hunt"", and the Kremlin denies any meddling. Who is Trump confidant Roger Stone? All you need to know about Trump Russia story At a court hearing in Washington on Friday, Judge Jackson cited a number of ""extrajudicial statements by the defendant"". She said that if a gagging order was imposed, Mr Stone would still be able to talk to the media about issues not connected to the case. She asked both sides to respond to the possible order by 8 February. The charges against Mr Stone are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign. Since his arrest, Mr Stone has given a string of media interviews. He has been highly critical of his arrest, describing it as political theatrics. ""To storm my house with greater force than was used to take down (Osama) bin Laden or El Chapo or Pablo Escobar, to terrorise my wife and my dogs, is unconscionable,"" he told reporters. He has accused Mr Mueller of running a politically motivated ""inquisition"". This video can not be played US politics is not a beanbag, says Roger Stone In an interview with Reuters, Mr Stone dismissed the charges as ""process crimes"" with no intentional lies. He said any failure to disclose emails or texts had been an ""honest mistake"". In a phone interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his radio programme Infowars, Mr Stone said he intended to ""fight for my life"". ""There's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges. There's no circumstance under which I would bear false witness to the president,"" he said. The special counsel has accused Mr Stone of attempting to obstruct the investigation into Russian meddling by: Lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what transpired between him and Wikileaks Lying to the committee about records of his interactions with Wikileaks Witness tampering, by trying to keep his Wikileaks intermediary from telling the truth to Congress The indictment does not say Mr Stone committed any criminal activity during the election. After his arrest he was released on $250,000 (Â£189,000) bail and with restrictions allowing him to travel only for court appearances in Florida, Washington DC and New York. A long-time friend of Donald Trump, Roger Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s and is a self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"". Mueller disputes Buzzfeed's Trump report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? He began his career working on Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election bid, and has a tattoo of the 37th president across his shoulder blades. Mr Stone became embroiled in the Watergate scandal after congressional hearings revealed that he hired an operative to infiltrate the campaign of George McGovern, Mr Nixon's Democratic opponent. He went on to work for Ronald Reagan's successful presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984, and advised George HW Bush in his bid for the White House in 1988.

Ban phones in schools - minister,"Pupils should be banned from taking smartphones into school, the minister for school standards in England has told the BBC. Nick Gibb spoke out ahead of the government publishing new guidance for schools, expected to address internet safety, social media and online gaming. It is expected to say children should be taught to limit the amount of time they spend online. Schools have the power to ban phones from being taken on to the premises. But government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine whether this is appropriate. Patsy Kane, executive head teacher at the Education and Leadership Trust in Manchester, said Mr Gibb's plan was ""missing the point on just how fantastically useful mobile phones can be for learning."" She told BBC Breakfast her multi-academy trust encourages the responsible use of smartphones during lessons and that teachers do remove the devices if they are used inappropriately during school time. She added: ""There's a fantastic range of apps now for revision - and the students are really motivated to use them."" Should phones be allowed in schools? Ofsted chief inspector backs phones ban Schools 'should have consistent policy on phones' French MPs back mobile phone ban in schools The trade union that represents head teachers has expressed its scepticism about outright bans. But Mr Gibb said: ""Many schools have already taken the decision to ban mobile phones from the classroom. ""While this is clearly a matter for the head teacher, my own view is that schools should ban their pupils from bringing smartphones into school or the classroom."" Katie Ivens, of the Campaign for Real Education, said she supported a classroom ban but that pupils should be allowed to carry phones to and from school for safety. What is known as ""relationships education"" is to become compulsory from September 2020, with schools being encouraged to teach it from September of this year. Last summer, the governmentpublished draft guidance,externalabout how this could be implemented. ""Children and young people are growing up in an increasingly complex world and living their lives seamlessly on and offline,"" it said. But it acknowledged that while this presented ""many positive and exciting opportunities"" there were also ""challenges and risks"". Since the publication of the document, which said ""pupils should be taught about the benefits of balancing time spent on and offline"", there have been more than 11,000 responses to it and new guidance is expected soon. ""Children should not be spending hours and hours on their smartphones or iPads. There are obviously huge benefits to the internet and there's nothing intrinsically damaging about spending time online,"" Mr Gibb said. ""But if the time children spend using social media or playing computer games becomes excessive, it drives out time for them to talk to their parents, exercise, do their homework or play with friends. ""It eats into the amount of sleep and rest children have, resulting in their coming into school the next day tired and unable to concentrate."" The minister, who has spent more than six years at the Department for Education, added: ""Ensuring children can regulate their own use of smartphones and social media is becoming an increasingly important life skill for them to learn."" But the NAHT union, which represents school leaders, has said banning pupils from taking a mobile phone to school can be counterproductive. Giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee in October last year, the union's senior policy adviser Sarah Hannafin said: ""Mobile phone bans certainly work for some schools but there isn't one policy that will work for all schools. ""Outright banning mobile phones can cause more problems than it solves, driving phone use 'underground' and making problems less visible and obvious for schools to tackle."" She added: ""Ultimately, schools work to prepare young people for the outside world, giving them the awareness and strategies to responsibly monitor their own screen use and the ability to identify and deal with any negative impacts or problematic content they encounter.""

US governor sorry for racist yearbook photo,"This video can not be played Virginia governor says sorry for racist photo Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has apologised after his 1984 student yearbook page emerged, showing a photo featuring men in racist costumes. ""I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,"" he said in a statement. Black politicians in Virginia called the image ""disgusting"" and Republicans urged the Democrat to resign. The picture showed a man in blackface and another man in Ku Klux Klan robes. It appeared on a page with other photos of Mr Northam, who was aged about 25 at the time, as well as personal details about him. He did not elaborate on which costume he was wearing, but said he appeared in a photograph that was ""clearly racist and offensive"". Racist vandals hit historic Virginia school Note to Virginia waitress: We don't tip black people 'The blackface scandal that rocked my campus' Mr Northam was elected governor of Virginia in November 2017. Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper tweeted a picture of the page which it said it obtained from the medical school library. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An official from the medical school verified the photo and told the Huffington Post it came from a ""student-produced publication"". The page, which features Mr Northam's full name and photos of the future doctor and politician, also included a quote from a Willie Nelson song that read: ""There are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I'll have another beer."" ""This behaviour is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service,"" the governor said in a statement after the image was made public. ""But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians' faith in that commitment."" He continued: ""I recognise that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused. I am ready to do that important work. ""The first step is to offer my sincerest apology and to state my absolute commitment to living up to the expectations Virginians set for me when they elected me to be their governor."" Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Mr Northam in 2017 Mr Northam later released a video statement via Twitter in which he said he was ""deeply sorry"",externalfor the offence the image had caused. ""I accept responsibility for my past actions and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust,"" he said. Before he was elected governor, Mr Northam served for a decade as a Virginia state legislator. His responsibilities as governor include implementing state laws, restoring voting rights for individuals who have had them withdrawn and issuing pardons. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, which comprises African Americans elected to the Virginia General Assembly, said it was ""still processing what we have seen about the governor"" but described the images as ""disgusting, reprehensible and offensive"". ""These pictures rip off the scabs of an excruciatingly painful history and are a piercing reminder of this nation's sins. Those who would excuse the pictures are just as culpable,"" it said in a statement. The photo also prompted a swift backlash from conservatives, including Jack Wilson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who called on Mr Northam to step down. ""Racism has no place in Virginia,"" he said in a statement. ""These pictures are wholly inappropriate. If Governor Northam appeared in blackface or dressed in a KKK robe, he should resign immediately."" Calls for his resignation also came from four Democratic candidates for president- Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and Texan mayor Julian Castro. Allow Twitter content?

Energy firms handed new customers amid probe,"Two energy suppliers which have been handed the domestic customers of collapsed firms are themselves under investigation by the regulator Ofgem. Economy Energy and Our Power recently ceased trading and their customers have been automatically switched to Ovo and Utilita respectively. Both Ovo and Utilita are themselves the subject of continuing inquiries over the treatment of customers. They say the issues are historic and Ofgem has been rigorous. In the past year, a number of suppliers have ceased trading, with Economy Energy and Our Power both collapsing in January. When this happens, customers are automatically transferred to a new supplier. These customers' supplies are protected but their tariff is not. Winter likely to finish off some energy firms, analysts say Any credit they had with their old supplier - in cases where they had used less energy than they had paid for - is carried over. However, in cases of this kind, customers are given a new tariff with the new supplier that may be more expensive than their current deal. They are given the opportunity to switch. The so-called ""supplier of last resort"" system is quick and ensures that customers' gas and electricity supplies are not cut off. Many of the customers of failed firms have faced difficulties owing to poor customer service, so they may question Ofgem's decision to move them to suppliers who are currently under investigation. Ofgem is investigatingwhether Ovo gave inaccurate estimates to its customersover how much energy they had used during the winter of 2016-17, potentially leading to inaccurate bills. In January, Ovo successfully bid for the custom of the 235,000 customers who needed a supplier when Economy Energy ceased trading. Meanwhile, Utilita was one of four suppliers which was put under investigation by Ofgem followinga review of how suppliers handled customer complaints. It has now been handed 31,000 customers from collapsed supplier, Our Power. A spokesman for Utilita said the company had made vast improvements in its customer service, and that Ofgem conducted a thorough review before awarding them the new customers. An Ovo spokeswoman said: ""Ofgem's investigation relates to historic customer issues and does not reflect Ovo today."" An Ofgem spokesman said: As part of the supplier of last resort process we were again crystal clear with Utilita about our expectations on customer service improvement and they have made a firm commitment to improve. ""They have also assured us that they have a specific plan for addressing outstanding concerns, including significantly driving down call waiting times and making it easy for all customers to contact them. ""The tariff Utilita will put these customers on is also competitive in comparison with the prices for other suppliers for serving these customers."" A cap on the cost of energy for loyal customers who have not switched suppliers came into force at the start of January. Many households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs - such as standard variable tariffs - would have seen their energy bills fall as a result. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. Those on a prepayment meter already have a price cap in place. The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. The cap is on the unit price of energy, and the standing charge. Ofgem said the cap meant that typical usage by a dual fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost no more than Â£1,137 a year, an estimated average saving of Â£76 a year for 11 million people. The level of the cap is updated every six months, at the start of April and the start of October, this year and next year, and possibly beyond. Where the cap will be set from April 2019 will be announced on Thursday. The cap is expected to rise, making energy more expensive for the customers on these default tariffs. Widespread speculation has suggested that it will rise by about Â£100. Ofgem is expected to allow the companies to charge more owing to the greater cost of energy on the wholesale market than was previously the case. A complex set of calculations is behind the setting of the cap, which includes factors such as allowances for operating costs and profits. The introduction of the cap has reduced the difference between the most expensive tariffs on the market from about Â£300 a year to Â£200 a year. However, Ofgem and consumer groups are stressing that customers who choose to switch to a better deal than a default tariff can save money. They may also want to consider customer service scores when choosing their gas and electricity provider.

Mum guilty of girl's genital mutilation,"Police said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"" in the woman's home, including limes stuffed with written curses A woman who mutilated her three-year-old daughter has become the first person in the UK to be found guilty of female genital mutilation (FGM). The 37-year-old mother from east London wept in the dock as she was convicted after a trial at the Old Bailey. Spells and curses intended to deter police and social workers from investigating were found at the Ugandan woman's home, the trial heard. Her 43-year-old partner was acquitted by the jury. Prosecutors said the mother ""coached"" her daughter ""to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught"". The defendants, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denied FGM and an alternative charge of failing to protect a girl from risk of genital mutilation. Mrs Justice Whipple warned of a ""lengthy"" jail term as she remanded the woman into custody to be sentenced on 8 March. More than 5,000 newly-recorded FGM cases in England Anatomy of female genital mutilation 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' FGM - intentionally altering or injuring the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons - carries a sentence of up to 14 years in jail. During the trial, the woman claimed her daughter, then aged three, ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"" after she had climbed to get a biscuit in August 2017. Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone. She ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries they had delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found with pieces of paper with names written on them stuffed inside, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. ""These people were to 'shut up' and 'freeze their mouths',"" Ms Carberry said. ""There was a jar with a picture of a social worker in pepper found hidden behind the toilet in the bathroom,"" she added. This video can not be played Campaigner Aneeta Prem believes more people will now come forward to report cases It is only the fourth FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK. The previous cases led to acquittals. FGM campaigner Aneeta Prem, from Freedom Charity, said convictions were hard to secure because cuttings were ""hidden in secrecy"". ""People are scared to come forward, professionals are scared to come forward to report this,"" she told the BBC. ""The fact that we have a conviction today is a really historic moment."" FGM survivor describes witnessing her sister being cut UK pledges Â£50m to help end FGM in Africa Home Secretary Sajid Javid said FGM was a ""medieval practice"". ""We will not tolerate FGM and not rest until perpetrators of this horrific crime are brought to justice,"" he added. Police also found two cow tongues with nails in them Lynette Woodrow, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the ""sickening"" offence had been committed against a victim with ""no power to resist or fight back"". ""We can only imagine how much pain this vulnerable young girl suffered and how terrified she was,"" she said. ""Her mother then coached her to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught, but this ultimately failed."" Ms Woodrow said FGM victims were often affected physically and emotionally for ""their entire life"". Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the CPS said. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the conviction sent ""a clear message to those who practise this barbaric act"". ""Every woman and girl should be safe and feel safe wherever they are in London, and we will continue our fight to end FGM with every power we have,"" he added.

Wales comeback sinks FranceWales make a dramatic winning start to the Six Nations with a second-half revival to beat France.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Six Nations: Wales beat France in comeback in opening game Six Nations: France v Wales France (16) 19 Tries: Picamoles, HugetPens: Lopez 2Drop-goal: Lopez Wales (0) 24 Tries: T Williams, North 2Cons: Anscombe 2, BiggarPens: Biggar Wales made a dramatic winning start to the Six Nations as they staged a second-half revival to beat France. The hosts started superbly and surged into a 16-0 half-time lead with tries from Louis Picamoles and Yoann Huget. After an error-strewn first 40 minutes, Wales were unrecognisable in the second as Tomos Williams and George North crossed to put them 17-16 ahead. Camille Lopez put France back in front but North intercepted a wild pass to seal Wales' 10th straight win. The match-winning score came after a moment of madness from French lock Sebastien Vahaamahina, who undermined his side's earlier good work by throwing a recklessly high-risk miss-pass which North picked off and juggled before speeding to the line. The British and Irish Lions wing had shown a similarly predatory instinct for his first try, pouncing on Huget's calamitous fumble on his own line. It was fitting that Wales' triumph should come from their ability to seize on French mistakes, as this was a match littered with errors and defined by wildly fluctuating swings of momentum. For Wales, it was also a result of huge relief after a first half which threatened to derail their Six Nations before it had begun in earnest. A clean sweep of victories in the autumn series earlier this season had helped build a groundswell of optimism around Welsh rugby with this year's World Cup on the horizon. Yet that sense of buoyancy threatened to be punctured by a limp first 40 minutes, ruthlessly exploited by an impressive French side. But Wales' second-half resurgence turned the game on its head and secured a 10th successive win for the first time since 1999. Relive Wales' stunning fightback as it happened Coach, father, leader: Who is the real Gatland? This video can not be played 'A super bit of play' - Huget scores France's second try Wales head coach Warren Gatland had declared in typically bullish fashion that he believed his side would go on to win the Six Nations if they triumphed in Paris. The New Zealander had some reason to be optimistic, having led Wales to seven victories from their 13 meetings with France during his reign. However, 2017's defeat - a chaotic match which ended with 20 minutes of added time - meant Gatland had lost on three of his five visits to the Stade de France with Wales. This, his final trip to the French capital as Wales coach, he hoped would be a different story - and it was, in as much as this was nothing like the tight contests these two sides have produced in recent years. Instead, Wales were blown away by a French side playing their best rugby for an age. Having handed France the initiative with Picamoles' sixth-minute try - well finished, albeit against less than fierce tackling - Wales faced torrential pressure in the early exchanges. The visitors made matters worse with a raft of handling errors and missed tackles and, even when they fashioned a scoring opportunity, they squandered it. Liam Williams, one of the few bright sparks for Wales in the first half with his menacing runs in open play, had supporting runners either side of him when he broke clear but, after ignoring them, he crossed the line only for his try to be disallowed by the television match official as replays showed him to have knocked on. After Huget crossed for France's second try, Wales were staring at a heavy defeat but, after some wayward goal-kicking from Morgan Parra a half-time deficit of 16-0 felt like some form of mercy for Gatland's men. This video can not be played Six Nations: George North crosses after Yoann Huget mistake Gatland and defence coach Shaun Edwards are not men to mince their words, so you would safely assume they will have given Wales' players an unflinchingly honest assessment of their performance at half-time. Whatever it is they said, it had the desired effect as Wales emerged for the second half a team transformed. Williams got the ball rolling six minutes after the restart, scampering to the line after Josh Adams had drifted infield from the left wing to make an incisive break. Less than five minutes later, Wales had cut the French lead to just two points. With a penalty advantage, Hadleigh Parkes tried his luck with a speculative grubber kick which looked like a simple one to gather but Huget inexplicably dithered and dropped the ball, which North then smartly picked up and dived over in one swift movement. Around the hour mark, Wales made a raft of changes and it was one of those introduced at that point, Dan Biggar, who gave them the lead for the first time, his nerveless penalty sailing over from 40 yards. France were not done, though. After pulverising a Welsh scrum, Les Bleus were awarded a penalty in front of the posts which Camille Lopez sent over to regain the lead and set up a tense final 10 minutes. The hosts had wrestled momentum back but, just as it looked like they were about to strengthen their grip on the game, they pressed the self-destruct button again as Vahaamahina's brainless long pass was intercepted by North. This video can not be played 'Brilliant' North crosses for second try as Wales gain five-point lead France had been in a rut having won just one of their previous seven matches, and their miserable autumn campaign was rounded off with a home defeat against Fiji. Head coach Jacques Brunel sought to arrest that slump with some bold selections, replacing the experienced and exceptionally bulky centre Mathieu Bastareaud with 19-year-old debutant Romain Ntamack, son of former France wing Emile Ntamack. If Bastareaud's surprising omission from the matchday squad meant a little less weight among the backs, there was no shortage of ballast in a pack of forwards weighing close to 20 stone each. The intention was clear: France were looking to outmuscle Wales. They did that initially, and then some. Les Bleus were quicker and smarter than their lacklustre opponents and, as well as the brawn of the pack, they had the brains of their backs - with Parra marshalling the side from scrum-half. While much of the pre-match attention was focused on new faces such as Ntamack and debutant lock Paul Willemse, it was France's more established players who inspired their first-half domination. Picamoles was prominent in defence and attack and took his try well, as did Huget as he sped to the corner. But then in keeping with their deeply-ingrained tradition of being as erratic as they are talented, France imploded. Huget's fumble was dreadful but, if he was scrambling for excuses, he might have pointed to the difficult conditions that came with the rain. That would have been charitable to allow that as a reason - but there was no excusing Vahaamahina's rush of blood to the head. Even by France's recent standards, it was an act of astounding self-destruction but, for North and Wales, it was an opportunity they grasped with relish.

"Rape chat student 'devastated' over responseOne woman said her trauma was ""for nothing"" as the university defended allowing banned men to return.UK","This video can not be played The student says she feels her experience has been for nothing A student threatened with rape by men in an online chat has told the BBC her university's investigation into the messages made her feel like she was ""on trial"". Five male students were banned from the University of Warwick last year, after details of the chat emerged. Several students in the chat encouraged others to rape women on campus. The university said it ""stands by the investigation process"", but it planned to review its disciplinary procedures. A statement from the university, accompanying an open letter by vice-chancellor Professor Stuart Croft, said the university ""will ensure sexual misconduct is considered specifically as part of our review of disciplinary processes"". Jennifer - not her real name - spoke out after the BBC reported on Thursday that two of the students, initially banned for 10 years, had had their punishments reduced after an appeal. They could return to classes this year. Rape chat students have bans reduced My disgust at Uni rape chat decision' Jennifer said this left her ""devastated"" and that all of her ""traumatic experiences"" had been ""for nothing"". ""These people are still going to be back and they're still going to be dangerous ... and Warwick University are allowing that to happen."" The Facebook group chat was first reported last summer by Warwick student newspaperThe Boar.,external Jennifer said: ""There were a lot of threats of gang rape. ""One of them spoke about wanting to gang rape me and then after they discarded my body they wanted to ejaculate all over it. ""They talked about my friend, they wanted to genitally mutilate her."" Other posts included a racially offensive term and anti-Semitic language. Student newspapers obtained the screenshots after complaints were made to the university After Jennifer and another student officially complained to the university, both were interviewed as part of the subsequent investigation. ""We were made to feel the entire time that we had to justify why we were upset,"" she said. ""It was very aggressive questioning. It was as if we were on trial. ""We were given a list of male individuals involved, and we were taken through it one by one and asked our sexual history with each of them - which obviously was really traumatic. Not having anyone really there to represent me. ""I didn't know if I was supposed to be answering these kind of questions and it was really upsetting."" The university's director of press, whose job it is to promote the university and protect its reputation, was appointed as the official investigator. Jennifer said that this was a ""clear conflict of interest"". A spokesman from the University of Warwick admitted there was a ""potential for conflict"". But he said: ""During the length of the investigation media relations were delegated to other members of the press and media relations team."" He added: ""All those who were interviewed as part of the investigation were asked about whether there were prior or existing relationships with those also involved. ""The detail of any relationship was neither questioned or explored."" In a lengthy statement,,externalwith afurther list of questions and answers,externalattached, Professor Croft said the punished students' comments had been ""dehumanising, humiliating, and revolting"" and ""against everything that everyone holds dear in any society"". But he said that, despite calls for the 11 individuals involved to be banned from campus, he did not have the authority to make such a decision. He said that the university had a duty of care to all those involved and that he was not going to immediately propose a way forward ""because I think that there is a lot more listening to do first"". In the accompanying FAQs, the university clarified: ""The male students are not allowed on campus at the present time and, should they return to complete their studies next year, their access to campus facilities and to learning opportunities will be carefully managed in line with conditions laid out in the initial punishment."" On Thursday, Prof Christine Ennew, a member of the executive team at Warwick University, said the university was sorry the decision to allow the students back early had ""upset so many members of our own community and beyond"".

This video can not be played Six Nations: George North crosses after Yoann Huget mistake Gatland and defence coach Shaun Edwards are not men to mince their words, so you would safely assume they will have given Wales' players an unflinchingly honest assessment of their performance at half-time. Whatever it is they said, it had the desired effect as Wales emerged for the second half a team transformed. Williams got the ball rolling six minutes after the restart, scampering to the line after Josh Adams had drifted infield from the left wing to make an incisive break. Less than five minutes later, Wales had cut the French lead to just two points. With a penalty advantage, Hadleigh Parkes tried his luck with a speculative grubber kick which looked like a simple one to gather but Huget inexplicably dithered and dropped the ball, which North then smartly picked up and dived over in one swift movement. Around the hour mark, Wales made a raft of changes and it was one of those introduced at that point, Dan Biggar, who gave them the lead for the first time, his nerveless penalty sailing over from 40 yards. France were not done, though. After pulverising a Welsh scrum, Les Bleus were awarded a penalty in front of the posts which Camille Lopez sent over to regain the lead and set up a tense final 10 minutes. The hosts had wrestled momentum back but, just as it looked like they were about to strengthen their grip on the game, they pressed the self-destruct button again as Vahaamahina's brainless long pass was intercepted by North. This video can not be played 'Brilliant' North crosses for second try as Wales gain five-point lead France had been in a rut having won just one of their previous seven matches, and their miserable autumn campaign was rounded off with a home defeat against Fiji. Head coach Jacques Brunel sought to arrest that slump with some bold selections, replacing the experienced and exceptionally bulky centre Mathieu Bastareaud with 19-year-old debutant Romain Ntamack, son of former France wing Emile Ntamack. If Bastareaud's surprising omission from the matchday squad meant a little less weight among the backs, there was no shortage of ballast in a pack of forwards weighing close to 20 stone each. The intention was clear: France were looking to outmuscle Wales. They did that initially, and then some. Les Bleus were quicker and smarter than their lacklustre opponents and, as well as the brawn of the pack, they had the brains of their backs - with Parra marshalling the side from scrum-half. While much of the pre-match attention was focused on new faces such as Ntamack and debutant lock Paul Willemse, it was France's more established players who inspired their first-half domination. Picamoles was prominent in defence and attack and took his try well, as did Huget as he sped to the corner. But then in keeping with their deeply-ingrained tradition of being as erratic as they are talented, France imploded. Huget's fumble was dreadful but, if he was scrambling for excuses, he might have pointed to the difficult conditions that came with the rain. That would have been charitable to allow that as a reason - but there was no excusing Vahaamahina's rush of blood to the head. Even by France's recent standards, it was an act of astounding self-destruction but, for North and Wales, it was an opportunity they grasped with relish.

Celebrities settle phone hacking claims,"Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish were among those to reach settlements with NGN Sir Elton John, Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Mills have settled phone-hacking claims against News Group Newspapers, their lawyers have said. The case involving NGN, publisher of the Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, was due to go to trial next week at the High Court in London. But, on Friday, the trio's solicitors said they had agreed terms with NGN. NGN said ""sincere apologies"" had been offered ""for the distress caused by the invasion of privacy"". ""News Group Newspapers has settled cases relating to voicemail interception at the News of the World which closed in 2011,"" a company spokesman said. They added, however, that NGN made ""no admission of liability"" with regards to ""any allegations of illegal information gathering at the Sun newspaper"". Tennant accepts phone-hacking damages TV stars settle hacking claims Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Mills also settled claims Hamlins, the law firm for the claimants - who also included Sir Elton's husband, David Furnish, and Ms Mills' sister, Fiona - said the claims were ""the fourth trial in the last 18 months which has settled very close to the start of the trial date"". Callum Galbraith, a partner at the firm, said: ""Notwithstanding the settlements and the growing body of evidence, News Group Newspapers Limited continue to refuse to acknowledge that any phone hacking took place at the Sun."" The hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World in 2011 after it emerged that journalists intercepted the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Since then, celebrities including David Tennant, Hugh Grant and Charlotte Church have settled claims against the News of the World over phone-hacking. The News of the World closed inJuly 2011 amid damaging allegations of phone-hacking at the paper, revealed by the Guardian. Journalists hacked into voicemail messages of celebrities by using a default factory-set PIN number. At its time of its closure the Sunday tabloid sold about 2.8 million copies a week, and was famed for its celebrity scoops and sex scandals, earning it the nickname the News of the Screws.
