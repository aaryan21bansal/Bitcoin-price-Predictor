Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Nurse helps 'coronavirus' man who drove into her,"Lucy Duncan works as a mental health nurse with North West Boroughs Healthcare An off-duty nurse has described how she spent five hours in A&E with an elderly man suspected of having coronavirus after he crashed into her car. Lucy Duncan, 24, was driving home from a 12-hour shift at Wigan hospital when her car was hit by another vehicle. She stopped and saw the driver ""slumped over"" the steering wheel and struggling to breathe. The 24-year-old called an ambulance and then went with him to hospital to comfort him. ""The man was so grateful that I stayed with him and kept squeezing my hand and pulling it close to him,"" Ms Duncan said. Her boss has described her as ""a superstar"". Ms Duncan had been returning from her seventh shift in a row at about 19:45 GMT on Thursday when the crash happened in Abram. ""He grabbed my arm and kept apologising, and said he thought he had coronavirus,"" she said. ""He was grey and sweating, and struggling to breathe - he looked really ill."" The man, believed to be in his 70s, told her he had been in isolation for more than a week but had been forced to leave his home to buy food. ""So I called an ambulance and followed him in my own car, and stayed with him for five hours wearing full PPE,"" she said.

""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere.

Virgin Atlantic seeks bailout in coming days,"Virgin Airlines has seen passengers numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Virgin Atlantic is expected to ask for a government bailout worth hundreds of millions of pounds in the coming days, the BBC understands. Requests for state aid are also expected from other airlines. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. However, the Transport Secretary told MPs he can't rule out the state taking an ownership stake in UK airlines that have been battered by coronavirus. Grant Shapps told MPs on the Transport Select Committee that nothing had been ruled out in its response to coronavirus for the aviation sector. Asked by Labour MP Ruth Cadbury if the government would consider buying a share of UK airlines that face collapse, Mr Shapps said: ""It was important to save companies that would survive in normal times. However, the Transport Secretary said current shareholders ""must be part of the solution"". UK-based airlines have already announced measures to save money such astemporarily laying-off staff. Virgin Atlantic had previously suggested the government offer UK carriers Â£7.5 billion in credit facilities. The airline's founder Sir Richard Branson this week offered to inject Â£250 million into the Virgin Group, with most of that amount going to the airline. The vast bulk of flights to and from the UK have beengrounded amid the coronaviruspandemic. Some airlines like British Airways are still operating a number of rescue flights to bring stranded Brits home. Earlier this week, the government said it would not deliver a financial aid package for the aviation industry, but its emergency business measures, including a Bank of England scheme for firms to raise capital and employee wage subsidies, were available for airlines. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it called on governments around the world for help. The US Senate on Wednesday passed a $58 billion (Â£46.6 billion) aid package for its airline industry, which included cash for paying pilot, crew and staff salaries. You'd be forgiven for being confused about whether the government is going to bailout UK-based airlines, or not. First ministers indicated that an industry-wide bailout was on the cards. Virgin Atlantic went public and said Â£7.5bn was needed. But then an about turn from the Chancellor. Rishi Sunak wrote to airlines and airports telling them that an industry-wide emergency rescue package for the aviation industry wasn't on its way after all. What the government is offering is bespoke financial support on a case-by-case basis, but only once airlines have exhausted all other options. Ministers want to be sure that wealthy shareholders play their part. The other reason an industry-wide package didn't happen was because the airlines involved are ultimately rivals and where as some of them were champing at the bit for a government loan, others were against it. The more cash-rich the airline, the less keen on a bailout. And, for some, cash is the immediate problem. Airlines warn they may not survive without bailout No extra help for airlines, chancellor says Flybe's collapse could be 'first of many' airlines Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Trump orders General Motors to make ventilators,"US President Donald Trump has ordered General Motors to make ventilators for coronavirus patients after attacking the car giant's chief executive. He invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Mr Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. The US now has 143,532 cases of the virus, the most in the world. With 2,572 fatalities, America's Covid-19 death toll still lags far behind Italy and China.

This video can not be played Trump says governors should be more ""appreciative"" But on Friday he said in a statement: ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course."" Earlier in the day he took to Twitter to complain that GM had lowered the number of ventilators they had promised to deliver from 40,000 to 6,000 and had wanted ""top dollar"". He also criticised GM chief executive Mary Barra, saying things were ""always a mess"" with her at the helm of the Detroit-based auto manufacture. Allow Twitter content?

GM said on Friday it could build at least 10,000 ventilators per month from April. GM has been working with a Seattle-based medical device manufacturer, Ventec Life Systems, to build ventilators at the car maker's plant in Kokomo, Indiana. GM's factory in Warren, Michigan, will be used to make surgical masks, the Associated Press reports. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The White House had been due to announce the joint venture between the two companies on Wednesday until Trump administration officials reportedly baulked at the $1bn bill to taxpayers. During the coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, the president said: ""We're not looking to be ripped off on price."" Mr Trump also acknowledged he was ""extremely unhappy"" over the closing of GM's plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The car-maker sold the factory last November, axing 1,400 jobs in a key presidential swing state. The medical machines that keep patients breathing are much in demand amid the respiratory illness' outbreak, which in the most serious cases attacks the lungs. Louisiana's governor said on Friday that New Orleans could run out of ventilators by 2 April. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has estimated that 960,000 intensive care patients will require a ventilator at some point during the US coronavirus outbreak. New York has requested 30,000 ventilators, but Mr Trump said during Friday's briefing he felt that was a ""high"" estimate. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death New York Governor Andrew Cuomo fired back, insisting the request was based on ""facts and on data"". The state remains the epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis in the US, with over 7,000 new cases announced on Friday alone. There are a total of 59,568 patients thus far, and the death toll has climbed to 965. For the first time since the 9/11 attacks, New York City has been preparing makeshift mortuary space, readying refrigerated lorries to help hospitals as the death toll rises. This week governors in Florida, Maryland, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Texas have ordered visitors from the New York area to self-quarantine for at least 14 days upon arrival. The neighbouring state of Connecticut has implored New Yorkers to keep away altogether. On Friday, Rhode Island police began pulling over vehicles with New York registration plates to obtain contact information in order to enforce the mandatory 14-day quarantine. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed A Washington Post poll this week found 48% of Americans approve of the president's work and 46% disapprove - the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term. But former US Vice-President Joe Biden, who looks likely to be Mr Trump's Democratic challenger in the November presidential election, on Friday said Mr Trump had ""ignored the warnings for months"" and ""downplayed"" the threat of the pandemic. ""It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history,"" Mr Biden tweeted.

No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process.

Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here.

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Nurse helps 'coronavirus' man who drove into herOff-duty Lucy Duncan spends five hours in A&E with the elderly stranger after a car crash.,"Lucy Duncan works as a mental health nurse with North West Boroughs Healthcare An off-duty nurse has described how she spent five hours in A&E with an elderly man suspected of having coronavirus after he crashed into her car. Lucy Duncan, 24, was driving home from a 12-hour shift at Wigan hospital when her car was hit by another vehicle. She stopped and saw the driver ""slumped over"" the steering wheel and struggling to breathe. The 24-year-old called an ambulance and then went with him to hospital to comfort him. ""The man was so grateful that I stayed with him and kept squeezing my hand and pulling it close to him,"" Ms Duncan said. Her boss has described her as ""a superstar"". Ms Duncan had been returning from her seventh shift in a row at about 19:45 GMT on Thursday when the crash happened in Abram. ""He grabbed my arm and kept apologising, and said he thought he had coronavirus,"" she said. ""He was grey and sweating, and struggling to breathe - he looked really ill."" The man, believed to be in his 70s, told her he had been in isolation for more than a week but had been forced to leave his home to buy food. ""So I called an ambulance and followed him in my own car, and stayed with him for five hours wearing full PPE,"" she said.

Food wholesalers offer online orders to sell stock,"People stuck at home have a great appetite for home deliveries from their favourite high street shops Food wholesalers are making online home deliveries in response to Covid-19 measures. As bars, restaurants and hotels shutdue to government restrictions, the wholesalers that usually provide them with food and drink, have seen a huge drop in business. But with stock to shift, they are determined to find new customers. Members of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors have seen a 70% decline in trade over the past two weeks, âFood distributors have seen their market disappear overnight,â says chief executive James Bielby. âCompanies have bought in stock, and the vast majority of it is going to waste as they canât sell it, and in a lot of cases they havenât been paid. âThe government doesn't recognise that this part of the supply chain has effectively shut down - wholesalers need access to support or theyâre going to go bust.â But many businesses have already taken matters into their own hands, by offering online home deliveries for individual consumers. London-based butcherHG Walterâs,externalusual clients include Michelin-starred restaurants, retailers like Harrods and hoteliers such as the Savoy and the Dorchester - but theyâve lost hundreds of regular orders in the past two weeks. âBusiness just dropped overnight,â director Adam Heanen, explains. âAt the moment, itâs not about making money, itâs about the company staying alive and keeping our staff.â The butcher has launched an online home delivery service of âsurvival packsâ including fruit, vegetables, vacuum-packed meat and even a make-your-own Patty & Bun burger kit - itâs had thousands of orders over the past few days. The butcher shop had the idea of burger kits - and has had thousands of orders âWe are used to doing 350 deliveries a day, but itâs just on a much smaller scale now,â added Mr Heanen. âWe were able to adapt our website and use our existing drivers and vans.â Mauro Capellazzi, 71-year-old owner ofCafe Deli Wholesale,external, might be self-isolating, but heâs modernised his company and launched a website overnight. âOnline orders are a completely new thing for us but so many people need food now and we need to keep our business,â he says. âItâs our responsibility to do what we can to help people, especially those who canât leave their homes.â Cafe Deli has transformed its business overnight, with bulk orders for a range of goods, including salad cream âIf you're running a food distribution business you have invested in stock, so you have to find somewhere for it to go,"" Peter Backman, a food service consultant says. âHome deliveries represent a large market opportunity, but the orders are small-scale for wholesalers used to delivering 40-tonne loads. âIt works in unprecedented times like these, but won't be sustainable in the long term for many businesses, unless they undergo large restructuring."" Fresh Pastures,externalusually supplies milk to local authorities, schools and businesses across the north of England. In the past 48 hours it has refocused the business, and is now serving dairy produce and bread from its website. Fresh Pastures delivered to schools and businesses, and is now a community resource âAs schools have closed temporarily, so has 97% of our business,â Dawn Carney, managing director, explains. âBut we recognise that we have an opportunity to redistribute our services to offer a vital resource for our communities.â Food delivery apps aimed at chefs are now giving consumers access to their services Food delivery apps are enjoying a spike due to Covid-19 social distancing,offering groceries as well as takeaways. Foodchain is an app developed for chefs and suppliers, catering for around 500 restaurants with produce. Recently, the platform has been adapted to give consumers access to get food boxes delivered to their homes. âWhen my friend was self-isolating, I realised he couldnât get a food delivery for weeks, so I thought we could fill that gap,â Amelia Christie-Miller, of Foodchain, says. In the past two weeks, theyâve had 2,500 new sign-ups, almost entirely home users. âItâs been a challenge adapting to card payments and convincing our suppliers to sell smaller amounts, but it has been really popular,â she adds. Itâs not just food that is adapting to online demand. Many pubs and breweries are offering home deliveries, including pre-mixed cocktails. Allow Twitter content?

People who've lost their jobs in retail and hospitality are being urged to consider becoming carers during the coronavirus outbreak. Social Care Wales said there were ""urgent shortages"" of care workers to help elderly, children and vulnerable people during the pandemic. There are already over 400 jobs advertised on a new website, aimed at attracting people out of work due to bars, pubs, shops and leisure centres being shut down. Chief executive Sue Evans said carers were a ""lifeline for communities"" during the pandemic and many people had transferable skills to be able to work in the sector. ""We need more people with the right skills to help, right now,"" she said. If you have spent seven days in isolation after developing symptoms associated with coronavirus, you might be wondering what precautions you should take now. Alex Akin of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine toldBBC Newsbeatpeople should clean their homes. While you've not been outside, you've been touching things in your house while potentially infected. But, he says, using soapy water or any kind of detergent to wipe down surfaces in the room you've been isolating in is enough to kill droplets of any virus.

Sgt Hamish Nichols, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: âYesterday we turned away numerous caravans and camper vans whose owners were travelling to Pembrokeshire to self-isolate. âWe have also spoken to two campsite owners who have been open for business, and have issued stern advice to them and to all holidaymakers.""

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Brexit: EU-UK meeting to go ahead via video link,"Michael Gove won't be meeting EU officials face-to-face for a while A post-Brexit meeting between the EU and UK will go ahead as planned next week, despite the coronavirus crisis. Much of Europe is on lockdown, so Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove will meet EU officials via video link. The UK and EU's chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier are in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus. Downing Street insisted there would be ""no change"" to its timetable for getting a trade deal done. Under the terms of its withdrawal agreement with the EU, the UK has until the end of the year - during which it will continue to follow most Brussels rules - to reach a deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after first week Full UK-EU trade deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU trade talks The UK has ruled out any deadline extension. But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned it will be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive deal within that timescale. Speaking last month, Mr Gove threatened that the UK could walk away from talks in June if the two sides had not agreed the ""broad outline"" of terms by then. The government also published a30-page document outlining its priorities,externalfor negotiations, The first meeting of the joint UK-EU committee, to discuss the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, is due to take place by video conference on Monday, with Mr Gove facing European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the talks would ""oversee the implementation, application and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement and will seek to resolve any issues that may arise from it"". Mr Johnsonannounced on Fridaythat he had contracted coronavirus but was continuing to work in self-isolation. Brexit happened on 31 January after Mr Johnson's Conservatives won the general election by a landslide. This ended more than three years of Parliamentary dispute and implemented the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of UK voters chose not to stay in the EU.

"Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirusThe health secretary also has the virus, while England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty is showing symptoms, and the number of UK deaths is now 759.","This video can not be played In a video on Twitter, Boris Johnson says he is self-isolating and will continue to work from home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but would continue to lead the government. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had also tested positive while England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Another 181 people died with the virus in the past day,figures showed.,external It takes the total number of UK deaths to 759, with 14,543 confirmed cases. The daily coronavirus news conference was led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, alongside deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths They announced plans to begin a large-scale testing programme of health service staff,starting with critical care teams. It will later be expanded to cover social care staff too. It follows mounting criticism from NHS staff over a lack of testing - currently, only seriously-ill patients in hospital are being tested. Testing will be carried out on staff showing possible symptoms of the virus or staff who live with people who have symptoms - not for all frontline workers as a matter of course. ""This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative,"" Mr Gove said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the announcement was ""long overdue"" and the lack of testing so far had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the frontline,"" BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. Sir Simon Stevens also announced plans for two further field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester,similar to thatbeing readied at the ExCel centre in east London. He said that 33,000 beds - the equivalent of 50 hospitals - had been freed up across England ready for coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Michael Gove announced increased testing capacity for frontline workers The government has imposed strict restrictions on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the virus. However, BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said the UK's daily death toll will still rise into the many hundreds in the coming weeks. This does not mean social distancing measures are not working - but there will be a lag of two to four weeks before we see the effects, our correspondent says. Mr Gove said scientific analysis suggested the rate of infection had been doubling every three to four days, but the ""fantastic"" public response to the restrictions would make a difference. Asked whether the prime minister and health secretary should have been ""better protected"", he said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS,"" he added. Mr Johnson is thought to be the first world leader to announce they have the virus. He was last seen on Thursday night, clapping outside No 10 as part ofa nationwide gesture to thank NHS staffand carers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson, 55, said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus."" The PM chaired a phone call on Friday morning, and later in the day, Downing Street said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump. ""The president wished the prime minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,"" a spokesman said. ""They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic."" How the UK clapped for carers from doorsteps and balconies Mr Hancock said,externalhe was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus, and would be self-isolating until next Thursday. He told BBC Look East it was ""understandable that people will ask the question"" why he and the prime minister were tested, but most people with possible symptoms were not. The health secretary said there was a protocol laid down by the chief medical officer which required a small number of senior figures, key to the national effort, to be tested. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Earlier this week the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The prime minister's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, who is several months pregnant, is also self-isolating, although it is not known if they are still living together. Pregnant women in their third trimesterare advised to be particularly stringent,externalwhen following social distancing advice, and minimise social contact for up to 12 weeks. Maybe it was inevitable. One of the first moments that raised eyebrows in the course of the UK outbreak was when health minister Nadine Dorries came down with coronavirus. Then, last week, we discovered that some key staff in No 10, including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost, were self-isolating with suspected symptoms. A fair number of MPs took themselves off into isolation for fear of having contracted the infection. Their remaining colleagues were continually ordered to sit far apart on the green benches, before finally, this week, Parliament itself closed early, with no certain date for a return of normal business. Still, the news this morning that the prime minister himself has contracted coronavirus felt like a shock. Read more from Laura Neither the PM's senior adviser Dominic Cummings nor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has symptoms. They have not been tested. A Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the Queen, 93, saw Mr Johnson more than two weeks ago on 11 March, and she is in good health. The pair usually meet weekly for the prime minister's audience with the Queen, but the most recent meetings have been over the phone. In other developments: Police forces in England and Wales have fined peoplefor ignoring guidance issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said he expects the number of coronavirus cases to increase over the next two to three weeks, and then start to gradually decrease due to the current lockdown. Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned Londoners there will be ""a large number"" of deathsand temporary mortuaries will be set up across the capital. The Ministry of Justice says 27 prisoners, in 14 prisons, have tested positive. Italian restaurant chain Carluccio's is facing collapse,after warning it is facing permanent branch closures due to coronavirus. The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS has reached 700,000. The government originally set a target of 250,000 but increased it to 750,000 after a huge response. More than 7,000 former nurses and midwiveshave signed up to return to the profession,external. Tesco has saidthat online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on, while supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. The Queen's birthday parade, the Trooping the Colour, will not go ahead in its usual form, and other options are being considered. Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock were seen together and following social distancing advice at PMQs on Wednesday Other world leaders including Canada's Justin Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel have self-isolated after coming into contact with people who have tested positive for the virus. Politicians including Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott shared messages to the PM, wishing him a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Mr Johnson: ""Europe wishes you a speedy recovery."" In the Irish Republic, the Taoiseach,Leo Varadkar, has announced tough new restrictions on movement. From midnight on Friday, for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, everyone must stay at home unless their work is essential or they are buying food.

Virus deaths: What we don't know,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

LiveLiveOver 900 coronavirus deaths in a day in Italy7 minutes ago,"Italy's death toll has risen by more than 900 - believed to be the sharpest hike in fatalities of any country President Trump has signed into law a $2tn stimulus bill to kick-start the coronavirus-hit economy Britain's PM Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus, as has Health Secretary Matt Hancock Testing for frontline UK health workers is to be ramped up next week; the number of deaths in the UK has reached 759 Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians queued for hours at Polish border crossings to beat a midnight deadline Sophie Williams, George Bowden, George Wright, Joshua Nevett, Jim Todd, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Saira Asher, Jay Savage, Frances Mao, Owen Amos and Krutika Pathi That's it for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Brexit: EU-UK meeting to go ahead via video linkThe government insists the coronavirus crisis will not slow its timetable for reaching a trade deal.UK Politics,"Michael Gove won't be meeting EU officials face-to-face for a while A post-Brexit meeting between the EU and UK will go ahead as planned next week, despite the coronavirus crisis. Much of Europe is on lockdown, so Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove will meet EU officials via video link. The UK and EU's chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier are in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus. Downing Street insisted there would be ""no change"" to its timetable for getting a trade deal done. Under the terms of its withdrawal agreement with the EU, the UK has until the end of the year - during which it will continue to follow most Brussels rules - to reach a deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after first week Full UK-EU trade deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU trade talks The UK has ruled out any deadline extension. But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned it will be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive deal within that timescale. Speaking last month, Mr Gove threatened that the UK could walk away from talks in June if the two sides had not agreed the ""broad outline"" of terms by then. The government also published a30-page document outlining its priorities,externalfor negotiations, The first meeting of the joint UK-EU committee, to discuss the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, is due to take place by video conference on Monday, with Mr Gove facing European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the talks would ""oversee the implementation, application and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement and will seek to resolve any issues that may arise from it"". Mr Johnsonannounced on Fridaythat he had contracted coronavirus but was continuing to work in self-isolation. Brexit happened on 31 January after Mr Johnson's Conservatives won the general election by a landslide. This ended more than three years of Parliamentary dispute and implemented the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of UK voters chose not to stay in the EU.

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Deaths rise but Spain's infection rate stabilises,"Spain's health system has been under intense pressure as infections continue to rise Spain has seen a sharp rise in the number of deaths caused by coronavirus but the rate of new infections is stabilising, officials say. Confirmed cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, rose to 64,059, a 14% increase compared with 18% a day earlier and 20% on Wednesday. In 24 hours, 769 people died, a daily record, taking the total to 4,858. Nursing home residents are particularly affected. Spain is Europe's second-worst-hit country after Italy. The Spanish government has extended the state of emergency until at least 12 April. People's movement are severely restricted and most shops and businesses closed. The latest figures raised hopes that the measures were beginning to take effect. Health emergency chief Fernando SimÃ³n said they showed a ""clear stabilisation"" and that it seemed they were ""approaching the long-awaited peak"". Across the country, the army has been deployed to deep-clean hospitals and other facilities - including some 900 nursing homes where at least 1,517 deaths have been recorded. Hospitals have been under intense pressure, and the number of confirmed cases included 9,444 health workers. For days, doctors, nurses and other frontline personnel have complained of inadequate protective equipment. Meanwhile, the health ministry said some 9,000 rapid diagnostic tests imported from China had proved defective. Their use has been suspended, it said.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash On Friday Italy reported 969 new deaths - a record - bringing the total of deaths from Covid-19 in the country to 9,134. The number of cases rose by almost 6,000 to 86,498. The country was the first in the West to impose sweeping restrictions on people's movement and, on Friday, authorities warned they were likely to be extended beyond 3 April. In France, Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe raised the alarm over an ""extremely high wave"" of new infections, saying the epidemic that started in the east was now in the Paris region. Hospitals could reach saturation point around the capital within 24 to 48 hours, the Hospital Federation of France said. Some 1.2 million residents in the Paris area have left in the past week, according to data analysed by mobile phone company Orange. The country had 29,155 confirmed cases and 1,696 deaths as of Thursday. Julie A, 16, became France's youngest victim of the virus, with her sister Manon telling Le Parisien newspaper: ""We've got to stop thinking this only affects the elderly. No-one is invincible against this mutant virus"". ""The EU is finished,"" gloat the naysayers. ""Even faced with the coronavirus, its members can't stick together."" Certainly EU leaders meeting on Thursday - by socially-distant video conference - glaringly failed to agree to share the debt they are all racking up fighting Covid-19. From her flat in Berlin, where she is self-isolating after her doctor tested positive for the virus, German Chancellor Angela Merkel openly admitted to the disharmony over financial instruments. What leaders did agree on was asking Eurogroup finance ministers to explore the subject further, reporting back in two weeks' time. Two weeks. The EU is famous for kicking difficult decisions down the road but in coronavirus terms, with spiralling infection and death rates, two weeks feels like an eternity. For ordinary people, frightened for their health, the safety of their loved ones, worrying about their rent and feeding their family after businesses shut down, the idea that leaders spent six hours squabbling over the wording of their summit conclusions in order to defer a decision over funds, will be incomprehensible.

Rent-to-own firm Brighthouse calls administrators,"Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse is close to collapse, the BBC understands, putting 2,400 jobs at risk. The company is expected to fall into administration on Monday after facing an influx of compensation claims forselling to people who could not repay. Stricter lending rules had put the business under strain long before shops were closed owing to coronavirus. BrightHouse has 200,000 customers and is the largest operator in the rent-to-own sector. Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments for household items, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. Many are on low incomes and find it difficult to access credit from mainstream lenders to pay for fridges, TVs, washing machines and other electrical items. BrightHouse customers, about a third of whom are in work, will continue with payments, even if the company goes into administration. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""Now the company is expected to go into administration, customers need to think if they can manage to make the repayments. ""If their income has fallen because of coronavirus, they should ask for a payment break. And if the item is just too expensive, they should ask for a lower payment arrangement. They may be able to make an affordability complaint and get a refund of the interest they have paid on previous items."" The expected collapse,first reported by Sky News,external, would see 240 shops close unless a buyer is found. 'I paid Â£2,000 for a Â£450 TV' says rent-to-own victim Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector In January, the business said it was under pressure from dealing with mis-selling claims. Alongside many other lenders of high-cost credit, the company was being challenged by people who said they were given credit when they would never have been able to afford the repayments. This came after rules, introduced last year, whichrestricted the cost of rent-to-own, following claims of spiralling debts. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, ruled that interest charged would be capped to as much as the cost of the product. Prices were also controlled, with shops only able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges. Shops were also prevented from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap. Before the rules were brought in, spiralling interest charges meant some rent-to-own consumers had ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops.

Minister defends wait for self-employed bailout,"Many shops and services are shut, affecting millions of sole traders The 10-week wait for rescue grants for the self-employed whose work has dried up amid the coronavirus crisis has been defended by the government. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has outlined plans for the self-employed to receive a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits for three months. But the first payments are not expected until June, by which time many sole traders will be severely stretched. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said implementation was highly complicated. Research among the self-employed suggests that, on average, sole traders have savings that could tide them over for 14 weeks if they go without work. That means many will use up much of that buffer before the first grant arrives. What help will the self-employed get from government? The Coronavirus Self-employment Income Support Scheme,externalwill available for three months in one lump-sum payment, up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. This will benefit millions of people, at a cost to the government of about Â£10bn, but those in line for the help must wait until June. Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast: ""The chancellor was very clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible, we've set a date of June, if we can do it faster we will, but it is a complicated system that we are designing and we want to make sure we get it absolutely right.""

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Some may have to fall back on the benefits system in the meantime, according to business groups. Mike Cherry, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""Unfortunately, for many people whose businesses have completely stopped, the only option left for them is to claim for things like universal credit. ""This is going to be a huge problem for small businesses - if they are only entitled to statutory sick pay, it might not even cover their fixed costs."" Other self-employed people have expressed dismay that they will not be eligible for the support. Many of them have only been self-employed recently, and the assistance requires that they must have completed a tax return to prove their self-employment income. This could mean anyone who has set up since April 2019 will not be eligible and must rely on other support such as the benefits system. Terry Litherland, who supports his wife and three childen will not get financial help under the scheme This includes people such as Terry Litherland, who set up as an electrician eight months ago, after being made redundant from his previous job. ""I went down this path because I thought, if I go self-employed I can get a regular income and I don't have to worry about redundancy again,"" he said. ""I just need to bring money into the house and put food onto the table for the wife and children."" Others who face missing out include: People who work short-term freelance contracts which were paid through a PAYE scheme, but now have no future work. They are, in effect, unemployed and will need to claim benefits Those who have their own business for extra income on top of their paid employment. If their self-employment income is less than their other job, then they will not be eligible for this scheme Those who have set up a limited company and pay themselves a wage and dividends, often on the advice of accountants. They account for about 10% of the self-employed. They may be able to claim via the government's job retention scheme for the wages element of their income, but not the dividend Those whose trading profit is more than Â£50,000 a year The Treasury has stressed that those self-employed people eligible for support will be contacted by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), so do not need to do anything at this stage.

Sports Direct boss 'deeply' sorry for virus blunders,"Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has said he is ""deeply apologetic"" for a series of blunders in the way his chain has reacted to the coronavirus lockdown. The retailer lobbied the government to keep his shops open, arguing they were an ""essential service"", but backed down after a backlash from staff and media. Mr Ashley admitted his request  was ""ill judged and poorly timed"" and said he would ""learn from his mistakes"". The retail tycoon also offered to lend the NHS his delivery trucks. In an open letter, Mr Ashley also admitted the firm's communications to staff and the public were ""poor"". ""I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days. We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future,"" he said.

'Gob-smacking' vision for future UK transport,"People in the UK need to shift from cars to public transport to address the challenge of climate change, the government says. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Public transport and active travel will be the natural first choice for our daily activities. ""We will use our cars less and be able to rely on a convenient, cost-effective and coherent public transport network."" Transport campaigners have been astonished by his comments. They are made in the foreword to the governmentâs De-Carbonising Transport consultation. The document has been quietly published without notifying the media, and the veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen told BBC News: ""Itâs absolutely amazing. ""This makes Grant Shapps the first government minister in the UK to talk about traffic reduction since John Prescott tried (and failed) to achieve this aim in the late 1990s. âThere are some holes in the document, but it suggests that the government really does seem to be taking climate change seriously."" One such hole is aviation. Whilst making it clear that many car drivers will be expected to shift to public transport, walking or cycling if they can - Mr Shappsâ foreword appears to suggest that aviation emissions can be solved through technology. This notion is strongly contested by aviation pollution experts. This video can not be played What is climate change? Mr Shapps said the shift in emphasis away from driving - where possible - could improve people's health, create better places to live and travel in, and also promote clean economic growth. He said: ""We are perfectly placed to seize the economic opportunities that being in the vanguard of this change presents. The faster we act, the greater the benefits. ""Twenty-twenty will be the year we set out the policies and plans needed to tackle transport emissions. This document marks the start of this process."" Stephen Joseph, visiting professor at Hertfordshire University, told BBC News: ""This is utterly gob-smacking. We're still digesting the document, but Grant Shapps' words really do seem to signify a radical change."" The Transport Department has come in for heavy criticism in recent years for failing to cut emissions in line with other departments. Some campaigners say the government needs to start by reducing the sales of big heavy SUVs, which need more fuel than smaller vehicles and create a greater demand for materials â even if they are powered by electricity. When I broke the news of Mr Shapps' comments to former Commons Transport Chair Lilian Greenwood she replied: ""Wow. That's incredibly welcome if the rhetoric matches the reality. ""Right now all our energies are on tackling the coronavirus but when we come out the other side we have an equally serious emergency because emissions from transport have to be tackled if we are serious about turning around the future of the planet for coming generations."" ""It's great if the first choice is to be public transport and active transport - but that does mean the government has to change radically investment.""

Many are on low incomes and find it difficult to access credit from mainstream lenders to pay for fridges, TVs, washing machines and other electrical items. BrightHouse customers, about a third of whom are in work, will continue with payments, even if the company goes into administration. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""Now the company is expected to go into administration, customers need to think if they can manage to make the repayments. ""If their income has fallen because of coronavirus, they should ask for a payment break. And if the item is just too expensive, they should ask for a lower payment arrangement. They may be able to make an affordability complaint and get a refund of the interest they have paid on previous items."" The expected collapse,first reported by Sky News,external, would see 240 shops close unless a buyer is found. 'I paid Â£2,000 for a Â£450 TV' says rent-to-own victim Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector In January, the business said it was under pressure from dealing with mis-selling claims. Alongside many other lenders of high-cost credit, the company was being challenged by people who said they were given credit when they would never have been able to afford the repayments. This came after rules, introduced last year, whichrestricted the cost of rent-to-own, following claims of spiralling debts. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, ruled that interest charged would be capped to as much as the cost of the product. Prices were also controlled, with shops only able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges. Shops were also prevented from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap. Before the rules were brought in, spiralling interest charges meant some rent-to-own consumers had ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops.

Tesco restricts online orders to 80 items each,"Sharon Cranfield says she is terrified about going to the shops Supermarket Tesco has said that online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on. In an email to customers it said that the aim was ""to increase the number of customers we can safely deliver to"". It is the latest move by supermarkets to safeguard people and supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. Tesco has already limited all products to a maximum of three per customer, whether they shop online or in stores. Announcing the latest measure, the retail giant said that online orders already placed were unaffected unless customers make changes to them. Anyone who edits an existing order will become subject to the 80-item limit. Tesco added: ""We're at full capacity for the next few weeks and we ask those who are able to safely come to stores to do so, instead of shopping online. ""This will help us to free up more slots for the more vulnerable."" Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so That view was echoed by Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, who urged healthy people to disregard government advice and shop in person. He told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had ""done their best"" to restrict online orders to those most in need, but any new slots released were ""quickly snapped up"". Mr Walker referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's  call for everyone to use food delivery services wherever possible, saying that demand ""vastly"" exceeded supply. He added: ""I'd actually urge the opposite of the PM, in that, if you are healthy, not in a vulnerable category and adhere to social distancing guidelines, please do shop in store, but make sure you shop responsibly."" A government database of vulnerable shoppers in England will be used by retailers to help prioritise delivery slots during the coronavirus pandemic. Sainsbury's and Waitrose say they will begin writing to people on the list next week. The supermarkets say they are also working hard to secure details for vulnerable people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is concern those most in danger from the virus are going in to stores due to a lack of online shopping slots. People in high-risk households have told the BBC they are struggling to get priority treatment online or in stores. Sharon Cranfield from Tadworth in Surrey says her 19-year-old daughter Jessica is very vulnerable to coronavirus because she has cystic fibrosis, which means she needs an ""athlete-style"" diet of 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day to survive. The government says people should book home deliveries where possible, especially if they share a household with someone who is especially vulnerable to catching the virus. But Sharon has struggled to book an online slot. ""The biggest worry is the lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots,"" she told the BBC. ""For my daughter, it's very scary, because she's in isolation. I'm terrified of going to the shops - I don't want to pick up anything. ""It's so risky and I can't put that risk on my daughter. I just hope they get those delivery slots sorted. ""There's a misconception about the vulnerable being old. A lot of people with cystic fibrosis are children and they can't look after themselves. It's just so stressful. My anxiety levels have gone through the roof."" Norman Philips, aged 68, cares for his wife and his 91-year-old mother, who both have dementia, but he is not old enough to be allowed to shop early. Many supermarkets have started toset aside the first hour of tradingon certain days for the over-70s, but this does not extend to those caring for them. Iceland is among the stores allowing older shoppers to buy food when it is quieter But Mr Philips told the Today programme he was unable to secure a slot for online delivery of his groceries, because the first slot available was two weeks away. Facing a huge surge in demand, online shopping sites have been crashing, temporarily closing, or considerably oversubscribed. As a result, he had to brave huge queues at his local Sainsburyâs. âIâm forced to go mixing with people and then come back to a home which has got someone who is supposed to be being shielded and another, my mum, who is in the high-risk category,â he said. He said he had been told by social services to call the supermarket and get his name on a priority list, but despite waiting on the phone for two-and-a-half hours, he was unable to get through. Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Another shopper, Claire from Orpington, contacted Radio 5 liveâs Wake Up To Money programme to say that although she is disabled, her needs are being overlooked. âI personally am blind and have a serious heart condition which, while it doesn't put me on the list in terms of being immune-suppressed etc, does carry a risk of serious complications should I catch the virus,â she said in a text message. âBut apparently, I and others like me don't count as any kind of priority and as such, we either take our chances that a slot may become available, or risk catching the virus with the added complications if we go out.â Claire added it was difficult for blind people to observe the social distancing guidance of staying two metres away from other people, since they had to be guided round a shop. Supermarkets are asking customers to stay at least two metres away from each other The concerns come as supermarkets struggle to cope with increased demand for their online shopping platforms. Asda and Ocadoâs websites have virtual queues to get into their booking systems. Sainsburyâs chief executive Mike Coupe said that from next week, he would write to vulnerable shoppers on the government list who are already registered with the supermarket and offer them delivery slots. Sainsburyâs says it has already contacted 270,000 vulnerable customers to offer support, but many others have complained that they did not receive an email and could not get through on the phones. Tesco boss Dave Lewis said customers who could get out and shop should do so, leaving delivery slots available for more vulnerable people. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it had begun delivering the first of115,000 promised food parcelsto vulnerable people. So far it has delivered 10,000 of the Â£30 grocery boxes and plans to increase supplies in the coming week. Stuart Rose, chief executive of Ocado, defended his firmâs performance in the face on an âexponentialâ increase in demand. âIf youâve had customers whoâve been regular customers for 10, 15 years, you canât just dump those customers,â he said. âWe have put in place restrictions on how much they can order, how often they can order.â Mr Rose called on shoppers to âshow more restraintâ, saying: âThere is no shortage of food. Nobody will starve.â Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Food wholesalers offer online orders to sell stock Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Brexit: EU-UK talks to go ahead via video link,"Michael Gove won't be meeting EU officials face-to-face for a while A post-Brexit meeting between the EU and UK will go ahead as planned next week, despite the coronavirus crisis. Much of Europe is on lockdown, so Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove will meet EU officials via video link. The UK and EU's chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier are in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus. Downing Street insisted there would be ""no change"" to its timetable for getting a trade deal done. Under the terms of its withdrawal agreement with the EU, the UK has until the end of the year - during which it will continue to follow most Brussels rules - to reach a deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after first week Full UK-EU trade deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU trade talks The UK has ruled out any deadline extension. But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned it will be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive deal within that timescale. Speaking last month, Mr Gove threatened that the UK could walk away from talks in June if the two sides had not agreed the ""broad outline"" of terms by then. The government also published a30-page document outlining its priorities,externalfor negotiations, The first meeting of the joint UK-EU committee, to discuss the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, is due to take place by video conference on Monday, with Mr Gove facing European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the talks would ""oversee the implementation, application and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement and will seek to resolve any issues that may arise from it"". Mr Johnsonannounced on Fridaythat he had contracted coronavirus but was continuing to work in self-isolation. Brexit happened on 31 January after Mr Johnson's Conservatives won the general election by a landslide. This ended more than three years of Parliamentary dispute and implemented the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of UK voters chose not to stay in the EU.

Virus spending shows I was right - Corbyn,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says he ""did everything"" he could to win elections Jeremy Corbyn says the government's response to coronavirus proves he was ""absolutely right"" about public spending at the 2019 general election. The Labour leader told the BBC he had been ""denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford"" to fix social wrongs. But he said he had been vindicated by the vast sums the government was spending on the current crisis. The Tories now realised they had to ""invest in the state"", he added. In an interview with BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Corbyn said that the country had been ""ill-prepared"" for the coronavirus pandemic because of  ""10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system"". Kuenssberg: Departing Corbyn believes he won the fight Corbyn bows out from PMQs with campaigning vow He said the government had been ""shocked"" by the national emergency, as their ""instincts"" were for ""free market economics and the small state"". ""They've now suddenly realised that they have to spend money to invest in the state, as we have always said as a party, and they have come around to a lot of that position."" Mr Corbyn said the government had also failed to realise how many people were in ""insecure"" employment in the UK when they drew up their response to the emergency. But he believed that the pandemic had changed the political landscape forever. ""I think our society and our politics will never be the same again, because we have suddenly realised as a society and a community, we need everybody - and everybody has a contribution to make."" Mr Corbyn has just over a week to go as Labour leader, after four-and-half years in the job. The result of the contest to replace him - between Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy - will be announced on Saturday, 4 April. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he make mistakes during his leadership Mr Corbyn decided to stand down after Labour's heavy defeat in December's general election, which came two years after a narrower defeat at the polls. He said: ""I did everything I possibly could to win both elections and to say to the people of this country, the only way our society can come together is if we're prepared to invest. ""I was denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford, in order to right the social wrongs of this country. ""I didn't think that it would take only three months for me to be proved absolutely right by the amount of money that government is now prepared to put in - and Parliament has just voted through - to deal with the coronavirus crisis. ""So this is a change in our politics, which the coronavirus crisis has actually meant in every country in the world. ""There's suddenly a realisation that we're only as healthy as the safety of our neighbour."" Labour fought the 2019 election on a promise to increase spending on the NHS and other public services and bring rail, water, electricity and broadband into public ownership. Mr Corbyn blamed the party's defeat on divisions over Brexit, which led to a vote at Labour's conference to negotiate a new deal with the EU and then put it to another referendum. That policy ""clearly did not win the election"", Mr Corbyn told Laura Kuenssberg. But he added: ""I did my best to bring people together on the principles that in or out of the EU, we needed to have an investment-led economy, we needed to be anti-austerity."" Asked if his leadership was also to blame, he said he had received ""unprecedented level of abuse from the mainstream media of me personally"", which he said had to be ""factored in"". Reflecting on his time as leader, he said was ""proud"" of Labour's ""hugely expanded membership"" and that he had been able to shift the party towards an ""interventionist"" economic policy and opposition to austerity, as well as its plan for a ""green industrial revolution"". He was ""desperately sad"" about losing the 2019 election, in particular, but he believed the party was making an important contribution to the ""national debate"". Asked if he had made any mistakes as leader, he said: ""Of course! I'm a human. Of course I've made mistakes."" He said he had made appointments to his team that did not ""work out"". ""You give faith in people that don't necessarily return it too well, and you sometimes make judgement mistakes. We all do."" Asked if he had any advice for his successor, he said: ""Spend time listening to people in all parts of the country, travel as much as you can around the country as I have done."" And he urged whoever takes over the reins to ""recognise the strengths and the good in people, and that we can bring about a decent better society in the great traditions of socialism and the Labour Party"".

Medics protective gear guidance 'to be updated',"World Health Organization guidelines currently recommend health staff wear a full gown and visor Guidance for health workers on personal protective equipment is expected to be updated within two days, the BBC has been told. There have been calls for greater clarity on PPE as frontline staff deal with coronavirus. The NHS Confederation says staff feel ""at risk"" of contracting Covid-19 unless they wear PPE for all patients. Documents also show NHS Supply Chain ""hasn't been able to manage"" delivery of the items, such as masks, to them. The Department of Health has not yet confirmed the guidance will be updated. But the prime minister said on Wednesday that he had been ""assured"" stocks of PPE were on the way to NHS staff, and the Army had distributed 7.5 million pieces of equipment in 24 hours. LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Health authorities across the UK say PPE -  which also includes items such as gloves and gowns - should only be worn if patients have suspected symptoms or have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Two GPs who say they have coronavirus symptoms have told the BBC they believe they contracted the virus while seeing patients. Dr Claire Taylor, is self isolating at home with shortness of breath, a cough and a fever. ""I saw patients that were not seen as high risk and yet I've picked up Covid,"" she said. ""We need all medical professionals to be given proper personal protection when they're face-to-face with any patient. I feel very strongly about this."" Dr Claire Taylor believes she contracted coronavirus while working at her GP surgery One GP recently treated a man with a head injury at her north London practice ""who appeared to be intoxicated, and was bleeding from his head"". She said he had no cough and no fever and was sent to hospital. He later tested positive for the coronavirus. The GP now has symptoms but has not been tested herself. Many frontline staff are ""really, really scared"", according to Ruth Rankine, director of primary care at NHS Confederation, the body representing health service trusts. ""When they go in and see a patient... even though they're not displaying symptoms, they may still have the virus"", she said. ""We are seeing increasing numbers of primary care workforce going off sick as a result."" On Wednesday, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) wrote to Health Secretary Matt Hancock to ask if GPs should wear it for all face-to-face consultations. It said patients with the virus but no symptoms could still infect staff. The BBC has obtained documents showing the guidance on PPE is expected to be updated.

According to the latest figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, the US has overtaken China (81,897 cases) and Italy (80,589). But with over 1,300 Covid-19-related fatalities, the US death toll is still behind China (3,296) and Italy (8,215). The grim milestone came as President Donald Trump predicted the nation would get back to work ""pretty quickly"". Asked about thelatest figures,externalat a White House briefing on Thursday afternoon, President Trump said it was ""a tribute to the amount of testing that we're doing"". Vice-President Mike Pence said coronavirus tests were now available in all 50 states and more than 552,000 tests had been conducted nationwide. Trump says US tested more than S Korea - is he right? Mr Trump also cast doubt on the figures coming out of Beijing, telling reporters: ""You don't know what the numbers are in China."" But later, he tweeted that he had had a ""very good conversation"" with China's President Xi Jinping. ""China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!"" President Trump said. Mr Trump has set a much-criticised goal of Easter Sunday, 12 April, for reopening the country.

Mr Trump wrote of a ""long battle ahead"" and said ""robust"" testing protocols might allow some counties to lift their safeguards against the coronavirus. He said the ""new guidelines"" would create low, medium and high risk zones that would allow the government to advise on ""maintaining, increasing, or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place"". Trump knows economic meltdown brings political pain What this crisis reveals about US - and its president On Thursday night, Mr Trump phoned in to Fox News host Sean Hannity's programme and said he believed Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska and parts of Texas could reopen earlier than other states. The plan emerged as new research on Thursday estimated Covid-19-related deaths in the US could top 80,000 over the coming four months - even if people observe strict social distancing. As many as 2,300 patients could be dying every day by April,according to the study,externalfrom the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's School of Medicine. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Inside a Covid-19 intensive care unit The Republican president's get-back-to-work goal found unexpected support on Thursday from a prominent Democrat. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current coronavirus epicentre in the US, said statewide quarantine orders may not have been the best approach to coronavirus. ""Young people then quarantined with older people was probably not the best public health strategy,"" he told a news conference, ""because the younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection."" Mr Cuomo said a better way forward might be a ""get-back-to-work strategy"" in tandem with a public health strategy. Public health experts on the White House task force have demurred when asked about reopening the country by Easter, suggesting the timeline should be ""very flexible"". No. On 16 March, he set a 15-day period to slow down the spread of Covid-19 by urging all Americans to drastically scale back their public interactions. But those guidelines were voluntary and did not amount to a national order. The US Constitution makes clear states have the power for maintaining public order and safety, which scholars say means it is the responsibility of governors to decide when virus-related restrictions get lifted. Currently 21 US states have told residents to stay in their homes or ordered the closure of non-essential businesses in order to contain the pandemic. There were growing fears that Louisiana could become the country's next hotspot, with the governor warning that the state's biggest city, New Orleans, could be out of ventilators by 2 April and potentially out of beds by 7 April. ""It's not conjecture, it's not some flimsy theory,"" John Bel Edwards told a news conference. ""This is what is going to happen.""

"Stay local to exercise, says government","The government has said people should ""stay local"" and not travel unnecessarily for exercise. New advice clarifies that people should use ""open spaces"",externalnear to home, where possible. It follows confusion over whether people could drive somewhere to go walking, running, or cycling. Exercise is one of the few defined reasons that people in the UK are allowed to leave their home during the coronavirus pandemic. Derbyshire Police sparked a heated debate on Twitter this week when it shared drone footage of people walking in the Peak District,external, with a warning that daily exercise should not involve long trips or journeys in the car.

Some Twitter users argued that those in the footage were not in the wrong as they were keeping apart from other people, while others classed driving to places as unnecessary. The prime minister, whohas tested positive for coronavirus, said on Monday thatpeople can take ""one form of exercise a day"",external- either on their own or with people they live with. The government'sofficial guidelines list running, walking and cycling,externalas examples. But the initial guidelines did not advise if, or how far, people could travel in order to exercise. While the new advice does go further, it does not explicitly define what counts as ""local"", and whether or not people can use cars. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

His house is a short cycle away, but a busy road means that he is unable to take his five-year-old with him. ""I don't want him riding up and down the main road outside our house, he's not quite ready for that yet,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Do you want to say my Coronavirus contribution was a fine?' - police warning ""But I know if I put his bike in the boot of my car and drive for half a mile, there are lots of countryside trails where he can ride safely along with me."" The RAC said before the release of the latest goverment advice that people shouldn't drive places to exercise,external, recommending instead that they use their gardens - where possible - or leave home ""on foot or by bike"". Bakewell Police issued a picture of a note left by a local on a car parked in the Peak District Superintendent Steve Pont, of Derbyshire Police, echoed this advice in an interview with the BBC's Today programme. ""Every time you're out in public, away from your home, there's a possibility you might catch or pass on the virus,"" he said. He added that unnecessary trips in the car or walks along cliff tops could lead to accidents, and put emergency service workers at risk. Mountain Rescue has also urged people to,external""stay local"" and avoid travel ""unless it's essential"". Steve Lyons, 62, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, said that, initially, he could not work out what those people in the video posted by Derbyshire Police were doing wrong. Steve and Karen Lyons usually walk alongside a canal but now opt for walks in town ""In an ideal world you get in the car, you drive to somewhere nice, you go for a walk, and you drive home again,"" he said. ""But there will be instances where somebody gets hurt, somebody injures themselves walking, or a car breaks down... Are you putting people unnecessarily at risk who might have to come and recover you?"" He and his wife usually drive to a spot by a canal to go walking, but are now opting for walks in town instead. He said that even in London it is ""not impossible to get out your front door"" and walk somewhere apart from other people. However, Rose Drew, who is in her 50s and lives in York, said travelling by car enables her to get fresh air with her daughter, who has a disability. Rose Drew: ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible"" She thinks that maintaining a connection with nature is important for environmental and mental health reasons. ""Not everyone can get out to the countryside,"" she said, adding that people who live in cities ""don't want to walk around on concrete"" but might have cars to travel. ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible,"" she added. For Mike, too, exercise in open spaces is important for people's mental and physical health - and he said that staying healthy alleviates pressure on the NHS in its own way. But he thinks the guidance from the government on driving had ""not been as clear as it could be"". ""I think to simply say you cannot drive your car, get out of that car and take a walk seems to be going too far,"" he said. What are the social distancing rules?

Trump knows economic meltdown brings political pain,"The latest US unemployment numbers were predicted to be catastrophic. The actual total, 3.3 million, turned out to be even worse than expected. The record-breaking amount reflects a US economy put into deep-freeze almost overnight. The government-ordered shutdown hasn't just shuttered businesses temporarily, it has vaporised the jobs of millions of Americans - many of whom are the particularly vulnerable hourly service workers who live paycheque to paycheque. The stock market free-fall and early reports of layoffs foreshadowed Thursday's grim news, prompting Congress to craft its largest-ever aid package, which passed the US Senate Wednesday night. The test now will be whether the multi-trillion-dollar relief will do enough, quickly enough, to staunch the bleeding. What's clear at this point, however, is the physical disease that is afflicting tens of thousands of Americans and growing will be accompanied by an economic ailment that adversely affects the lives of millions. Live updates - virus batters US economy Record numbers of Americans file for unemployment Like Congress, the White House has also seen the coming economic tsunami - and what it could portend. Earlier this week, Donald Trump said he was anxious to reopen businesses and get Americans back to work, representing a shift of focus from earlier statements about doing everything possible to stop the spread of the virus. The political reality for Trump is there will be very real consequences for his presidency not only if the US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic continues to mount, but also if the US spirals into a deep recession. While this is uncharted territory, a nation in economic turmoil early in an election year is a serious threat to a president's political hopes. There are few more reliable indicators of ballot-box success or failure than the state of the economy. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed When times are bad, financial hardship becomes a roar that drowns out all other concerns. For the moment, the president has seen a modest rise in his public approval ratings, suggesting the possibility of a rally-around-the-leader effect, as Americans accept hardship in order to overcome an external threat. While there's been nothing quite like this in modern US history, past crises - such as the 1990 Gulf War and the 9/11 attacks - produced ever more marked surges in presidential support. In both cases, however, those numbers eventually dropped, whether due to the long grind of suffering or an economic downturn. George W Bush's numbers after the attack on the World Trade Center and subsequent Iraq War held up long enough for him to win re-election. His father, George HW Bush, whose post-Gulf War glory quickly faded with the onset of a recession, was not so fortunate. Trump's call for the nation to get back to work has been echoed by other conservatives who are more bluntly suggesting that aggressive measures to save American lives may not be worth the extended economic distress they require. What crisis reveals about US and Trump Why is Trump cooling on lockdown strategy? The president's rhetoric sets up a potential conflict in the coming days with many governors, Republican and Democrat, who have the ultimate authority in their states and will be reluctant to ease the restrictions on their populations. The move might allow Trump to deflect some of the blame for the ongoing economic pain, however. ""You should have done it my way"" is a more politically defensible position than ""my way has caused you this pain, but it's worth it"". There's also the possibility that some Trump-friendly governors might be inclined to side with the president, setting up sharp divides within the nation between some states that opt for an extended lockdown and others that ease their restrictions. For instance, thegovernor of Mississippi recently issued an order,externalessentially limiting the ability of the state's local officials to impose their own business-closure orders. Trump has also lashed out at a familiar foe, the US press. In a Wednesday night tweet, he accused the ""lamestream media"" of pushing for businesses to remain closed as a way of undermining his re-election hopes. ""The real people want to get back to work ASAP,"" Trump wrote. Who Trump supporters blame for virus 'hysteria' Snapshot of American life under lockdown It's an indication that the coming general election campaign is very much on the president's mind. Already the president's political opponents are sharpening their attacks, sensing a long-term vulnerability on his handling of the viral outbreak. Priorities USA Actions, a liberal group, has begun airing an advert using audio clips of Trump's early dismissiveness of the threat of the virus superimposed over a chart of the growing number of cases in the US. The president's campaign has filed a cease-and-desist letter to remove the spot from the air, noting that one of the quotes suggests Trump called the virus a hoax, when in fact he was referring to media coverage of it. The empty streets of New York tell their own story There is ample evidence of the president downplaying the threat the virus posed in the early days of the outbreak, however. Whether or not the president's lawsuit is successful, if the medical and economic pain continues to grow, there will be similar adverts coming in the days ahead. Three million Americans without jobs - 3m Americans facing desperate times and open to desperate measures - has the potential to be a powerfully destabilising political force. Congress's aid package, with its one-time payments to individuals and expanded unemployment benefits, is aimed at ameliorating some of the economic pain and avoiding massive unrest. If Thursday's job numbers is just the first wave of an economic onslaught, however, it may not nearly be enough. And the president seems to sense this.

Yale happiness course takes off,"This 59-year-old Florida man who is in self-quarantine with coronavirus seems to be enjoying himself With a third of the global population living under lockdown, many are turning to science for the answers on how to be happy in these difficult times. By the evening of 26 March, 1.3 million people were enrolled in a Yale University online course entitled: The Science of Well Being. Studying happiness may not be the first field that pops into your head when you think of science, but there's undeniable public interest - especially since Covid-19 began. From the start of December until 26 March, the number of learners enrolled from the US has shot up 295%, according to Yale. While the US accounts for most of the students, Canada, the UK and India also make the top five. Dozens of the countries and regions where learners come from have more than doubled their enrolment in the same time frame. The enrolment page has over 13m recent views. Professor Laurie Santos, who teaches the course online and on campus, says it was immensely popular when she first offered it to university students too - becoming the largest class ever in Yale's 300-year history. Nearly one quarter of the entire student body was taking it, she told the BBC. Tips for how to stay happy in troubling times Trump knows economic meltdown brings political pain What this crisis reveals about US - and its president ""That made me realise there was really a market for this beyond my campus,"" Prof Santos says. When the online education platform Coursera published a digital version in 2018, it became one of the largest classes there too. ""What's particularly crazy is the last three weeks - from March 2018 to the end of February 2020 we had around 500,000 learners, but just in the last three weeks we've more than doubled that."" ""We had 300,000 [enrol] over the weekend,"" she adds, with students coming from all walks of life, from healthcare providers to prison workers. The surge of new students may be due to our instinct to look for solutions and ways to take control in times of crisis - as well as thanks to the extra time those stuck indoors now have. ""[It's] an act of taking agency over your mental health, and doing so in an evidence-based way,"" Prof Santos says. A mother and her two sons have fun despite the pandemic, at their apartment in Boston, Massachusetts Neuroscientist Emiliana Simon-Thomas co-teaches an edX course on the science of happiness which has been taken by over half a million students globally - here are her top three tips: 1. Mindfulness ""Just taking five minutes to notice the sensation in your body, the sensations around you...really grounding in the moment you're in, trying not to surrender to the constant looking forward and backward."" 2. Connect with others ""Spending time deliberately talking with others about your experience, their experience, and if you can, what's going well. It's impossible not to feel worried, but can you ask someone - what did you enjoy today? Was it the hot water in your shower? A particularly interesting conversation or some video you watched that was really moving or inspiring?"" 3. Practise gratitude ""Deliberately writing down on a given day what has gone well and who played a hand in that. Sometimes it's not your spouse or your neighbor but someone you don't know, who might have harvested the fruit that you eat. Really delving into our sense of common humanity in this time is important and a way to recognise [our] potential to overcome this challenge as a community."" So how does it work? While it can seem odd to take a scientific approach to happiness, the general study process is straightforward: researchers survey happy people, study their behaviours and test whether unhappy people can improve their wellbeing by doing the same. Essentially, many of our base conceptions of what makes us happy are incorrect, Prof Santos explains. ""We think it comes from our circumstances, the amount of money we get, our material possessions. My college students think perfect grades equals happiness. But what the research shows is that's simply not the case."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed Teaching happiness then means teaching people to not ""double down on bad theories"". In this pandemic, she says, that could be thinking you need to buy, say, new furniture to feel happy - and when that doesn't work, deciding you just need to buy a better item. ""We're in some sense correcting people's intuitions about the kinds of things that really make for a good life."" Then, it's up to the learners to put those things into practice. ""We try to help a bit about that - all the homework in the class is doing these interventions we know improve wellbeing."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Neuroscientist Emiliana Simon-Thomas, the Science Director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, says: ""The biggest problem with this crisis is that it's so uncertain."" Our nervous systems are evolutionarily designed to find patterns in our environments and create associations, she explains, but with a rapidly evolving situation like Covid-19, it's impossible to satisfy that urge. People in these situations tend to either look backwards for solutions or ruminate about possible futures: Will I go back to work? Will I be able to afford getting sick? Can I support my family if they get sick? ""While both those abilities are very adaptive in solving immediate problems or challenges or an immediate threat, they're very harmful in situations like the one we're in the middle of where the threat is ambiguous, the duration is unknown."" This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat This pandemic is particularly challenging as many of the ways people might normally cope with uncertainty and anxiety - like visiting a parent or going to the pub with friends - are off the table over physical health concerns. So what does improved well-being look like in this new locked down landscape? ""The good news is this is not the flu of 1918,"" Prof Santos says. ""We have technology that can allow us to connect with people - maybe not in real life but in real time. We can see expressions, hear them laugh, be present in people's lives."" She suggests finding ways to do so in informal ways, like video-calling a loved one while making dinner, since those quotidian interactions are often what we miss in isolation. Throughout this global crisis, people have come together, finding ways to connect despite the barriers of quarantines and distancing. Videos of Italians singing together on their balconies went viral in recent weeks. Stories of socially-distanced family celebrations are also making headlines. ""Different ways of framing things can be really powerful in terms of affecting our emotions as we plan for and deal with this crisis,"" Prof Santos adds. ""Despite how anxious all this feels, we get to control our narrative and framing of this crisis - we can think of it as an awful situation or we can think of it as a challenge that our families are facing together.""

What this crisis reveals about US,"The usually packed Times Square is empty There are no fresh flowers at the 9/11 Memorial any more. An American altar usually decorated with roses, carnations and postcard-sized Stars and Stripes is sequestered behind a makeshift plastic railing. Broadway, the ""Great White Way"", is dark. The subway system is a ghost train. Staten Island ferries keep cutting through the choppy waters of New York harbour, passing Lady Liberty on the way in and out of Lower Manhattan, but hardly any passengers are on board. Times Square, normally such a roiling mass, is almost devoid of people. In the midst of this planetary pandemic, nobody wants to meet any more at the ""Crossroads of the World"". A city known for its infectious energy, a city that likes to boast it never even has to sleep, has been forced into hibernation. With more cases than any other American conurbation, this city is once again Ground Zero, a term no New Yorker ever wanted applied here again. With manic suddenness, our world has been turned upside down, just as it was on September 11th. Nations, like individuals, reveal themselves at times of crisis. In emergencies of this immense magnitude, it soon becomes evident whether a sitting president is equal to the moment. So what have we learnt about the United States as it confronts this national and global catastrophe? Will lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have been in a form of legislative lockdown for years now, a paralysis borne of partisanship, rise to the challenge? And what of the man who now sits behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, who has cloaked himself in the mantle of ""wartime president""? Of the three questions, the last one is the least interesting, largely because Donald Trump's response has been so predictable. He has not changed. He has not grown. He has not admitted errors. He has shown little humility. Instead, his critics say, all the hallmarks of his presidency have been on agitated display: his boasts - he has awarded himself a 10 out of 10 for his handling of the crisis. The politicisation of what should be the apolitical - he toured the Centers for Disease Control wearing a campaign cap emblazoned with the slogan ""Keep America Great"". His truth-twisting: he now claims to have fully appreciated the scale of the pandemic early on, despite dismissing and downplaying the threat for weeks. His attacks on the ""fake news"" media, including a personal assault on a White House reporter who asked what was his message to frightened Americans: ""I tell them you are a terrible reporter."" His mocking of Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican who voted at the end of the impeachment trial for his removal from office, for going into isolation. This video can not be played ""Every one of these doctors said: 'How do you know so much about this?'"" His continued attacks on government institutions in the forefront of confronting the crisis - ""the Deep State Department"" is how he described the State Department from his presidential podium the morning after it issued its most extreme travel advisory urging Americans to refrain from all international travel. His obsession with ratings, or in this instance, confirmed case numbers - he stopped a cruise ship docking on the West Coast, noting: ""I like the numbers where they are.  I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault."" His compulsion for hype - declaring the combination of hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin ""one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine,"" even as medical officials warn against offering false hope. His lack of empathy. Rather than soothing words for relatives of those who have died, or words of encouragement and appreciation for those in the medical trenches, Trump's daily White House briefings commonly start with a shower of self-congratulation. After Trump has spoken, Mike Pence, his loyal deputy, usually delivers a paean of praise to the president. His appeal to xenophobia that has always been the sine qua non of his political business model - repeatedly he describes the disease as the ""Chinese virus"". Just as he scapegoated China and Mexican immigrants for decimating America's industrial heartland ahead of the 2016 presidential election, he is blaming Beijing for the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to win re-election. Trump and the 'Chinese virus' Why Trump is cooling on lockdown strategy My judgement is that his attempt at economic stewardship has been more convincing than his mastery of public health. A lesson from financial shocks of the past, most notably the meltdown in 2008, is to ""go big"" early on. That he has tried to do. But here, as well, there are shades of his showman self. He seems to have rounded on the initial figure of a trillion dollars for the stimulus package because it sounds like such a gargantuan number - a fiscal eighth wonder of the world. Trump favours simple solutions to complex problems. He closed America's border to those who had travelled to China, a sensible move in hindsight. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now. It is not well equipped to deal with a public health and economic emergency that will dominate the rest of his presidency, whether he only gets to spend the next 10 months in the White House or another five years. The Trump presidency has so often been about creating favourable optics even in the absence of real progress - his nuclear summitry with the North Korean despot Kim Jong-un offers a case in point. But such tactics do not work as well in a national emergency. What have we learnt of the United States? First of all, we have seen the enduring goodness of this country. As with 9/11, we have marvelled at the selflessness and bravery of its first responders - the nurses, doctors, medical support staff and ambulance drivers who have turned up to the work with the same sense of public spiritedness shown by the firefighters who rushed towards the flaming Twin Towers. We've witnessed the ingenuity and creativity of schools that have transitioned to remote, online teaching without missing a beat.  We've seen a can-do spirit that has kept stores open, shelves stocked and food being delivered. In other words, most Americans have shown precisely the same virtues we have seen in every country brought to a halt by the virus. As for the American exceptionalism on display, much of it has been of the negative kind that makes it hard not to put head in hands. The lines outside gun stores. The spike in online sales of firearms - Ammo.com has seen a 70% increase in sales. The panic buying of AR-15s. Some Christian fundamentalists have rejected the epidemiology of this pandemic. To prove there was no virus, a pastor in Arkansas boasted his parishioners were prepared to lick the floor of his church. Once again, those who live in developed nations have been left to ponder why the world's richest country does not have a system of universal healthcare. Ten years after the passage of Obamacare, more than 26 million Americans do not have health insurance. Three reasons the US is more at risk What can the West learn from Asia's coronavirus fight? Rather than a coming together, the crisis has demonstrated how for decades Americans have conducted a political version of social distancing: the herd-like clustering of conservatives and liberals into like-minded communities caused by the allergic reaction to compatriots holding opposing political views. Once again, we have seen the familiar two Americas divide, the usual knee-jerk tribalism. Republicans have been twice as likely as Democrats to view coronavirus coverage as exaggerated. Three-quarters of Republicans say they trust the information coming from the president, whereas the figure among Democrats is just 8%. As the Reverend Josh King told the Washington Post despairingly: ""In your more politically conservative regions, closing is not interpreted as caring for you. It's interpreted as liberalism."" Even on 13 March, when the CDC projected that up to 214 millions could be infected, Sean Davis, the co-founder of the right-wing website, The Federalist, tweeted: ""Corporate political media hate you, they hate the country, and they will stop at nothing to reclaim power to rule over you. If that means destroying the economy via a panic they helped incite, all while running interference for the communist country that started it, so be it."" The latest Gallup polling shows the split: 94% of Republicans approve of his handling of the crisis, compared with 27% of Democrats. But overall, six out of ten Americans approve, pushing his approval rating up again to 49%, matching the highest score of his presidency. As with previous crises, such as 9/11, Americans tend to rally around the presidency, although Donald Trump remains a deeply polarising figure. After the attacks of September 11th, George W Bush's approval rating was over 90. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The political geography of America, with its red and blue state separatism, has even affected how voters are being physically exposed to the virus. Democrats tend to congregate in the cities, whose dense populations have made them hotspots. Republicans tend to live in more sparsely populated rural areas, which so far have not been so badly hit. Thus, the polarisation continues amidst the pandemic. Rather than to the Trump White House, much of ""Blue America"" has looked for leadership to its state capitals: Democratic governors such as Andrew Cuomo in New York (who Trump tweeted should ""do more""), Gavin Newsom in California (whom Trump has praised) and Jay Inslee in Washington state (whom the president called a ""snake"" during his visit to the CDC). For American liberals, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the subversive hero of the hour. Offering an antidote to this post-truth presidency, Fauci sticks to scientific facts. After repeatedly contradicting Donald Trump over the seriousness of the outbreak, he is on his way to being viewed with the same affection and reverence as the liberal Supreme Court jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Fauci has become a phenomenon on social media Surely the coronavirus outbreak will eventually lead to an end momentarily to the gridlock on Capitol Hill. Legislators have no other choice but to legislate given the enormity of the economic crisis and the spectre of a 21st Century Great Depression. However, the first two attempts to pass a stimulus package failed amidst the usual partisan acrimony and brinksmanship. Republicans and Democrats are arguing over whether to include expansions of paid leave and unemployment benefits, and what the Democrats are calling a slush fund for corporate America that could be open to abuse. Once again, Capitol Hill's dysfunction has been shown to be both systemic and endemic. Given the scale of the public health and economic crisis, the hope would be of a return to the patriotic bipartisanship that prevailed during much of the Fifties and early Sixties, which produced some of the major post-war reforms such as the construction of the interstate highway system and the landmark civil rights acts. History, after all, shows that US politicians co-operate most effectively in the face of a common enemy, whether it was the Soviet Union during the Cold War or al-Qaeda in the initial months after 9/11. This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds But the early response of lawmakers on Capitol Hill is far from encouraging. And if there is cross-party co-operation - as there will surely be in the end - it will not be the product of patriotic bipartisanship but rather freak-out bipartisanship, the legislative equivalent of panic buying. The paradox here, as lawmakers face-off, is that crises erase philosophical lines. As in 2008, ideological conservatives have overnight become operational liberals. Those who ordinarily detest government have come in this emergency to depend on it. Corporate America, which is generally phobic towards federal intervention, is now desperate for government bailouts. Trickle-down supply siders have become Keynesian big spenders, such is their desire for government stimulus spending funded by the taxpayer. Even universal basic income, a fringe idea popularised by the Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, has gone mainstream. The US government intends to give $1,200 payments to every American. In this call to national action, we have been reminded of how the federal government has been run down over the past 40 years partly because of an anti-government onslaught that started with Ronald Reagan. In 2018, the team responsible for pandemic response on the National Security Council at the White House was disbanded. The failure to carry out adequate testing, the key to containing outbreaks early on, is linked to a funding shortfall at the Department of Health and Human Services. As with the attacks of 11 September 2001, warnings within government were repeatedly ignored. In recent years, there have been numerous exercises to test the country's preparedness for a pandemic - one of which involved a respiratory virus originating from China - that identified exactly the areas of vulnerability now being exposed. As with Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has struggled. As ever, there are tensions between federal agencies and the states. The institutional decline of government that led so many Americans to pin their faith in an individual, Donald Trump, is again plain to see, whether in the shortage of masks and protective gowns or the dearth of early testing. Consequently, America's claim to global pre-eminence looks less convincing by the day. While in previous crises, the world's most powerful superpower might have mobilised a global response, nobody expects that of the United States anymore. The neo-isolationism of three years of America Firstism has created a geopolitical form of social distancing, and this crisis has reminded us of the oceanic divide that has opened up even with Washington's closest allies. Take the European travel ban, which Trump announced during his Oval Office address to the nation without warning the countries affected. The European Union complained, in an unusually robust public statement, the decision was ""taken unilaterally and without consultation"". Nor has the United States offered a model for how to deal with this crisis. South Korea, with its massive testing programme, and Japan have been exemplars. China, too, has shown the advantages of its authoritarianism system in enforcing a strict lockdown, which is especially worrying when the western liberal order looks so wobbly. Hopefully, nobody will forget how officials in China tried to cover up the virus for weeks and silenced whistleblowers, showing the country's ugly autocratic side even as the outbreak was spreading. But whereas Beijing managed to build a new hospital in just 10 days, the Pentagon will take weeks to move a naval hospital ship from its port in Virginia to New York harbour. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction Politically, there will be so many ramifications. It is worth remembering, for example, that the Tea Party was as much a reaction to what was called the ""big government conservatism"" of George W Bush in response to the financial crisis as it was to the pigmentation of Barack Obama. The official history of the Tea Party movement states it came into existence on 3 October, 2008, when Bush signed into law TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Programme which saved the failing banks. Tea-Partiers viewed that as an unacceptable encroachment of government power. Likewise, it is worth bearing in mind that the two major convulsions of the 21st Century, the destruction of the Twin Towers and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, both ended up having a polarising effect on US politics. The fragile bipartisan 9/11 consensus was shattered by the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq. The financial crisis fuelled the rise of the Tea Party and further radicalised the Republican Party. What will be the impact on the presidential election? Judging by the Lazarus-like revival of Joe Biden, the signs are that Democrats are voting for normal. Clearly, a significant majority is not in the mood for the political revolution promised by Bernie Sanders. A 78-year-old whose candidacy was almost derailed in its early stages because he was so tactile looks again like a strong candidate in these socially distant times. The view from Lincoln Memorial across the National Mall in Washington, DC Many Americans are yearning for precisely the kind of empathy and personal warmth that Biden offers. Even before the coronavirus took hold, he had made recovery his theme, a narrative in accord with his life story. Many also want a presidency they could have on in the background. A less histrionic figure in the Oval Office. Soft jazz rather than heavy metal. A return to some kind of normalcy. But who would make any predictions? Only a few weeks ago, when the chaos of the Iowa caucuses seemed like a major story, we were prophesying Biden's political demise. Besides, normalcy is not something we can expect to see for months, maybe even for years. Rather, the coronavirus could dramatically reshape American politics, much like the other massive historical convulsions of the past 100 years. The Great Depression led to the New Deal, and its massive extension of federal power, through welfare programmes such as Social Security. It also made the Democrats, the champions of government, politically dominant. From 1932 onwards, the party won five consecutive presidential elections. World War II, among other social changes, gave impetus to the struggle for black equality, as African-American infantrymen who fought fascism on the same battlefields as white GIs demanded the same menu of civil rights on their return home. The attacks of 11 September made many Americans more wary of mass immigration and religious pluralism. The Great Recession undermined faith in the American Dream. A migrant worker in California in 1937 How America changes as a result of coronavirus will be determined by how America responds. Liberals may be hoping the outbreak will highlight the need for universal healthcare, a New Deal-style revival of government, the return of a more fact-based polity and a stronger response to global warming, another planetary crisis which has the potential to paralyse and overwhelm so much of the world. Conservatives may conclude the private sector rather than government is better equipped to deal with crises, amplifying their anti-government rhetoric, that gun controls should be further relaxed so that Americans can better protect themselves, and that individual liberties should not be constrained by nanny states. Every day on my way to work, I pass the 9/11 memorial where the Twin Towers once stood, and watch people laying their flowers and muttering their quiet prayers. Many is the time I have wondered whether I would ever cover a more world-altering event. As I look out of my window on a quiet and eerie city that feels more like Gotham than New York, I fear we may be confronting it now.

Bob Dylan releases first new music in eight years,"It is unclear whether the song heralds an album of new material from the star Bob Dylan's first new song in eight years is a 17-minute rumination on the 1960s and the assassination of JFK. ""They blew out the brains of the king / Thousands were watching at home and saw the whole thing,"" he sings in the opening minutes of Murder Most Foul. But the visceral account of President Kennedy's murder in 1963 gives way to a rumination on America and music.

It's unclear whether the song is connected to a larger piece of work, but the 78-year-old hasn't released an album of original songs since 2012's Tempest. That record's title track was also an extended song about a historical event, the sinking of the Titanic. Since then, Dylan has released three albums of covers, many of which were originally sung by Frank Sinatra - Shadows in the Night (2015), Fallen Angels (2016) and Triplicate (2017). He has also released new editions of his ongoing Bootleg Series, collecting unreleased studio sessions from his career. The most recent volume focused on the years 1967-69 and his appearances on Johnny Cash's TV show. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Stay local to exercise, says governmentNew advice clarifies that people should use ""open spaces"" close to home when they go out for exercise.UK","The government has said people should ""stay local"" and not travel unnecessarily for exercise. New advice clarifies that people should use ""open spaces"",externalnear to home, where possible. It follows confusion over whether people could drive somewhere to go walking, running, or cycling. Exercise is one of the few defined reasons that people in the UK are allowed to leave their home during the coronavirus pandemic. Derbyshire Police sparked a heated debate on Twitter this week when it shared drone footage of people walking in the Peak District,external, with a warning that daily exercise should not involve long trips or journeys in the car.

Some Twitter users argued that those in the footage were not in the wrong as they were keeping apart from other people, while others classed driving to places as unnecessary. The prime minister, whohas tested positive for coronavirus, said on Monday thatpeople can take ""one form of exercise a day"",external- either on their own or with people they live with. The government'sofficial guidelines list running, walking and cycling,externalas examples. But the initial guidelines did not advise if, or how far, people could travel in order to exercise. While the new advice does go further, it does not explicitly define what counts as ""local"", and whether or not people can use cars. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mike, 53, from Lancashire, had to put the mountain biking festival he usually runs on hold this summer because of the pandemic - but still takes his bike out for rides on the Yorkshire Moors. His house is a short cycle away, but a busy road means that he is unable to take his five-year-old with him. ""I don't want him riding up and down the main road outside our house, he's not quite ready for that yet,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Do you want to say my Coronavirus contribution was a fine?' - police warning ""But I know if I put his bike in the boot of my car and drive for half a mile, there are lots of countryside trails where he can ride safely along with me."" The RAC said before the release of the latest goverment advice that people shouldn't drive places to exercise,external, recommending instead that they use their gardens - where possible - or leave home ""on foot or by bike"". Bakewell Police issued a picture of a note left by a local on a car parked in the Peak District Superintendent Steve Pont, of Derbyshire Police, echoed this advice in an interview with the BBC's Today programme. ""Every time you're out in public, away from your home, there's a possibility you might catch or pass on the virus,"" he said. He added that unnecessary trips in the car or walks along cliff tops could lead to accidents, and put emergency service workers at risk. Mountain Rescue has also urged people to,external""stay local"" and avoid travel ""unless it's essential"". Steve Lyons, 62, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, said that, initially, he could not work out what those people in the video posted by Derbyshire Police were doing wrong. Steve and Karen Lyons usually walk alongside a canal but now opt for walks in town ""In an ideal world you get in the car, you drive to somewhere nice, you go for a walk, and you drive home again,"" he said. ""But there will be instances where somebody gets hurt, somebody injures themselves walking, or a car breaks down... Are you putting people unnecessarily at risk who might have to come and recover you?"" He and his wife usually drive to a spot by a canal to go walking, but are now opting for walks in town instead. He said that even in London it is ""not impossible to get out your front door"" and walk somewhere apart from other people. However, Rose Drew, who is in her 50s and lives in York, said travelling by car enables her to get fresh air with her daughter, who has a disability. Rose Drew: ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible"" She thinks that maintaining a connection with nature is important for environmental and mental health reasons. ""Not everyone can get out to the countryside,"" she said, adding that people who live in cities ""don't want to walk around on concrete"" but might have cars to travel. ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible,"" she added. For Mike, too, exercise in open spaces is important for people's mental and physical health - and he said that staying healthy alleviates pressure on the NHS in its own way. But he thinks the guidance from the government on driving had ""not been as clear as it could be"". ""I think to simply say you cannot drive your car, get out of that car and take a walk seems to be going too far,"" he said. What are the social distancing rules?

Coronavirus: People urged not to move house,"The government has urged people not to move house to try to limit the spread of coronavirus across the UK. Buyers and renters should delay moving while emergency stay-at-home measures are in place, it said. Its comments come amid reports banks are pressing for a full suspension of the UK housing market. Lenders are concerned about the effect of the pandemic on valuations,according to the Financial Times,external. Banks are also worried about granting mortgages during this period of extreme economic uncertainty, the FT said. The government said,externalthat while there ""is no need to pull out of transactions"", ""we all need to ensure we are following guidance to stay at home and away from others at all times"". If a property is vacant, people can continue with the transaction, although they must ensure they are following guidelines with regards to home removals. But if the house is occupied ""we encourage all parties to do all they can to amicably agree alternative dates to move"". Tenants 'should get a rent break' Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Property listings websites say that interest in moving home has slumped amid the coronavirus outbreak. Zoopla said demand in the week to 22 Marchfell 40% from the week before,externaland it predicted housing transactions would drop by up to 60% over the next three months. Meanwhile, it said a ""rapidly increasing"" proportion of sales were falling through, as would-be buyers ""reassess whether to make a big financial decision in these shifting times"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Moving house during a pandemic Geoff Grant, aged 60 and his wife Tanya, aged 52, from Dorset had been hoping to move house on 9 April. However, Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa and the couple face having to pay rent to two landlords if their removal firm changes its mind about helping them move. Mr Grant says there is already an overlap on the leases - the agreement for the new rental property begins on 1 April while the existing one ends on 9 April. ""If the move is delayed we'll have to negotiate with two landlords,"" he says. As it stands, the removal company the couple is using said at the beginning of the week it will still do the job. And while Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa on business, luckily his 20 year-old daughter is home from university to help lug boxes - at a six foot distance from the removers of course. Rival website Rightmove also said the slowdown in the UK housing markethad been ""significant"".,external ""The number of property transactions failing to complete in recent days and likely changes in tenant behaviour following the announcement of the renters' protections by the government may put further pressure on estate and lettings agents,"" it said, referring to the recentban on evictions.,external LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills UK, told the BBC the practical problems of buying and selling properties at the moment would have ""a real impact on transaction levels"". ""There are real difficulties around viewings, getting mortgage valuations done, [and] the conveyancing progress."" ""Whenever we've had a fall in transactions, we've also had a fall in prices - I think 5-10% in a period of low transactional activity. ""We would stand by our five-year forecast of 15% growth over the medium-term. That's because we have low interest rates, low levels of price growth in the run-up to this and a pretty swift response from the government to protect jobs and earnings."" In response to the crisis, UK Finance, which was formerly known as the British Bankers' Association, said lenders would extend mortgage offers for people who were due to move house during the lockdown. ""Current social distancing measures mean many house moves will need to be delayed,"" said UK Finance chief executive Stephen Jones. ""Where people have already exchanged contracts for house purchases and set dates for completion this is likely to be particularly stressful. ""To support these customers at this time, all mortgage lenders are working to find ways to enable customers who have exchanged contracts to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to enable them to move at a later date."" Buying a home is the biggest financial transaction most people will ever make. No one wants to get it wrong. Across the UK buyers are thinking again about whether they should take the plunge and whether they are paying too much. Potential sellers are wondering if it is worth putting a house on the market. So activity has already plummeted. One analysis suggests the number of properties being put up for sale has dropped by two thirds comparing this week to last week and is set to drop further. Now the government is telling us to put off thoughts of moving until the crisis is over. Moves can go ahead, with safeguards on human contact, but only if they are unavoidable or to unoccupied properties. The result may not be a total standstill, but most likely a huge fall in completed sales. Has your house purchase or move been affected by the coronavirus pandemic?

Minister defends wait for self-employed bailoutSome people who fall outside the terms of the rescue grants say their hopes have been dashed.BusinessComments,"Many shops and services are shut, affecting millions of sole traders The 10-week wait for rescue grants for the self-employed whose work has dried up amid the coronavirus crisis has been defended by the government. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has outlined plans for the self-employed to receive a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits for three months. But the first payments are not expected until June, by which time many sole traders will be severely stretched. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said implementation was highly complicated. Research among the self-employed suggests that, on average, sole traders have savings that could tide them over for 14 weeks if they go without work. That means many will use up much of that buffer before the first grant arrives. What help will the self-employed get from government? The Coronavirus Self-employment Income Support Scheme,externalwill available for three months in one lump-sum payment, up to a cap of Â£2,500 a month. This will benefit millions of people, at a cost to the government of about Â£10bn, but those in line for the help must wait until June. Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast: ""The chancellor was very clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible, we've set a date of June, if we can do it faster we will, but it is a complicated system that we are designing and we want to make sure we get it absolutely right.""

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Some may have to fall back on the benefits system in the meantime, according to business groups. Mike Cherry, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""Unfortunately, for many people whose businesses have completely stopped, the only option left for them is to claim for things like universal credit. ""This is going to be a huge problem for small businesses - if they are only entitled to statutory sick pay, it might not even cover their fixed costs."" Other self-employed people have expressed dismay that they will not be eligible for the support. Many of them have only been self-employed recently, and the assistance requires that they must have completed a tax return to prove their self-employment income. This could mean anyone who has set up since April 2019 will not be eligible and must rely on other support such as the benefits system. Terry Litherland, who supports his wife and three childen will not get financial help under the scheme This includes people such as Terry Litherland, who set up as an electrician eight months ago, after being made redundant from his previous job. ""I went down this path because I thought, if I go self-employed I can get a regular income and I don't have to worry about redundancy again,"" he said. ""I just need to bring money into the house and put food onto the table for the wife and children."" Others who face missing out include: People who work short-term freelance contracts which were paid through a PAYE scheme, but now have no future work. They are, in effect, unemployed and will need to claim benefits Those who have their own business for extra income on top of their paid employment. If their self-employment income is less than their other job, then they will not be eligible for this scheme Those who have set up a limited company and pay themselves a wage and dividends, often on the advice of accountants. They account for about 10% of the self-employed. They may be able to claim via the government's job retention scheme for the wages element of their income, but not the dividend Those whose trading profit is more than Â£50,000 a year The Treasury has stressed that those self-employed people eligible for support will be contacted by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), so do not need to do anything at this stage.

Sports Direct boss 'deeply' sorry for virus blundersMike Ashley admits it was a mistake to lobby the government to keep his shops open.Business,"Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has said he is ""deeply apologetic"" for a series of blunders in the way his chain has reacted to the coronavirus lockdown. The retailer lobbied the government to keep his shops open, arguing they were an ""essential service"", but backed down after a backlash from staff and media. Mr Ashley admitted his request  was ""ill judged and poorly timed"" and said he would ""learn from his mistakes"". The retail tycoon also offered to lend the NHS his delivery trucks. In an open letter, Mr Ashley also admitted the firm's communications to staff and the public were ""poor"". ""I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days. We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future,"" he said. Sports Direct U-turns on opening after backlash Off-licences added to list of 'essential' shops The letter marks a change in tone for the billionaire.

Tesco restricts online orders to 80 items eachIt is the latest in a series of measures to safeguard people and supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.BusinessComments,"Sharon Cranfield says she is terrified about going to the shops Supermarket Tesco has said that online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on. In an email to customers it said that the aim was ""to increase the number of customers we can safely deliver to"". It is the latest move by supermarkets to safeguard people and supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. Tesco has already limited all products to a maximum of three per customer, whether they shop online or in stores. Announcing the latest measure, the retail giant said that online orders already placed were unaffected unless customers make changes to them. Anyone who edits an existing order will become subject to the 80-item limit. Tesco added: ""We're at full capacity for the next few weeks and we ask those who are able to safely come to stores to do so, instead of shopping online. ""This will help us to free up more slots for the more vulnerable."" Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so That view was echoed by Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, who urged healthy people to disregard government advice and shop in person. He told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had ""done their best"" to restrict online orders to those most in need, but any new slots released were ""quickly snapped up"". Mr Walker referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's  call for everyone to use food delivery services wherever possible, saying that demand ""vastly"" exceeded supply. He added: ""I'd actually urge the opposite of the PM, in that, if you are healthy, not in a vulnerable category and adhere to social distancing guidelines, please do shop in store, but make sure you shop responsibly."" A government database of vulnerable shoppers in England will be used by retailers to help prioritise delivery slots during the coronavirus pandemic. Sainsbury's and Waitrose say they will begin writing to people on the list next week. The supermarkets say they are also working hard to secure details for vulnerable people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is concern those most in danger from the virus are going in to stores due to a lack of online shopping slots. People in high-risk households have told the BBC they are struggling to get priority treatment online or in stores. Sharon Cranfield from Tadworth in Surrey says her 19-year-old daughter Jessica is very vulnerable to coronavirus because she has cystic fibrosis, which means she needs an ""athlete-style"" diet of 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day to survive. The government says people should book home deliveries where possible, especially if they share a household with someone who is especially vulnerable to catching the virus. But Sharon has struggled to book an online slot. ""The biggest worry is the lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots,"" she told the BBC. ""For my daughter, it's very scary, because she's in isolation. I'm terrified of going to the shops - I don't want to pick up anything. ""It's so risky and I can't put that risk on my daughter. I just hope they get those delivery slots sorted. ""There's a misconception about the vulnerable being old. A lot of people with cystic fibrosis are children and they can't look after themselves. It's just so stressful. My anxiety levels have gone through the roof."" Norman Philips, aged 68, cares for his wife and his 91-year-old mother, who both have dementia, but he is not old enough to be allowed to shop early. Many supermarkets have started toset aside the first hour of tradingon certain days for the over-70s, but this does not extend to those caring for them. Iceland is among the stores allowing older shoppers to buy food when it is quieter But Mr Philips told the Today programme he was unable to secure a slot for online delivery of his groceries, because the first slot available was two weeks away. Facing a huge surge in demand, online shopping sites have been crashing, temporarily closing, or considerably oversubscribed. As a result, he had to brave huge queues at his local Sainsburyâs. âIâm forced to go mixing with people and then come back to a home which has got someone who is supposed to be being shielded and another, my mum, who is in the high-risk category,â he said. He said he had been told by social services to call the supermarket and get his name on a priority list, but despite waiting on the phone for two-and-a-half hours, he was unable to get through. Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Another shopper, Claire from Orpington, contacted Radio 5 liveâs Wake Up To Money programme to say that although she is disabled, her needs are being overlooked. âI personally am blind and have a serious heart condition which, while it doesn't put me on the list in terms of being immune-suppressed etc, does carry a risk of serious complications should I catch the virus,â she said in a text message. âBut apparently, I and others like me don't count as any kind of priority and as such, we either take our chances that a slot may become available, or risk catching the virus with the added complications if we go out.â Claire added it was difficult for blind people to observe the social distancing guidance of staying two metres away from other people, since they had to be guided round a shop. Supermarkets are asking customers to stay at least two metres away from each other The concerns come as supermarkets struggle to cope with increased demand for their online shopping platforms. Asda and Ocadoâs websites have virtual queues to get into their booking systems. Sainsburyâs chief executive Mike Coupe said that from next week, he would write to vulnerable shoppers on the government list who are already registered with the supermarket and offer them delivery slots. Sainsburyâs says it has already contacted 270,000 vulnerable customers to offer support, but many others have complained that they did not receive an email and could not get through on the phones. Tesco boss Dave Lewis said customers who could get out and shop should do so, leaving delivery slots available for more vulnerable people. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it had begun delivering the first of115,000 promised food parcelsto vulnerable people. So far it has delivered 10,000 of the Â£30 grocery boxes and plans to increase supplies in the coming week. Stuart Rose, chief executive of Ocado, defended his firmâs performance in the face on an âexponentialâ increase in demand. âIf youâve had customers whoâve been regular customers for 10, 15 years, you canât just dump those customers,â he said. âWe have put in place restrictions on how much they can order, how often they can order.â Mr Rose called on shoppers to âshow more restraintâ, saying: âThere is no shortage of food. Nobody will starve.â Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Food wholesalers offer online orders to sell stock Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"'Gob-smacking' vision for future UK transportPublic transport and active travel will be the ""natural first choice"", the Transport Secretary says.","People in the UK need to shift from cars to public transport to address the challenge of climate change, the government says. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Public transport and active travel will be the natural first choice for our daily activities. ""We will use our cars less and be able to rely on a convenient, cost-effective and coherent public transport network."" Transport campaigners have been astonished by his comments. They are made in the foreword to the governmentâs De-Carbonising Transport consultation. The document has been quietly published without notifying the media, and the veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen told BBC News: ""Itâs absolutely amazing. ""This makes Grant Shapps the first government minister in the UK to talk about traffic reduction since John Prescott tried (and failed) to achieve this aim in the late 1990s. âThere are some holes in the document, but it suggests that the government really does seem to be taking climate change seriously."" One such hole is aviation. Whilst making it clear that many car drivers will be expected to shift to public transport, walking or cycling if they can - Mr Shappsâ foreword appears to suggest that aviation emissions can be solved through technology. This notion is strongly contested by aviation pollution experts. This video can not be played What is climate change? Mr Shapps said the shift in emphasis away from driving - where possible - could improve people's health, create better places to live and travel in, and also promote clean economic growth. He said: ""We are perfectly placed to seize the economic opportunities that being in the vanguard of this change presents. The faster we act, the greater the benefits. ""Twenty-twenty will be the year we set out the policies and plans needed to tackle transport emissions. This document marks the start of this process."" Stephen Joseph, visiting professor at Hertfordshire University, told BBC News: ""This is utterly gob-smacking. We're still digesting the document, but Grant Shapps' words really do seem to signify a radical change."" The Transport Department has come in for heavy criticism in recent years for failing to cut emissions in line with other departments. Some campaigners say the government needs to start by reducing the sales of big heavy SUVs, which need more fuel than smaller vehicles and create a greater demand for materials â even if they are powered by electricity. When I broke the news of Mr Shapps' comments to former Commons Transport Chair Lilian Greenwood she replied: ""Wow. That's incredibly welcome if the rhetoric matches the reality. ""Right now all our energies are on tackling the coronavirus but when we come out the other side we have an equally serious emergency because emissions from transport have to be tackled if we are serious about turning around the future of the planet for coming generations."" ""It's great if the first choice is to be public transport and active transport - but that does mean the government has to change radically investment.""

"Virus spending shows I was right - CorbynThe government now realises it has to invest in the state, the outgoing Labour leader tells the BBC.UK Politics","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says he ""did everything"" he could to win elections Jeremy Corbyn says the government's response to coronavirus proves he was ""absolutely right"" about public spending at the 2019 general election. The Labour leader told the BBC he had been ""denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford"" to fix social wrongs. But he said he had been vindicated by the vast sums the government was spending on the current crisis. The Tories now realised they had to ""invest in the state"", he added. In an interview with BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Corbyn said that the country had been ""ill-prepared"" for the coronavirus pandemic because of  ""10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system"". Kuenssberg: Departing Corbyn believes he won the fight Corbyn bows out from PMQs with campaigning vow He said the government had been ""shocked"" by the national emergency, as their ""instincts"" were for ""free market economics and the small state"". ""They've now suddenly realised that they have to spend money to invest in the state, as we have always said as a party, and they have come around to a lot of that position."" Mr Corbyn said the government had also failed to realise how many people were in ""insecure"" employment in the UK when they drew up their response to the emergency. But he believed that the pandemic had changed the political landscape forever. ""I think our society and our politics will never be the same again, because we have suddenly realised as a society and a community, we need everybody - and everybody has a contribution to make."" Mr Corbyn has just over a week to go as Labour leader, after four-and-half years in the job. The result of the contest to replace him - between Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy - will be announced on Saturday, 4 April. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he make mistakes during his leadership Mr Corbyn decided to stand down after Labour's heavy defeat in December's general election, which came two years after a narrower defeat at the polls. He said: ""I did everything I possibly could to win both elections and to say to the people of this country, the only way our society can come together is if we're prepared to invest. ""I was denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford, in order to right the social wrongs of this country. ""I didn't think that it would take only three months for me to be proved absolutely right by the amount of money that government is now prepared to put in - and Parliament has just voted through - to deal with the coronavirus crisis. ""So this is a change in our politics, which the coronavirus crisis has actually meant in every country in the world. ""There's suddenly a realisation that we're only as healthy as the safety of our neighbour."" Labour fought the 2019 election on a promise to increase spending on the NHS and other public services and bring rail, water, electricity and broadband into public ownership. Mr Corbyn blamed the party's defeat on divisions over Brexit, which led to a vote at Labour's conference to negotiate a new deal with the EU and then put it to another referendum. That policy ""clearly did not win the election"", Mr Corbyn told Laura Kuenssberg. But he added: ""I did my best to bring people together on the principles that in or out of the EU, we needed to have an investment-led economy, we needed to be anti-austerity."" Asked if his leadership was also to blame, he said he had received ""unprecedented level of abuse from the mainstream media of me personally"", which he said had to be ""factored in"". Reflecting on his time as leader, he said was ""proud"" of Labour's ""hugely expanded membership"" and that he had been able to shift the party towards an ""interventionist"" economic policy and opposition to austerity, as well as its plan for a ""green industrial revolution"". He was ""desperately sad"" about losing the 2019 election, in particular, but he believed the party was making an important contribution to the ""national debate"". Asked if he had made any mistakes as leader, he said: ""Of course! I'm a human. Of course I've made mistakes."" He said he had made appointments to his team that did not ""work out"". ""You give faith in people that don't necessarily return it too well, and you sometimes make judgement mistakes. We all do."" Asked if he had any advice for his successor, he said: ""Spend time listening to people in all parts of the country, travel as much as you can around the country as I have done."" And he urged whoever takes over the reins to ""recognise the strengths and the good in people, and that we can bring about a decent better society in the great traditions of socialism and the Labour Party"".

"Little Mix star on pop, panic attacks and knitting","The singer had just turned 18 when she auditioned for X Factor in 2011 If anyone can lift us out of the gloom, it's Little Mix. Britain's most successful girl band are breaking through the fug of self-isolation with a turbo-charged new single that goes by the self-explanatory title Break Up Song. It was written in a flurry of creativity last year - one of seven songs the band composed in a single day with their go-to writer (and former stockbroker)Camille Purcell. Straight away, it was earmarked as the first single on Little Mix's sixth album, which is also their first since splitting from Simon Cowell's record label, Syco, in 2018. Plans for the album are up in the air after the coronavirus outbreak put recording sessions on hold - but they decided to release Break Up Song anyway, in an attempt to keep their fans happy in uncertain times. Flaws and all: Little Mix rate their photos Jesy Nelson praised for 'inspiring' documentary Little Mix interview: Pop music, X Factor and dog biscuits Singer Perrie Edwards joined us on the phone from her house in London to explain what's going on; and how the split from Syco has given Little Mix permission to go back to their first love: pure, unfiltered, hands-in-the-air pop anthems.

In total, the quartet have sold more than 50 million records worldwide It's immediately recognisable as a classic Little Mix song, but how did it come about? So basically, the story goes like thisâ¦ Sometimes when we do writing sessions you're literally sat there, twiddling your thumbs, doodling on a piece of paper, pretending you're coming up with ideas while you're secretly going on Uber and ordering yourself a car home. Then there's other days when everything is flowing and it feels amazing. And this was one of those days. We went in the studio with Camille, who's like the fifth member of Little Mix, and we wrote about six or seven songs in one day. All completed, polished songs? Well, it was everything from rough ideas to little tiny demos, and one of them was Break Up Song. It was very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it. And we thought, ""This has got to be the first single. Let's just bin everything we thought of doing before and roll with this."" So it wasn't always destined to be the lead single? No, but we played the demo to our label and said, ""This is going to be a smash - we just need to finish it."" And they were going, ""How can you tell it's going to be a hit when it's literally just a verse and the [main] line?"" And we were like, ""Trust us. Let us get a really good demo together, and we'll present it to you and see what you think"". And as soon as we did that, everybody loved it. We felt really proud because it was our baby. I've always wondered how you divide up the singing in the studio. Do you each have specific strengths you play to? Back in the day we used to have a routine about who sang what but, since the last album, it's become almost a free-for-all. Like, I got to the stage where I was like, ""Guys, I really don't want to belt out the big notes and the ad-libs all the time.  I want to sing a verse, or something lower [in pitch] because I like to sing low as well"". So we throw it all over the place now. I think it keeps it more exciting for us and the fans. The band (L-R: Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jesy Edwards, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards) are due to play a stadium tour this summer One of the lines Jesy sings in Break Up Song is: ""I'll be good by myself / I'll find a way to dance without you."" Obviously it was written before the lockdown, but it seems eerily appropriate this week. Exactly! It couldn't have come at a more perfect time. I think it'll uplift everybody at home, just jamming out to it. And, as if by magic, you've just gone viral by dancing with your boyfriend [Liverpool footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] on Instagram... [Laughing] I can't believe that went viral! I don't understand what made it so good. I think it's because you float up the stairs like you're in a 1950s Ginger Rogers film. Aw, I love that. It actually does. But we just did it as a laugh; and then it went massive. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Is that your top tip for isolation, just dancing around the house? Yeah, dancing, keeping yourself busy. I just keep putting fake tan on like I'm going somewhere when I'm not. And I've been knitting a little bit. What have you made? Well, like a grandma, I've knitted a blanket - and it's come in really handy, actually. What does the lockdown mean for Little Mix? You had a tour, festivals, a TV show and an album all due in the next couple of months. I honestly have no idea. I'm praying and hoping that our tour is going to happen. But I'm also putting things into perspective. It sucks for us but it's a global pandemic, so we're just going to go with the flow and do what we can to keep our fans happy whilst quarantining and figure it out after. That's basically what everyone's doing. This is the thing: Everybody's in the same position. We're all in it together. And yet some people still seem to be taking unnecessary risks. It's weird, I don't understand why people don't stay at home, it isn't that hard. It's like people want a sick day at work all the time - but now they're being made to stay at home, they're like, ""Well, I don't want to!"" Little Mix won their second Brit Award, for the single Woman Like Me, in 2019 So what stage is the album at right now? To be fair, it was shaping up very nicely before the whole corona-situation happened. But there's still work to be done. If it was all finished and it was sat there, we'd say, ""Do you know what? Let's get it out,"" but it isn'tâ¦ Your last album, LM5, came out a day after you split from Simon Cowell's record company, but it was still on their label. A lot of fans felt it didn't get the promotion it deserved... What was your perspective? It was a weird time in our careers. There was a lot going on, but it's one of those things. We were proud of the album, we were happy with it and the fans seemed to love it. I think, moving forward with our music, instead of trying to mature our sound and try different genres, we're just going to do what makes us happy - which is pop and feel-good music like Break Up Song. Is that what happened with Syco? You were being pushed in a direction you weren't comfortable with? Hmmm... I think we just wanted to try something new. It was our fifth album and you get to a point where you want to switch up your sound, switch up your look, try different things. You don't want to keep doing the same stuff every day. You're basically in uncharted territory now. Girl groups don't usually last for three albums, let alone six. Thank you, yeah. It is pretty unheard of to do this well for this long, so we are really grateful. I think it's just down to friendship and hard work and dedication. Do you find people underestimate the amount of work you do? Exactly. I think people think we get on stage, we look pretty, and then we insert a memory card into the back of our necks and the performance just happens. I don't think they realise it takes weeks and months of preparation and rehearsal and time and effort. It's not easy being a pop star! Each of the band auditioned for X Factor as a solo act before being put together as a four-piece, initially called Rhythmix What was the diary like before you went on lockdown? It was intense. It's always the same in Little Mix world. Our schedules are normally planned out two years in advance. Wow. I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow, Perrie. Well now neither do I! That must be weird. It's a bittersweet situation. It's quite refreshing but it's also quite daunting because I'm used to having my life planned out for me. But it is quite nice not to think about work for a little while. You wrote a reallypowerful and brave Instagram post,externallast year about your anxiety and panic attacks. How did that affect your ability to be part of the band? It's weird. It affected it in a huge way, but it also didn't affect it at all, if that makes sense? When the panic attacks got bad, I didn't want to leave the house. My mam and Sam, my manager, had to meet at my house to take me to work because I couldn't bear the idea of being in a car on my own. And I've always been really independent. I've always loved my own space. I lived near fields with nothing around me and that was my happy place. Then all of a sudden it slipped and now that's my idea of hell. So I like to be surrounded by people now because I feel like if I was to have a panic attack, it'd be better if I had somebody with me. So it messed up work in the day-to-day sense, but it's never affected being on stage, because performing's what I love to do. That's where I feel most comfortable and the most safe, I suppose. It must be hard, though, to get up on that stage after going through all that stress just to get there. It's the worst thing in the world. It's quite frustrating, 'cos if someone broke their leg, you wouldn't say, ""Oh, just get on stage and perform, you're fine.""  But because you can't see anxiety, it's a mental illness, people don't necessarily believe in it as much. The singer posted this unfiltered photo while discussing her struggles with anxiety Has it subsided at all, or have you worked out ways to cope? Touch wood, the panic attacks have stopped, but anxiety is quite hard to shift, so you've got to try and find coping mechanisms, rather than thinking you'll get rid of it. Therapy has helped; and so has figuring out the things that trigger my anxiety and trying to avoid those situations somehow. And if not, just try to keep calm and breathe. In happier news, you've just passed your driving test, is that right? Yes I did! I never thought in a million years I would pass my test but I absolutely love driving now. It's the best thing ever, What car did you get? It's a big truck! It's huge. It's a beast but I absolutely love it. And do you still play guitar? A little bit - but not as often as I should.  I've got long, natural nails now and I can't play guitar with them. Aren't they useful as guitar picks? No! It's really hard when you're pressing the strings to make the chords because your nails get in the way. So I'm putting beauty before guitar talent here! Have you ever considered doing an acoustic set with the girls? I've thought about it but I don't knowâ¦ I'd be really worried because I'm not that good at it. I can play the basic chords and that's about it. Well, you only need three. That's true! Every single song is basically only three or four chords, so you never know! Right, well I'd better let you get back to that tuna sandwich. Thanks for chatting. Thank you! See you when it's all over. Stay safe!

"Little Mix star on pop, panic attacks and knittingThe singer says Little Mix are going back to ""pure pop"" after splitting with Simon Cowell.Entertainment & Arts","The singer had just turned 18 when she auditioned for X Factor in 2011 If anyone can lift us out of the gloom, it's Little Mix. Britain's most successful girl band are breaking through the fug of self-isolation with a turbo-charged new single that goes by the self-explanatory title Break Up Song. It was written in a flurry of creativity last year - one of seven songs the band composed in a single day with their go-to writer (and former stockbroker)Camille Purcell. Straight away, it was earmarked as the first single on Little Mix's sixth album, which is also their first since splitting from Simon Cowell's record label, Syco, in 2018. Plans for the album are up in the air after the coronavirus outbreak put recording sessions on hold - but they decided to release Break Up Song anyway, in an attempt to keep their fans happy in uncertain times. Flaws and all: Little Mix rate their photos Jesy Nelson praised for 'inspiring' documentary Little Mix interview: Pop music, X Factor and dog biscuits Singer Perrie Edwards joined us on the phone from her house in London to explain what's going on; and how the split from Syco has given Little Mix permission to go back to their first love: pure, unfiltered, hands-in-the-air pop anthems.

I'm in my kitchen making a grilled sandwich. Excellent news. What filling? Well, have you ever heard of [swanky Danish juice bar chain] Joe and the Juice? Yes, there's one next door to the BBC! Well, I'm a little bit obsessed with that because my boyfriend likes it, soâ¦ there's a Tuna sandwich that you get from there, and I'm basically just making my own version of that.

PM tests positive for coronavirus,"This video can not be played In a video on Twitter, Boris Johnson says he is self-isolating and will continue to work from home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but would continue to lead the government. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had also tested positive while England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Another 181 people died with the virus in the past day,figures showed.,external It takes the total number of UK deaths to 759, with 14,543 confirmed cases. The daily coronavirus news conference was led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, alongside deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths They announced plans to begin a large-scale testing programme of health service staff,starting with critical care teams. It will later be expanded to cover social care staff too. It follows mounting criticism from NHS staff over a lack of testing - currently, only seriously-ill patients in hospital are being tested. Testing will be carried out on staff showing possible symptoms of the virus or staff who live with people who have symptoms - not for all frontline workers as a matter of course. ""This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative,"" Mr Gove said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the announcement was ""long overdue"" and the lack of testing so far had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the frontline,"" BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. Sir Simon Stevens also announced plans for two further field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester,similar to thatbeing readied at the ExCel centre in east London. He said that 33,000 beds - the equivalent of 50 hospitals - had been freed up across England ready for coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Michael Gove announced increased testing capacity for frontline workers The government has imposed strict restrictions on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the virus. However, BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said the UK's daily death toll will still rise into the many hundreds in the coming weeks. This does not mean social distancing measures are not working - but there will be a lag of two to four weeks before we see the effects, our correspondent says. Mr Gove said scientific analysis suggested the rate of infection had been doubling every three to four days, but the ""fantastic"" public response to the restrictions would make a difference. Asked whether the prime minister and health secretary should have been ""better protected"", he said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS,"" he added. Mr Johnson is thought to be the first world leader to announce they have the virus. He was last seen on Thursday night, clapping outside No 10 as part ofa nationwide gesture to thank NHS staffand carers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson, 55, said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus."" The PM chaired a phone call on Friday morning, and later in the day, Downing Street said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump. ""The president wished the prime minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,"" a spokesman said. ""They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic."" How the UK clapped for carers from doorsteps and balconies Mr Hancock said,externalhe was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus, and would be self-isolating until next Thursday. He told BBC Look East it was ""understandable that people will ask the question"" why he and the prime minister were tested, but most people with possible symptoms were not. The health secretary said there was a protocol laid down by the chief medical officer which required a small number of senior figures, key to the national effort, to be tested. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Earlier this week the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The prime minister's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, who is several months pregnant, is also self-isolating, although it is not known if they are still living together. Pregnant women in their third trimesterare advised to be particularly stringent,externalwhen following social distancing advice, and minimise social contact for up to 12 weeks. Maybe it was inevitable. One of the first moments that raised eyebrows in the course of the UK outbreak was when health minister Nadine Dorries came down with coronavirus. Then, last week, we discovered that some key staff in No 10, including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost, were self-isolating with suspected symptoms. A fair number of MPs took themselves off into isolation for fear of having contracted the infection. Their remaining colleagues were continually ordered to sit far apart on the green benches, before finally, this week, Parliament itself closed early, with no certain date for a return of normal business. Still, the news this morning that the prime minister himself has contracted coronavirus felt like a shock. Read more from Laura Neither the PM's senior adviser Dominic Cummings nor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has symptoms. They have not been tested. A Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the Queen, 93, saw Mr Johnson more than two weeks ago on 11 March, and she is in good health.

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Hereâs a round-up of the latest news from Europe: There are now more than 300,000 cases of coronavirus in Europe, according to Agence France Presse news agency. Italyrecorded the highest daily coronavirus death toll with 969 fatalities. The countryâs President Sergio Mattarella urged Europe to adopt new measures to confront the virus. âI hope everyone fully understands the seriousness of the threat faced by Europe before it is too late,â he said in a televised address to the nation. Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history. The $2tn (Â£1.7tn) package is designed to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus. Congress passed the legislation earlier today. Here's what it does: Allow Twitter content?

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

"Little Mix star on pop, panic attacks and knittingThe singer says Little Mix are going back to ""pure pop"" after splitting with Simon Cowell.","The singer had just turned 18 when she auditioned for X Factor in 2011 If anyone can lift us out of the gloom, it's Little Mix. Britain's most successful girl band are breaking through the fug of self-isolation with a turbo-charged new single that goes by the self-explanatory title Break Up Song. It was written in a flurry of creativity last year - one of seven songs the band composed in a single day with their go-to writer (and former stockbroker)Camille Purcell. Straight away, it was earmarked as the first single on Little Mix's sixth album, which is also their first since splitting from Simon Cowell's record label, Syco, in 2018. Plans for the album are up in the air after the coronavirus outbreak put recording sessions on hold - but they decided to release Break Up Song anyway, in an attempt to keep their fans happy in uncertain times. Flaws and all: Little Mix rate their photos Jesy Nelson praised for 'inspiring' documentary Little Mix interview: Pop music, X Factor and dog biscuits Singer Perrie Edwards joined us on the phone from her house in London to explain what's going on; and how the split from Syco has given Little Mix permission to go back to their first love: pure, unfiltered, hands-in-the-air pop anthems.

I'm in my kitchen making a grilled sandwich. Excellent news. What filling? Well, have you ever heard of [swanky Danish juice bar chain] Joe and the Juice? Yes, there's one next door to the BBC! Well, I'm a little bit obsessed with that because my boyfriend likes it, soâ¦ there's a Tuna sandwich that you get from there, and I'm basically just making my own version of that. Well, I'm glad we've got all the important stuff out of the way first. Shall we wrap up the interview here? Haha, yeah. Or maybe we should talk about the new single... Oh, alright then. Break Up Song is Little Mix's 24th single. In total, the quartet have sold more than 50 million records worldwide It's immediately recognisable as a classic Little Mix song, but how did it come about? So basically, the story goes like thisâ¦ Sometimes when we do writing sessions you're literally sat there, twiddling your thumbs, doodling on a piece of paper, pretending you're coming up with ideas while you're secretly going on Uber and ordering yourself a car home. Then there's other days when everything is flowing and it feels amazing. And this was one of those days. We went in the studio with Camille, who's like the fifth member of Little Mix, and we wrote about six or seven songs in one day. All completed, polished songs? Well, it was everything from rough ideas to little tiny demos, and one of them was Break Up Song. It was very basic at the time. The beat was all over the place and it was really, really rough - but it just had something about it. And we thought, ""This has got to be the first single. Let's just bin everything we thought of doing before and roll with this."" So it wasn't always destined to be the lead single? No, but we played the demo to our label and said, ""This is going to be a smash - we just need to finish it."" And they were going, ""How can you tell it's going to be a hit when it's literally just a verse and the [main] line?"" And we were like, ""Trust us. Let us get a really good demo together, and we'll present it to you and see what you think"". And as soon as we did that, everybody loved it. We felt really proud because it was our baby. I've always wondered how you divide up the singing in the studio. Do you each have specific strengths you play to? Back in the day we used to have a routine about who sang what but, since the last album, it's become almost a free-for-all. Like, I got to the stage where I was like, ""Guys, I really don't want to belt out the big notes and the ad-libs all the time.  I want to sing a verse, or something lower [in pitch] because I like to sing low as well"". So we throw it all over the place now. I think it keeps it more exciting for us and the fans. The band (L-R: Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jesy Edwards, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards) are due to play a stadium tour this summer One of the lines Jesy sings in Break Up Song is: ""I'll be good by myself / I'll find a way to dance without you."" Obviously it was written before the lockdown, but it seems eerily appropriate this week. Exactly! It couldn't have come at a more perfect time. I think it'll uplift everybody at home, just jamming out to it. And, as if by magic, you've just gone viral by dancing with your boyfriend [Liverpool footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] on Instagram... [Laughing] I can't believe that went viral! I don't understand what made it so good. I think it's because you float up the stairs like you're in a 1950s Ginger Rogers film. Aw, I love that. It actually does. But we just did it as a laugh; and then it went massive. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Is that your top tip for isolation, just dancing around the house? Yeah, dancing, keeping yourself busy. I just keep putting fake tan on like I'm going somewhere when I'm not. And I've been knitting a little bit. What have you made? Well, like a grandma, I've knitted a blanket - and it's come in really handy, actually. What does the lockdown mean for Little Mix? You had a tour, festivals, a TV show and an album all due in the next couple of months. I honestly have no idea. I'm praying and hoping that our tour is going to happen. But I'm also putting things into perspective. It sucks for us but it's a global pandemic, so we're just going to go with the flow and do what we can to keep our fans happy whilst quarantining and figure it out after. That's basically what everyone's doing. This is the thing: Everybody's in the same position. We're all in it together. And yet some people still seem to be taking unnecessary risks. It's weird, I don't understand why people don't stay at home, it isn't that hard. It's like people want a sick day at work all the time - but now they're being made to stay at home, they're like, ""Well, I don't want to!"" Little Mix won their second Brit Award, for the single Woman Like Me, in 2019 So what stage is the album at right now? To be fair, it was shaping up very nicely before the whole corona-situation happened. But there's still work to be done. If it was all finished and it was sat there, we'd say, ""Do you know what? Let's get it out,"" but it isn'tâ¦ Your last album, LM5, came out a day after you split from Simon Cowell's record company, but it was still on their label. A lot of fans felt it didn't get the promotion it deserved... What was your perspective? It was a weird time in our careers. There was a lot going on, but it's one of those things. We were proud of the album, we were happy with it and the fans seemed to love it. I think, moving forward with our music, instead of trying to mature our sound and try different genres, we're just going to do what makes us happy - which is pop and feel-good music like Break Up Song. Is that what happened with Syco? You were being pushed in a direction you weren't comfortable with? Hmmm... I think we just wanted to try something new. It was our fifth album and you get to a point where you want to switch up your sound, switch up your look, try different things. You don't want to keep doing the same stuff every day. You're basically in uncharted territory now. Girl groups don't usually last for three albums, let alone six. Thank you, yeah. It is pretty unheard of to do this well for this long, so we are really grateful. I think it's just down to friendship and hard work and dedication. Do you find people underestimate the amount of work you do? Exactly. I think people think we get on stage, we look pretty, and then we insert a memory card into the back of our necks and the performance just happens. I don't think they realise it takes weeks and months of preparation and rehearsal and time and effort. It's not easy being a pop star! Each of the band auditioned for X Factor as a solo act before being put together as a four-piece, initially called Rhythmix What was the diary like before you went on lockdown? It was intense. It's always the same in Little Mix world. Our schedules are normally planned out two years in advance. Wow. I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow, Perrie. Well now neither do I! That must be weird. It's a bittersweet situation. It's quite refreshing but it's also quite daunting because I'm used to having my life planned out for me. But it is quite nice not to think about work for a little while. You wrote a reallypowerful and brave Instagram post,externallast year about your anxiety and panic attacks. How did that affect your ability to be part of the band? It's weird. It affected it in a huge way, but it also didn't affect it at all, if that makes sense? When the panic attacks got bad, I didn't want to leave the house. My mam and Sam, my manager, had to meet at my house to take me to work because I couldn't bear the idea of being in a car on my own. And I've always been really independent. I've always loved my own space. I lived near fields with nothing around me and that was my happy place. Then all of a sudden it slipped and now that's my idea of hell. So I like to be surrounded by people now because I feel like if I was to have a panic attack, it'd be better if I had somebody with me. So it messed up work in the day-to-day sense, but it's never affected being on stage, because performing's what I love to do. That's where I feel most comfortable and the most safe, I suppose. It must be hard, though, to get up on that stage after going through all that stress just to get there. It's the worst thing in the world. It's quite frustrating, 'cos if someone broke their leg, you wouldn't say, ""Oh, just get on stage and perform, you're fine.""  But because you can't see anxiety, it's a mental illness, people don't necessarily believe in it as much. The singer posted this unfiltered photo while discussing her struggles with anxiety Has it subsided at all, or have you worked out ways to cope? Touch wood, the panic attacks have stopped, but anxiety is quite hard to shift, so you've got to try and find coping mechanisms, rather than thinking you'll get rid of it. Therapy has helped; and so has figuring out the things that trigger my anxiety and trying to avoid those situations somehow. And if not, just try to keep calm and breathe. In happier news, you've just passed your driving test, is that right? Yes I did! I never thought in a million years I would pass my test but I absolutely love driving now. It's the best thing ever, What car did you get? It's a big truck! It's huge. It's a beast but I absolutely love it. And do you still play guitar? A little bit - but not as often as I should.  I've got long, natural nails now and I can't play guitar with them. Aren't they useful as guitar picks? No! It's really hard when you're pressing the strings to make the chords because your nails get in the way. So I'm putting beauty before guitar talent here! Have you ever considered doing an acoustic set with the girls? I've thought about it but I don't knowâ¦ I'd be really worried because I'm not that good at it. I can play the basic chords and that's about it. Well, you only need three. That's true! Every single song is basically only three or four chords, so you never know! Right, well I'd better let you get back to that tuna sandwich. Thanks for chatting. Thank you! See you when it's all over. Stay safe!

Shops to get government list of vulnerable people,"Sharon Cranfield says she is terrified about going to the shops Supermarket Tesco has said that online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on. In an email to customers it said that the aim was ""to increase the number of customers we can safely deliver to"". It is the latest move by supermarkets to safeguard people and supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. Tesco has already limited all products to a maximum of three per customer, whether they shop online or in stores. Announcing the latest measure, the retail giant said that online orders already placed were unaffected unless customers make changes to them. Anyone who edits an existing order will become subject to the 80-item limit. Tesco added: ""We're at full capacity for the next few weeks and we ask those who are able to safely come to stores to do so, instead of shopping online. ""This will help us to free up more slots for the more vulnerable."" Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so That view was echoed by Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, who urged healthy people to disregard government advice and shop in person. He told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had ""done their best"" to restrict online orders to those most in need, but any new slots released were ""quickly snapped up"". Mr Walker referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's  call for everyone to use food delivery services wherever possible, saying that demand ""vastly"" exceeded supply. He added: ""I'd actually urge the opposite of the PM, in that, if you are healthy, not in a vulnerable category and adhere to social distancing guidelines, please do shop in store, but make sure you shop responsibly."" A government database of vulnerable shoppers in England will be used by retailers to help prioritise delivery slots during the coronavirus pandemic. Sainsbury's and Waitrose say they will begin writing to people on the list next week. The supermarkets say they are also working hard to secure details for vulnerable people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is concern those most in danger from the virus are going in to stores due to a lack of online shopping slots. People in high-risk households have told the BBC they are struggling to get priority treatment online or in stores. Sharon Cranfield from Tadworth in Surrey says her 19-year-old daughter Jessica is very vulnerable to coronavirus because she has cystic fibrosis, which means she needs an ""athlete-style"" diet of 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day to survive. The government says people should book home deliveries where possible, especially if they share a household with someone who is especially vulnerable to catching the virus. But Sharon has struggled to book an online slot. ""The biggest worry is the lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots,"" she told the BBC. ""For my daughter, it's very scary, because she's in isolation. I'm terrified of going to the shops - I don't want to pick up anything. ""It's so risky and I can't put that risk on my daughter. I just hope they get those delivery slots sorted. ""There's a misconception about the vulnerable being old. A lot of people with cystic fibrosis are children and they can't look after themselves. It's just so stressful. My anxiety levels have gone through the roof."" Norman Philips, aged 68, cares for his wife and his 91-year-old mother, who both have dementia, but he is not old enough to be allowed to shop early. Many supermarkets have started toset aside the first hour of tradingon certain days for the over-70s, but this does not extend to those caring for them. Iceland is among the stores allowing older shoppers to buy food when it is quieter But Mr Philips told the Today programme he was unable to secure a slot for online delivery of his groceries, because the first slot available was two weeks away. Facing a huge surge in demand, online shopping sites have been crashing, temporarily closing, or considerably oversubscribed. As a result, he had to brave huge queues at his local Sainsburyâs. âIâm forced to go mixing with people and then come back to a home which has got someone who is supposed to be being shielded and another, my mum, who is in the high-risk category,â he said. He said he had been told by social services to call the supermarket and get his name on a priority list, but despite waiting on the phone for two-and-a-half hours, he was unable to get through. Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Another shopper, Claire from Orpington, contacted Radio 5 liveâs Wake Up To Money programme to say that although she is disabled, her needs are being overlooked. âI personally am blind and have a serious heart condition which, while it doesn't put me on the list in terms of being immune-suppressed etc, does carry a risk of serious complications should I catch the virus,â she said in a text message. âBut apparently, I and others like me don't count as any kind of priority and as such, we either take our chances that a slot may become available, or risk catching the virus with the added complications if we go out.â Claire added it was difficult for blind people to observe the social distancing guidance of staying two metres away from other people, since they had to be guided round a shop. Supermarkets are asking customers to stay at least two metres away from each other The concerns come as supermarkets struggle to cope with increased demand for their online shopping platforms. Asda and Ocadoâs websites have virtual queues to get into their booking systems. Sainsburyâs chief executive Mike Coupe said that from next week, he would write to vulnerable shoppers on the government list who are already registered with the supermarket and offer them delivery slots. Sainsburyâs says it has already contacted 270,000 vulnerable customers to offer support, but many others have complained that they did not receive an email and could not get through on the phones. Tesco boss Dave Lewis said customers who could get out and shop should do so, leaving delivery slots available for more vulnerable people. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it had begun delivering the first of115,000 promised food parcelsto vulnerable people. So far it has delivered 10,000 of the Â£30 grocery boxes and plans to increase supplies in the coming week. Stuart Rose, chief executive of Ocado, defended his firmâs performance in the face on an âexponentialâ increase in demand. âIf youâve had customers whoâve been regular customers for 10, 15 years, you canât just dump those customers,â he said. âWe have put in place restrictions on how much they can order, how often they can order.â Mr Rose called on shoppers to âshow more restraintâ, saying: âThere is no shortage of food. Nobody will starve.â Supermarkets limit shoppers as rules tighten Food wholesalers offer online orders to sell stock Morrisons taking on charity shop staff Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Home sales expected to slump 60% in virus lockdown,"The government has urged people not to move house to try to limit the spread of coronavirus across the UK. Buyers and renters should delay moving while emergency stay-at-home measures are in place, it said. Its comments come amid reports banks are pressing for a full suspension of the UK housing market. Lenders are concerned about the effect of the pandemic on valuations,according to the Financial Times,external. Banks are also worried about granting mortgages during this period of extreme economic uncertainty, the FT said. The government said,externalthat while there ""is no need to pull out of transactions"", ""we all need to ensure we are following guidance to stay at home and away from others at all times"". If a property is vacant, people can continue with the transaction, although they must ensure they are following guidelines with regards to home removals. But if the house is occupied ""we encourage all parties to do all they can to amicably agree alternative dates to move"". Tenants 'should get a rent break' Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Property listings websites say that interest in moving home has slumped amid the coronavirus outbreak. Zoopla said demand in the week to 22 Marchfell 40% from the week before,externaland it predicted housing transactions would drop by up to 60% over the next three months. Meanwhile, it said a ""rapidly increasing"" proportion of sales were falling through, as would-be buyers ""reassess whether to make a big financial decision in these shifting times"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Moving house during a pandemic Geoff Grant, aged 60 and his wife Tanya, aged 52, from Dorset had been hoping to move house on 9 April. However, Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa and the couple face having to pay rent to two landlords if their removal firm changes its mind about helping them move. Mr Grant says there is already an overlap on the leases - the agreement for the new rental property begins on 1 April while the existing one ends on 9 April. ""If the move is delayed we'll have to negotiate with two landlords,"" he says. As it stands, the removal company the couple is using said at the beginning of the week it will still do the job. And while Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa on business, luckily his 20 year-old daughter is home from university to help lug boxes - at a six foot distance from the removers of course. Rival website Rightmove also said the slowdown in the UK housing markethad been ""significant"".,external ""The number of property transactions failing to complete in recent days and likely changes in tenant behaviour following the announcement of the renters' protections by the government may put further pressure on estate and lettings agents,"" it said, referring to the recentban on evictions.,external LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills UK, told the BBC the practical problems of buying and selling properties at the moment would have ""a real impact on transaction levels"". ""There are real difficulties around viewings, getting mortgage valuations done, [and] the conveyancing progress."" ""Whenever we've had a fall in transactions, we've also had a fall in prices - I think 5-10% in a period of low transactional activity. ""We would stand by our five-year forecast of 15% growth over the medium-term. That's because we have low interest rates, low levels of price growth in the run-up to this and a pretty swift response from the government to protect jobs and earnings."" In response to the crisis, UK Finance, which was formerly known as the British Bankers' Association, said lenders would extend mortgage offers for people who were due to move house during the lockdown. ""Current social distancing measures mean many house moves will need to be delayed,"" said UK Finance chief executive Stephen Jones. ""Where people have already exchanged contracts for house purchases and set dates for completion this is likely to be particularly stressful. ""To support these customers at this time, all mortgage lenders are working to find ways to enable customers who have exchanged contracts to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to enable them to move at a later date."" Buying a home is the biggest financial transaction most people will ever make. No one wants to get it wrong. Across the UK buyers are thinking again about whether they should take the plunge and whether they are paying too much. Potential sellers are wondering if it is worth putting a house on the market. So activity has already plummeted. One analysis suggests the number of properties being put up for sale has dropped by two thirds comparing this week to last week and is set to drop further. Now the government is telling us to put off thoughts of moving until the crisis is over. Moves can go ahead, with safeguards on human contact, but only if they are unavoidable or to unoccupied properties. The result may not be a total standstill, but most likely a huge fall in completed sales. Has your house purchase or move been affected by the coronavirus pandemic?

China bars foreign visitors as imported cases rise,"A queue at a fever clinic in Hubei province on Friday China has announced a temporary ban on all foreign visitors, even if they have visas or residence permits. The country is also limiting Chinese and foreign airlines to one flight per week, and flights must not be more than 75% full. Although China reported its first locally-transmitted coronavirus case for three days on Friday, almost all its new cases now come from abroad. There were 55 new cases across China on Thursday - 54 of them from overseas. The Chinese Foreign Ministrysaid it was,external""suspending the entry of foreign nationals"" because of the ""rapid spread of Covid-19 across the world"". The suspension applies to people with visas and residence passes, but not to diplomats or those with C visas (usually aircraft crew). People with ""emergency humanitarian needs"" or those working in certain fields can apply for exceptions. Wuhan to ease lockdown as world battles virus US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes Although the rules seem dramatic, many foreign airlines had already stopped flying to China - and a number of cities already had restrictions for arrivals. Last month, for example, Beijing ordered everyone returning to the cityinto a 14-day quarantine. Although the virus emerged in China, it now has fewer cases than the US and fewer deaths than Italy and Spain. There have been 81,340 confirmed cases in China and 3,292 deaths, theNational Health Commission said on Friday,external. In total, 565 of those confirmed cases were classed as ""imported"" - either foreigners coming into China, or returning Chinese nationals. In Hubei - the province where the outbreak began - there were no new confirmed or suspected cases on Thursday.

Asia shares up on multi-trillion dollar stimulus hopes,"Shares in Asia have continued a global stock market rally on hopes global authorities will do more to combat the impact of the coronavirus. On Thursday top US share indexes capped their best three-day gains since the Great Depression. It comes as investors expect the US Congress to pass a massive stimulus package by the end of Saturday. The Group of 20 (G20) major economies has also pledged to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.6%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up by 1.6% and China's Shanghai Composite rose 1%. That followed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both climbing more than 6% on Wall Street, capping their best three-day streaks since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended higher for a second day, up 5.6%. Record number of Americans file for unemployment Asia's 'shining star' heads for virus recession Why orange juice prices are soaring on global markets The rally comes after weeks of stock market volatility, as investors weigh the effect of measures to slow the spread of the virus against actions taken by governments and central banks to ease the impact of disruption to the global economy. This month alone, the Dow has seen the six biggest one-day gains and five biggest one-day losses of its 135 year history. In Washington DC, leaders of the US House of Representatives have said they are determined to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday, or at the very latest on Saturday. The huge impact of the outbreak on the American economy was highlighted on Thursday as official figures showed that almost 3.3 million people registered to claim jobless benefits for the week ended 21 March. That is nearly five times more than the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. Also on Thursday, G20 leaders pledged to inject more than $5 trillion into the world economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and âdo whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic.â Their statement also contained the most conciliatory language on trade expressed by the group in years, promising to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies and other goods across borders and to resolve supply chain disruptions. âThe G20 is committed to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic,â along with the World Health Organization and other international institutions, it said.

South Africa begins three-week coronavirus lockdown,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: South Africa prepares for three-week lockdown South Africa has announced its first deaths from coronavirus infection, and said cases there have passed the 1,000 mark. ""This morning, we South Africans wake up with sad news that we now have our first deaths resulting from Covid-19,"" the health ministry said on Friday. Both deaths took place in hospitals in the southern province of Western Cape. Security forces have begun enforcing a three-week nationwide lockdown in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. All but essential movement is forbidden and both the army and the police are enforcing the measures. Ahead of the midnight deadline there were long queues outside supermarkets as people stocked up on essentials. Â Late on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa visited soldiers before they were deployed from a base in the Soweto township of Johannesburg. ""I send you out to go and defend our people against coronavirus,"" he said, wearing a camouflage uniform. No alcohol, no dog walks - lockdown in South Africa South Africa braces for the worst ""This is unprecedented, not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country, that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy, coronavirus."" Under the terms, food shops are allowed to stay open, but alcohol sales are banned - and Police Minister Bheki Cele urged South Africans to stay sober during the lockdown. Jogging and dog walking are also prohibited. President Cyril Ramaphosa greeted troops prior to their deployment On Friday morning, however, local media showed pictures of busy streets and queues outside supermarkets in the townships - where poverty and the volume of people make social distancing difficult. A day earlier, heavy traffic was reported on the main roads out of Johannesburg, despite a government appeal not to go on long journeys. Â Thousands of people thronged bus stations aiming to escape the city and stay with family in rural areas, raising fears that they could take the virus to older relatives who are retired in farms and villages. Police in Johannesburg had already made arrests in the early hours of Friday The authorities have warned that anyone violating the rules faces six months' imprisonment or a heavy fine. ""If people are not complying, they (the military) may be forced to take extraordinary measures,"" Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula warned. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

UK government unveils aid for self-employed,"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the grant Self-employed workers can apply for a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits to help them cope with the financial impact of coronavirus, the chancellor has announced. The money - up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month - will be paid in a single lump sum, but will not begin to arrive until the start of June at the earliest. Rishi Sunak told the self-employed: ""You have not been forgotten."" Wage subsidies of 80% for salaried employees were announced last week. Shortly after the chancellor spoke, the number of people in the UK who have died with Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus -jumped by more than 100 in a day for the first time. The total now stands at 578. âIâm devastated thereâs no support for meâ What help will the self-employed get? Where is the cash going to come from? Live updates on the coronavirus crisis around the world The government had faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in itsearlier package of economic measures. Mr Sunak said the steps taken so far were ""already making a difference"" but it was right to go further ""in the economic fight against the coronavirus"". Self-employed people will be able to apply for a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to Â£2,500 a month. At least half their income needs to have come from self-employment as registered on the 2018-19 tax return filed in January - anyone who missed the filing deadline has four weeks from now to get it done and still qualify. The scheme is open to those who earn under Â£50,000 a year - up to 3.8 million of the 5 million people registered as self-employed. Unlike the employee scheme, the self-employed can continue to work as they receive support. The money, backdated to March, will arrive directly into people's banks accounts from HMRC, but not until June. The grants will be taxable, and will need to be declared on tax returns by January 2022. Company owners who pay themselves a dividend are not covered. The scheme does not cover people who only became self-employed very recently - the chancellor said they would have to look to the benefits system for support. Coming up with a workable scheme had been ""difficult"", he continued, because the self-employed were a ""diverse population"" and some of them earned a great deal. But in all, the ""fair, targeted and deliverable"" plan would help 95% of people who earn most of their income via self-employment. ""We have not left you behind, we all stand together,"" he added. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick later told the BBC's Question Time that even where self-employed workers were unable to provide full financial records going back three years, the government was urging people to ""give us what they've got and we will work through it with HMRC to see if there's a way to support you"". 'When can I go out?' Social distancing rules explained In Pictures: UK before and after lockdown The Federation of Small Business, which represents many self-employed workers, welcomed the intervention, saying:  ""Although the deal is not perfect, the government has moved a very long way today."" But Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was worried the money would come ""too late for millions"". ""People need support in the coming days and fortnight... there is a real risk that without support until June the self-employed will feel they have to keep working, putting their own and others' health at risk."" Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the government had been too slow to recognise the severity of the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Jeremy Corbyn says government has been ""too slow"" Torsten Bell, from think tank the Resolution Foundation, said the very significant package stood in ""stark contrast"" to the ""much less generous"" support being given to employees who lose their jobs or see their hours cut during the crisis. The Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support scheme is another extraordinary, multi-billion pound support, reflecting the brutal economic impact of a shutdown designed to keep the pandemic in check. In recent days, Treasury ministers appeared to be trying to dampen down expectations, telling MPs it was problematic to establish a fair scheme, and the employee job retention scheme would be the logistical priority. The government wants to set up the scheme to keep employed jobs as the priority first, so the banks will need to be relied on to support many of the self-employed with overdrafts to tide them over until the grant goes into their bank accounts in about 10 weeks' time. The sting in the tail? The chancellor said he can no longer justify, after things get back to normal, that self-employed people pay less tax than the employed. But that is for another day. In the UK, more than 11,600 people have now tested positive for coronavirus - although the actual number of cases is likely to be far higher. The peak of demand for intensive care was expected to come in two to three weeks, but speaking alongside the chancellor at Thursday's briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, refused to be drawn on any predictions. She said the UK was ""only just starting to see a bite in the interventions - the social distancing - that have been put into place"", but things appeared to be ""starting to move in the right direction"". The government has imposed strict controls on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the disease. LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks.

More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history.

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Francerecorded 299 coronavirus related deaths in a day taking its total to 1,995. The government has extended the countryâs lockdown which is now scheduled to end on 15 April at the earliest. On Friday evening, the Eiffel Tower was lit up to thank medical workers. Spainhas recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other country except Italy. The death toll increased overnight by 769 to 4,858. Earlier on Friday, the countryâs government approved measures to prevent employers from using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to fire staff. Belgiumhas extended its lockdown until the end of the Easter holiday break. The country has lost 289 people from Covid-19. And everyone in the Republic ofIrelandhas been told to stay in their homes for the next two weeks. From midnight until Easter Sunday people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs which cannot be done from home, food shopping, social care for family, for farming purposes or for exercise less than 2km (1.2 miles) from their home. All public gatherings are banned and those over the age of 70 must ""cocoon"" in their homes. More Canadians have died from coronavirus than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), federal and provincial authorities said on Friday. More than 4,600 people have now been diagnosed with coronavirus across the country, and 54 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sars killed 44 Canadians in 2003, according to government data. Like coronavirus,Sars began in China in 2002,externalbut spread around the world, infecting about 8,000 people. It found a foothold in Canada, with Toronto its epicentre. Public health authorities quarantined more than 27,000 people in the city, hospitals stopped all non-essential services and the city's bustling Chinatown became a ghost town. The disease also devastated the local economy, which prompted the Rolling Stones to put on a charity concert attended by about 500,000 people.  By 2003, Toronto was the epicentre of the Sars outbreak in North America President Donald Trump has signed into law the largest spending bill in US history.

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Every day is a struggle for Italians to take in the scale of this tragedy. Itâs like the country is losing the population of a village day after day. There have been 541 deaths just in the region of Lombardy in the past 24 hours. Itâs staggering. Although it is hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, there are grounds for it: the new infection rate is declining and the curve is flattening. But more than two weeks into the nationwide lockdown, progress is slow and uneven. And the awful news keeps coming: 46 doctors have now died since the outbreak began. What is clear is that the containment measures will have to be extended â possibly for months, says the national health council. That will cause anxiety not just here, where the lockdown is crushing the Italian economy, but around the world, where Italyâs restrictions are a model for many other countries. Italy is a week or two ahead of most of Europe â both in the progression of the virus and in the lockdown. So what happens here will be closely watched elsewhere. Cyclists in the UK have been warned not to continue riding in groups this weekend - or face having the right to get on their bikes taken away from them. Pictures showed people across parts of the UK, including many cyclists, visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers last weekend. ""People on bikes were not the only culprits in last weekend's mass dash to the outdoors but, despite strong guidance from ourselves and others, too many chose to ignore the prime minister's instructions on social distancing, continuing to ride in groups and meet in cafes for a mid-ride chat,"" says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington. ""This isn't just irresponsible, it is putting people's lives at risk. ""A repeat of that this weekend risks further Government measures to take away the privilege of riding a bike for all of us and now more than ever, it is not one we can afford to lose."" Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ukraine is to shut its borders from midnight on Friday Thousands of home-bound Ukrainians have been queuing for hours at Polish border crossings before they are shut to pedestrians due to the coronavirus pandemic. Polandâs state news agency, quoting the Polish Border Guard, said more than 3,000 Ukrainian citizens, who do not have their own transport, were waiting at the crossing in Korczowa, in south-east Poland, on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, 4,000 Ukrainians left Poland, according to the Polish Border Guard. Many work in Poland in the service industry, which has been largely closed down because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But it appears Ukraineâs decision to close its borders from midnight on Friday has contributed to the exodus.  Poland closed its own borders to foreign nationals on 15 March and returning Polish citizens have subsequently had to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. Only three border crossings between Poland and Ukraine remain open US President Donald Trump attacked the General Motors company on Friday for not producing new ventilators, demanding they âstart making ventilators nowâ in a tweet. âThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, âvery quicklyâ Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,â the president tweeted, suggesting he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. It marks a possible reversal in the president's plan. In recent briefings, Trump has said he could use the Act to order private companies to create much needed medical supplies, but has held off on doing so. On Thursday, he suggested New York - the epicentre of the crisis in the US - was exaggerating a need for ventilators. But Trumpâs actions appear to be pleasing many Americans as the presidentâs latest approval numbers are his best yet. According to a Washington Post poll this week, 48% approve of the presidentâs work and 46% disapprove, which are the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term.

Thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of some of Friday's biggest stories.  As always, you can find our best background and analysishere. By rising above 100,000 confirmed cases (see our post from 21:53), the US outbreak has reached a grim new
milestone in the global pandemic. Earlier this week, confirmed American cases jumped
above that of China, where the outbreak  began in December last
year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said
the US had the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, and that appears to have been realised. In recent days, cases have increased exponentially in
the US (as the chart by Johns Hopkins University demonstrates below). In just short of two weeks, the university's tracker shows that cases have
surged from the low thousands (4,600 on 16 March) to a six figure number. Most
of those cases are in the states of Washington, California and New York. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said the rise in cases was ""a tribute to the
amount of testing that we're doing"". You canread our explainer on the accuracy of President Trump's claims about testing. The number of confirmed cases in the US has risen rapidly in recent days US President Donald Trump says Boris Johnson asked for his help to secure ventilators during a phone call between the two leaders. Speaking at the White House as he signed the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package into law, Mr Trump said he spoke with the UK PM on Friday to wish him a speedy recovery after he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""Before he even said hello he said, 'we need ventilators,'"" Trump said of the call. ""I said, 'wow thatâs a big statement.' Hopefully heâs going to be in good shape."" No 10 has yet to respond to Mr Trump's comments. Just a little reminder: Some of the symptoms of the virus are quite
similar to the common cold or flu - but there is a difference. Watch as the
BBC's Laura Foster breaks it down for you, and what to do if you're in the UK
and think you might have the virus. This video can not be played How do I know if I have coronavirus?  As we mentioned earlier (19.25 entry) US President Donald Trump attacked General Motors in a tweet for not producing new ventilators. He has now ordered the car giant to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking the  Korean War-era Defence Production Act. The act allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Donald Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. He had previously said the order was not necessary because companies were voluntarily converting their operations. ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" he said. Over 100,000 Americans have now been confirmed to have Covid-19.

M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistani courts have ordered the release of more than 1,200 prisoners as they seek to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails during the coronavirus outbreak. The Islamabad High Court has ordered officials to screen and release 408 inmates, who are currently awaiting trial for less severe offences. They are all currently housed in Rawalpindiâs Adyala Jail,  which has an authorised occupancy of 2,174 individuals but is currently housing 5,001. Sindh High Court has also ordered the release of 829 on-trial prisoners held in various jails of the province, and set up a committee to make sure no dangerous criminals get released in the process. Neighbouring India earlier announcedit was planning to release 14,000 prisoners. Orla GuerinBBC News, Istanbul Turkey will halt all international flights and impose a travel ban on cities to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, its president has said. This removes a major global hub â Istanbul airport â from international travel. Other measures include restrictions on inter-city travel, which will require permission from a local governor. Picnic spots, forests and archaeological sites will be closed on weekends, and no group gatherings will be allowed on weekdays. The private sector will move â like the public sector â to a system of flexible working with minimum staff. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the stringent new measures in a special address to the nation on Friday. He said they were necessary because the country had ""entered a new period where we need to make more sacrifices"". The death toll from Covid-19 in Turkey has increased by 17  in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 92. The cancellation of international flights will affect Istanbul airport The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 100,000 in the US,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world. Conservative outlet Fox Business has fired primetime television programme host Trish Regan after she claimed earlier this month the coronavirus crisis was a Democratic ploy to impeach President Trump. Regan's show was suspended after she said the ""Coronavirus Impeachment Scam"" was intended to create ""mass hysteria"" and ""demonise and destroy the president"". The network said it wished Regan well in a statement to the Daily Beast on Friday. Regan said she enjoyed her time with Fox and would focus on her family ""during these troubled times"". Rana JawadBBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The factory workers opted to isolate themselves to better guarantee their ability to keep making protective gear Employees at a Tunisian factory are churning out 50,000 face masks a day and other protective medical gear after opting to go into lockdown at work. The 150 staff have isolated themselves at the Consomed factory for a month. There are separate dormitories for 110 women and 40 men - and enough stocks to last a month. Employee Khawla Rebhi said she greatly missed her family, but her colleagues' good cheer provided some compensation. ""My husband and 16-year-old daughter supported and encouraged me to do this,"" Ms Rebhi, who is in charge of the production line, told the BBC. The North African nation, which went into lockdown on Sunday, has 227 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six patients have died in the last week. Read more here. Fashion houses are among the businesses struggling due to the pandemic Two popular events at Paris Fashion Week have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) said its men's and haute couture shows have been called off for safety and health reasons. The shows were scheduled to take place in June and July as part of Paris Fashion Week. In a statement, the FHCM said it was ""actively working with its members on possible alternatives"", without giving further details. The big French fashion houses are among the many businesses suffering due to the pandemic. Some French design houses, including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga of the luxury Kering group, are producing surgical face masks. Allow Twitter content?

Camilla wrote that while we are all being asked to stay at home to stay safe ""for some of you it is even harder because home is not a safe place"". âI can only imagine that being asked to stay there could feel very isolating and frightening for you and your family. It may mean spending more time with the person who is harming you,"" she added. ""If this is your situation, or you are worried about someone else, I want you to know that you are not alone. Even if you cannot leave your home, you can call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline or contact one of the domestic violence charities. Please stay safe and get help."" Allow Twitter content?
