Petrol supply critical in SE England - retailers,"Some filling stations, including this one in Streatham, south London, reported having no fuel on Saturday Petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England with many forecourts still dry, retailers said. But the Petrol Retailers Association said there was a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide due to the ""restraint"" of drivers. The association's survey of 1,000 petrol stations found 68% have both grades of fuel available, while 16% have no fuel at all. The military is due to begin delivering petrol across the UK from Monday. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a hospital in Leeds, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""You need to take all possible precautions but the supplies are getting in, they are getting to the forecourts, but people just need to be going about their business in the normal way."" He said he understood how ""infuriating"" it has been for people, but added the situation was stabilising and the problems had been driven by demand rather than supply issues. A shortage of drivers and high demand plunged the UK into a fuel crisis that caused lengthy queues outside some petrol stations and led to the closure of many forecourts. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""While more fuel is being delivered to forecourts than is being sold overall, the situation remains critical in London and the South East where many filling stations remain dry."" There were fewer dry sites in Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands, he said. Petrol prices at eight-year high amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Visas for foreign lorry drivers extended Mr Madderson, who represents 5,500 independent retailers among the 8,300 petrol stations in the UK, saidthe extension of the HGV visa cut-off to March next yearwas welcome, and military drivers would begin having an impact from the beginning of next week. Almost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on stations. Large queues and closed forecourts have been reported across London on Saturday. BBC Newsnight's policy editor Lewis Goodall tweeted that queues for petrol in one south London area were ""even longer"" on Saturday and were causing ""considerable congestion"".

Earlier, Mr Madderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the military drivers would be a ""large help"" but independent, neighbourhood filling stations in London and south-east England needed to be made a priority for deliveries ""immediately"". He also warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week - but because of ""global factors"" not because of profiteering. Asked if the visas for foreign HGV drivers to work in the UK could be extended again, the prime minister said ""we will keep everything under review"". But Mr Johnson said: ""What we don't want to do is go back to a situation where we basically allowed the road haulage industry to be sustained with a lot of low-wage immigration that mean wages didn't go up and facilities, standards, the quality of the job didn't go up."" He said poor pay and conditions meant that people did not want to drive lorries for a living, but the government wanted to see more investment in facilities for drivers. Large queues and closed forecourts were reported across London on Saturday Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to ""help fuel stocks further improve"" from Monday, the government said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March. In addition to this, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas. ""These shortages are very real,"" Mr Sunaktold the Daily Mail,external. ""We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world. We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can.""

Why is there an HGV driver shortage?,"The government is taking a number of steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers, amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas. It hasintroduced temporary visasfor 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. The shortage of HGV drivers is due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. TheAnnual Population Survey,externalproduced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that there were 16,000 fewer EU nationals working as HGV drivers in the year ending March 2021, than in the previous year. Even before Covid, the overall estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Covid is certainly part of the problem. As travel became increasingly restricted last year, and large parts of the economy shut down, many European drivers went home. And haulage companies say very few have returned. The pandemic also created a large backlog in HGV driver tests, so it has been impossible to get enough new drivers up and running. The industrywarned the prime minister,externalin June that there were 25,000 fewer candidates passing their test in 2020 than in 2019. There are HGV driver shortages across Europe, but in the UK Brexit has made things worse. Many European drivers who went back to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere, are unable to return. When the UK was part of the EU single market, they used to be able to come and go as they pleased. But new immigration rules mean that is no longer the case. There is also new bureaucracy, and the decline in the value of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has made working in the UK less attractive for EU nationals. The strain on the freight transport system comes before Britain imposes checks on goods coming in from the EU. They have now been delayed until next year - some in January, others in July. If they prove too intrusive, that could make it even more difficult to encourage European drivers to work in this country. Many drivers are paid by the mile or kilometre rather than by the hour, so delays cost them money. There have also been tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. The reform of the IR35 rules - on how people working off the payroll pay tax - are designed to prevent workers setting up limited companies and paying less tax and National Insurance while working, in effect, as an employee. Haulage companies say the average age of HGV drivers in the UK is 55, and they want more to be done to attract younger workers. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? Backlash against longer hours for lorry drivers That includes better terms and conditions, better facilities for long distance drivers to use, and a recognition that they are a vital part of the economy. One consequence of shortages, though, has been thatsome wages for driversare already going up. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. As well as allowing more foreign workers into the UK, Ministry of Defence examiners will be brought in to increase the number of HGV driving tests. There will befree intensive 'boot camps',externalto train 5,000 people to become HGV drivers, with another 1,000 to be trained through courses funded by the adult education budget. The government is also writing to nearly one million drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them to return to the industry. There have been warnings about fruit and vegetable deliveries because of driver shortages It has also slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. There is Â£7,000 per person funding for the Large Goods Vehicle Driver apprenticeship scheme. Andthe government is consultingon a temporary weakening of the rules on what is called cabotage. Cabotage refers to whether a foreign HGV driver arriving in the UK is allowed to make collections and deliveries in the country before returning to their own countries. It's proposing to allow unlimited deliveries in a 14-day period. The Road Haulage Associationopposes this,external, because it will mean non-UK haulage companies can take work in the UK, as opposed to foreign HGV drivers working for UK haulage companies.

Patel pledges to crack down on motorway protests,"The home secretary will promise tougher powers to tackle demonstrators blocking motorways, after a string of protests by climate activists. At the Tory party conference this week, Priti Patel will announce plans for longer sentences and new powers for police to seize protesters' equipment. Climate group Insulate Britain has blocked the M1, M4 and M25 in protests over the last three weeks. Their campaign has already led to hundreds of arrests. On Sunday, the government took out a fresh injunction aimed at preventing activists obstructing traffic on motorways and main roads around London. It is the third such court order taken out by the National Highways agency in an attempt to stop demonstrations on major roads in south-east England. New injunction sought over motorway protests Insulate Britain protesters glue hands to M25 Priti Patel calls M25 climate protesters selfish Anyone breaking the injunction faces imprisonment or an unlimited fine. However, previous injunctions have failed to stop the protests. Ms Patel said the government would not ""tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business"". Boris Johnsontold the Mail on Sunday,externalthat although the right to protest was ""sacrosanct"", there is ""no right to inflict chaos and misery on people trying to go about their lives"". ""This government will always stand on the side of the law-abiding majority, and ensure the toughest penalties possible for criminals who deliberately bring major roads to a standstill. ""We will give the police the powers they need to stop their reckless and selfish behaviour."" Insulate Britain's protests have included occupying roundabouts on the M25 Home Office sources said the government would seek to introduce the new powers by amending the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Thewide-ranging legislation, which already includes new police powers over protests, is making its way through Parliament. Ministers want to make obstructing a highway punishable by an unlimited fine, six months imprisonment, or both. It currently carries a maximum fine of Â£1,000. They also want to hand the police new powers to stop and search protesters suspected of carrying so-called ""lock-on"" equipment - such as glue or bike locks - used to secure themselves to protest sites. This would add to existing police powers to stop and search individuals for offensive weapons and items intended for committing theft, burglary or damage to property. Insulate Britain's campaign, which has been going for more than three weeks, has seen more than 300 arrests. The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, has previously vowed to continue campaigning despite arrests and injunctions. In an open latter to Ms Patel last week it said: ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere."" The campaigners want the government to insulate all homes across the UK by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions. The government said it was investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

Queen hails Songs of Praise on 60th anniversary,"Sunday's episode will feature special guests, favourite hymns, musical collaborations and a message from the Queen The Queen has congratulated ""all those involved"" in BBC One's Songs of Praise as the show celebrates 60 years on air. Nearly 3,000 episodes of the world's longest-running religious TV programme have aired since its first transmission, from Cardiff, in 1961. In a message to be broadcast on Sunday's show in Westminster Abbey, the Queen applauded the series for showing Christianity as ""a living faith"". Hosted by Aled Jones, the show will feature ex-presenters and star guests. In a pre-recorded message, the Queen said: ""For 60 years Songs Of Praise has drawn together congregations and BBC viewers throughout the United Kingdom in collective worship. ""During that time, the programme has shown Christianity as a living faith, not only through hymns and worship songs, but also by featuring the many people who have put their faith at the centre of their lives. ""I congratulate Songs Of Praise and all those involved in the programme on its 60th anniversary."" Committed Christian and former star of The Goon Show, Sir Harry Secombe was a regular presenter in the 90s Dame Thora Hird with Pam Rhodes, the programme's longest-serving presenter The show, which continues to reach more than one million viewers each week, was the brainchild of TV producer Donald Baverstock, who - in 1961 - happened to see a test transmission of an outside broadcast of hymn-singing in Welsh from a Welsh chapel. He later described the emotional draw of ""ordinary people, in their best hats, singing with their souls"". Mr Baverstock suggested to Stuart Hood, then director of BBC TV programmes, that something similar might suit the designated ""closed period"", between 18.15-19.25 on a Sunday evening, which was - at the time - given over, by law, to religious programmes. The first programme came from Tabernacle Baptist Church in Cardiff, from which a format developed of visiting cathedrals and parish churches all over Britain, with the focus on congregational hymn-singing. It was an overnight success, reaching as many as 12 million viewers on some Sundays. The original broadcasts went out live on Sundays from churches, many of which were chosen because they were near sports grounds, where the outside broadcast vehicles were in use on the previous Saturday afternoons. By the time broadcasting restrictions were relaxed in 1972, the show had become a stalwart of the Sunday schedule. Sir Cliff Richard performed at the show's 40th anniversary gala concert in London's Royal Albert Hall Gloria Gaynor also performed at the gala concert in 2001 Singer Charlotte Church presented the Christmas story from Jerusalem in 2000. Over the years, there have been 270 presenters on the programme, including Sir Cliff Richard, Charlotte Church and audience favourite singer Sir Harry Secombe - who crossed over to the show with the demise of ITV's hymn-themed show Highway in 1993. Actress Dame Thora Hird went on to host spin-off show Praise Be! for 17 years. Pam Rhodes, the programme's longest-serving presenter, has presented 386 episodes, having first appeared on the show in 1987. Current host, Aled Jones, has been with the show for 21 years, having made his Songs of Praise debut as a child in 1988. The format of the show has changed over the years, reflecting the changing face of Christianity in the UK. Interviews were introduced in 1977, to complement the hymn-singing and viewers heard stories of faith from members of the local community. Songs of Praise hosts the Gospel Choir of the Year competition annually As the years went by, there were increasingly ambitious outside broadcasts too. In December 1982, Songs of Praise visited the Falklands to meet some of the islanders and armed forces stationed there. More recently, in 2015, an episode was filmed at the so-called ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais. To mark the millennium, more than 65,000 singers performed live in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. The show was relaunched in 2014 in a magazine format, and now features a range of churches, locations, congregations, and choirs - including gospel and Pentecostal churches -but remains firmly ""a Christian music show"". ""For 60 years, Songs of Praise has held a very special place on BBC One. Never has this been more important than the past year - when as churches had to close their doors, Songs Of Praise continued to bring together people of faith across the UK every Sunday,"" said Patrick Holland, director factual, arts and classical music. He added: ""It is a great honour to pay tribute to the world's longest-running religious television programme - long may it continue.""

US firm wins auction to take over Morrisons,"A US private equity group is poised to take control of the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) has won an auction for the British supermarket Morrisons with a Â£7bn ($9.5bn) bid. It marks a return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R. The takeover saga has dragged on since June amid fierce competition from two US-based investment groups. CD&R's victory was announced by the stock market's Takeover Panel on Saturday. The private equity group offered 287p per Morrisons ordinary share, against a rival bid from Fortress, for 286p per share. CD&R's auction offer is slightly higher than the 285p-a-share offer that was recommended by Morrisons' board in August. In July, Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business. The board, which will meet on Saturday, is now expected to recommend shareholders accept the new offer at a meeting set for 19 October. If the bid is approved by shareholders, CD&R will take over Morrisons by November. Morrisons backs US firm's improved takeover offer Morrisons warns driver shortage will raise prices Bidding war looms for Morrisons as rivals circle Morrisons to give workers Boxing Day off Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. The founder, William Morrison's son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years. Previously, CD&R said it recognised Morrisons' ""history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing"". The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and its property portfolio. Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and chief operating officer Trevor Strain both previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco. Mr Higginson said the offer represented ""excellent value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons"". He said the private equity firm had ""a strong record of developing and growing the businesses in which they invest, and they share our vision and ambition for Morrisons"". Sir Terry thanked the board for their recommendation and said CD&R looked forward to shareholders' approval of the deal, adding: ""We continue to believe that Morrisons is an excellent business, with a strong management team, a clear strategy, and good prospects."" Morrisons is among a slew of UK companies that have been targeted by overseas investors - and looks set to become the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity, after Asda was bought out in February. With the UK hit hard by the pandemic and the value of the pound still below its pre-Brexit value, UK businesses may appear cheap to non-UK investors, argues the BBC's business editor Simon Jack. He added that while some say these bids highlight the value of - and confidence in - UK plc, others are concerned that private buyouts increase debt levels, reduce transparency and mean that key decisions about the future of UK companies like Morrisons could be taken in New York rather than Bradford. Sir Terry also advised CD&R on its acquisition of discount retailer B&M, which netted the private equity firm an estimated profit of Â£1bn when it sold it on.

Visas for foreign lorry drivers extended,"Temporary visas are to be issued to 300 overseas fuel drivers ""immediately"", the government has announced. Under the bespoke scheme, those foreign drivers will be able to work in the UK from now until the end of March. Additionally, some 4,700 visas intended for foreign food haulage drivers will be extended by two months, lasting from late October to the end of February. But the government said temporary visas were not a long-term solution and urged firms to invest in a UK workforce. Ministers have also extended the length of temporary visas being issued to 5,500 foreign poultry workers, amid fears of a shortage of Christmas turkeys on supermarket shelves. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve, but the visas have been extended by a week, and will now be valid until 31 December. Johnson urged to recall MPs to sort fuel crisis Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Fuel supply 'still a big problem in SE England' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to recall Parliament from party conference recess, saying ""emergency action"" was needed. But Mr Johnson said the UK supply chain remained ""very resilient"". The temporary visa scheme for 5,000 foreign lorry drivers was originally announced a week ago when the ongoing driver shortage first began disrupting fuel deliveries to petrol stations around the UK. On Friday,the Petrol Retailers Association said fuel supply remained a ""big problem""in south-east England - and ""if anything it had got worse"". From Monday, 200 military servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on forecourts, where queues are becoming commonplace and customers frustrated. Some of those 200 will be seen on the roads this weekend. Having completed specialised training over the past three days, many will be accompanying regular tanker drivers on their deliveries. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ""enough fuel in the country, there always has been"" but it had been a challenge to provide the number of drivers required. Trade association Logistics UK estimates that the UK is in need of about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. The foreign drivers eligible for visas will not be limited to the EU, but the expectation is most of the drivers will be from Europe. Lorry drivers have said some of the conditions they face in the job were putting off younger recruits - the average age of a HGV driver in the UK is 55. But the PM has accused the haulage industry - as well as campaign groups representing the food sector - ofbeing too reliant on low-paid migrant workers. In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week announced a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers.

Extinction Rebellion blocks airport entrances,"Environmental activists have blocked three entrances to Farnborough Airport Environmental activists from Extinction Rebellion have blocked entrances to a private airport in Hampshire. Campaign group members are outside three entrances to Farnborough Airport protesting against carbon dioxide levels produced by private flights. Some of the protesters have locked themselves to a stretch limousine, fuel barrels and a steel tripod. An airport spokeswoman said authorities were monitoring the situation and the airport was still fully operational. An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: ""As world leaders gather for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this month, protesters are calling on the world's super-rich elite of celebrities, oligarchs and business leaders to ditch private flights."" Protesters have accused the airport of ""greenwashing"" after it announced a switch to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)which is created using non-recyclable household waste. Greenwashing is a term used for companies allegedly using misleading information to make products or services sound more environmentally friendly. Protesters accused the private airport of ""greenwashing"" Todd Smith, 32, activist and a former airline pilot from Reading, Berkshire, criticised Farnborough Airport's move to offer sustainable aviation fuel as an alternative. He said: ""The term 'sustainable aviation fuel' was coined by the aviation and fossil fuel industry to deceive the public and greenwash the utterly destructive nature of biofuels. ""Biofuels result in land grabs, deforestation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, rising food prices and land-use emissions which can be worse than the fossil fuel they are replacing.""

Thousands protest against Brazil's president,"The protests come a year ahead of the country's elections Thousands of people have taken to the streets in towns and cities across Brazil to protest against the country's president Jair Bolsonaro. The protests were organised by opposition parties and trade unions and fall exactly one year ahead of the country's elections. Mr Bolsonaro is currently falling behind in opinion polls. Many Brazilians are upset at the president's handling of the pandemic - more than 600,000 people have died. Protesters called for the president's removal Demonstrations took place in more than 160 towns and cities on Saturday. Images show protesters carrying signs, calling for Mr Bolsonaro's removal. 'Everything you should not do, Brazil has done' Jair Bolsonaro: Only God will remove me from power ""This president who is there represents everything that is backward in the world - there is hunger, poverty, corruption and we are here to defend democracy,"" protester Valdo Oliveira told AFP news agency. Protests were held in over 160 cities and towns There have been more than 100 requests filed with the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Mr Bolsonaro. However, its leader has refused to follow up on them. Brazil's Supreme court recently approved several investigations into Mr Bolsonaro. Saturday's protests come after anumber of rallies in support of Mr Bolsonaro last month. They were seen as an attempt to demonstrate that he can still draw huge crowds of supporters after recent polls had him trailing his left-wing rival Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva by nine percentage points. The elections are not due to be held until next October but Mr Bolsonaro's approval ratings have dropped to an all-time low. A poll by the Atlas Institute suggested that 61% of Brazilians described his government's performance as bad or very bad, up from 23% when he first took office in January 2019.

The London Marathon returns to the city's streets for the first full-scale staging of the race in more than two years on Sunday. More than 40,000 runners will join some of the world's best on the usual course that starts in Blackheath and finishes 26.2 miles later in the shadow of Buckingham Palace on The Mall. They will be joined by a similar number completing the distance 'virtually' via a tracking app on a course of their choosing.

Last October, a small, elite fieldcompeted over 19 laps of a closed coursearound St James's Park, with the mass element of the event taking place remotely. London's race director Hugh Brasher said this year's event - 40 years on from the inaugural race in 1981 -""could easily be the most memorable ever"".

The race will start with smaller waves of runners released over 90 minutes, and the usual baggage system, which takes warm-up kit from the start to the finish, has been streamlined to reduce the chance of transmission.

"Stop climate smoke and mirrors, rich nations told","Young protesters in Milan argue that ministers aren't doing enough Rich countries' plans to curb carbon are ""smoke and mirrors"" and must be urgently improved, say poorer nations. Ministers meeting here in Milan at the final UN session before theGlasgow COP26climate conference heard that some progress was being made. But officials from developing countries demanded tougher targets for cutting carbon emissions and more cash to combat climate change. One minister condemned ""selfishness or lack of good faith"" in the rich world. US special envoy John Kerry said all major economies ""must stretch"" to do the maximum they can. Money on the agenda at Milan climate talks Youth have right to be angry on climate, UK PM says Australia PM may skip COP26 climate summit Around 50 ministers from a range of countries met here to try to overcome some significant hurdles before world leaders gather in Glasgow in November. But for extremely vulnerable countries to a changing climate the priority is more ambitious carbon reductions from the rich, to preserve the 1.5C temperature target set by the 2015 Paris agreement. Scientists have warned that allowing the world temperatures to rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is highly dangerous. An assessment of the promises made so far to cut carbon suggests that the world is on track for around 2.7C. Ministers from developing countries say this is just not acceptable - they are already experiencing significant impacts on their economies with warming currently just over 1C. US special envoy John Kerry called on all richer countries to step up ""We're already on hellish ground at 1.1C,"" said Simon Steill, Grenada's environment minister who argues that the plans in place just weren't good enough to prevent disaster for his island state. ""We're talking about lives, we're talking about livelihoods, they cannot apply smoke and mirrors to that."" ""Every action that is taken, every decision that is taken, has to be aligned with 1.5C, we have no choice."" Some delegates felt that richer countries aren't sufficiently engaged on the issue of 1.5C, because they are wealthy enough to adapt to the changes. ""They don't care about 1.5C because if there's sea level rise, they have the means to build sea walls, and they are just remaining there in their high walls of comfort,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, from the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""Some countries are willing to do things but they don't have the means, some have the means but are not willing to do things. Now how do we find the right choreography?"" On this question of choreography, ministers were in agreement that the G20 group of countries should be leading the dance. Alok Sharma is the UK minister in charge of COP26 Mr Kerry called on India and China, who are part of the G20, to put new carbon plans on the table before leaders gather in Glasgow. ""All G20 countries, all large economies, all need to try to stretch to do more,"" he told the gathering. ""I'm not singling out one nation over another. But I am encouraging all of us to try to do the maximum we can."" The mood on the street in Milan could not have contrasted more sharply with the formal, political roundtable discussions inside the PreCOP26 conference. On Friday, students and activists marched to the doors of the conference venue - banners waving and arms linked in a human wall to protect Greta Thunberg, who led the procession. There were cheers of: ""We are unstoppable, another world is possible"". And just one day after sharing the stage with world leaders, and after meeting the Italian prime minister, 18-year-old Greta told a cheering crowd: ""We are sick of their blah blah blah and sick of their lies."" Meanwhile, behind the concrete walls of the conference hall on Saturday, ministers were cautiously optimistic that their discussions had laid crucial foundations for the UN climate meeting in November. As he brought the meeting to a close, Alok Sharma, president for the much-anticipated COP26 in Glasgow, assured me that there was now a tangible ""sense of urgency"". ""It's this set of world leaders that are deciding the future,"" he said. ""We're going to respond to what we've heard here from young people."" One of the biggest remaining hurdles to progress remains the question of finance. The richer world promised to pay developing nations $100bn a year from 2020. That figure hasn't yet been met and while ministers here were confident it would be achieved in Glasgow, the failure to land the money is eroding trust. ""Everything we need to do, we know what that is, and now it's just a question of who's going to be paying for it, who is going to be willing to share their technology,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu. ""And that's where the problem is. So there seems to be at times selfishness or lack of good faith."" Despite these reservations, the UK minister tasked with delivering success in Glasgow was in positive mood after the meeting in Milan. ""I think we go forward to Glasgow with a spirit of co-operation,"" said Alok Sharma. ""I do not want to underestimate the amount of work that is required but I think there is a renewed urgency in our discussions."" However there are significant hurdles to clear before leaders arrive in Glasgow and technical questions about carbon markets and transparency are still unresolved. ""We need to change. And we need to change radically, we need to change fast,"" said EU vice-president Frans Timmermans. ""And that's going to be bloody hard."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

Queen speaks of 'deep affection' for Scotland,"This video can not be played The Queen spoke about her affection for Scotland and the challenges of Covid The Queen has spoken of her ""deep and abiding affection"" for Scotland as she officially opened the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. Her Majesty was joined at the ceremony by Prince Charles and Camilla, The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. As at the last opening in 2016, The Queen was greeted by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Afterwards she met people nominated as ""local heroes"" for their work in the community during the Covid pandemic. Look back on coverage of Holyrood's opening At the start of the ceremony, Her Majesty addressed MSPs gathered in the debating chamber. She congratulated the parliament for being able to mark the new session safely in a ""very trying period"", and noted that it had been at the heart of Scotland's response to the pandemic. ""As we all step out from adverse and uncertain times, occasions such as this today provide an opportunity for hope and optimism,"" Her Majesty said. ""Marking this new session does indeed bring a sense of beginning and renewal."" She urged MSPs to work together despite their differences of opinion. Celebrating people who have made an ""extraordinary contribution"" during the pandemic, The Queen noted the ""countless examples of resilience and goodwill"" that have made a difference to others. She told the chamber: ""I have spoken before of my deep and abiding affection for this wonderful country and of the many happy memories Prince Philip and I always held of our time here. ""It is often said that it is the people that make a place and there are few places where this is truer than it is in Scotland, as we have seen in recent times."" The monarch, who has been on her annual break at Balmoral Castle, will return to Scotland next month for COP26, when the ""eyes of the world"" will be on Glasgow. The Scottish Parliament has a key role to ""help create a better, healthier future for us all and engage with the people they represent, especially our young people"", The Queen added. The Queen was greeted at the Scottish Parliament by Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Parliament's presiding officer Alison Johnstone both reflected on the new diverse nature of the new parliament. ""I'm heartened that this parliament is the most diverse that we have ever returned,"" Ms Johnstone said in her opening remarks, noting the first women of colour elected to the chamber. ""I wish it hadn't taken so long,"" she added. Ms Sturgeon said the chamber better reflected Scotland as a nation ""proud to call itself simply home for everyone who chooses to live here"". She said all parties had more to do but there were more women, people of colour and people with disabilities in the Parliament than ever before. Responding to the Queen's speech, the First Minister offered the parliament's ""deep sympathy and shared sorrow at your loss"" and thanked her for being a ""steadfast friend of our parliament since its establishment in 1999"". Ms Sturgeon continued: ""As we battle through the storm of a global pandemic, hope and the hankering for change is perhaps felt more strongly by more people than at any time in our recent history. ""That gives this Parliament a momentous responsibility and a historic opportunity. ""Covid has been the biggest crisis to confront the world since the Second World War - it has caused pain and heartbreak, it has exposed and exacerbated the inequalities within our society. ""But it has also revealed humankind's boundless capacity for inventiveness, solidarity and love. ""And for those of us in public service, it has reminded us that with collective political will, changes that we might previously have thought impossible or just too difficult can indeed be achieved. ""In the months ahead, we must take the same urgency and resolve with which we have confronted this pandemic and apply it to the hard work of recovery and renewal, to the task of building a fairer and greener future for this and the generations who come after us."" Due to ongoing Covid restrictions, only invited guests were able to attend. They watched a recorded programme of music and entertainment which organisers said reflected ""the rich diversity of Scotland's communities"".

Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority',"Covid passes could become mandatory in Wales in venues such as nightclubs from 11 October Cracking down on people with fake Covid passes should not be a priority for police officers over serious crimes, a police and crime commissioner has said. Dyfed-Powys Police commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said there were concerns about the ""practicality"" of policing passes. Covid passescould become mandatory in Wales from 11 October if the Senedd passes proposals on Tuesday. The Welsh government said their introduction could help keep businesses open when virus rates were high. If approved, people in Wales would need an NHS Covid Pass to enter nightclubs and large events. Anyone aged over 18 would be required show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated, or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid: Faking test results to get pass to be illegal in Wales Covid: Schools in Wales see more than 10,000 cases Mr Llywelyn said police would always prioritise incidents that ""cause the most harm and risk to the community"", and would only intervene when there were ""serious breaches"". As part of its plans to introduce the policy, the Welsh government also wants to make itillegal to fake a lateral flow testfor a Covid pass. Mr Llywelyn said in the first instance, event managers and local authorities should step in to deal with rule-breakers to avoid ""additional demand"" on police. He urged the public to follow any new rules, but said he was not expecting a high number of people to break any potential law. Anyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, can get a pass. Covid passes are available digitally via the NHS website, but not via the NHS app in Wales. You have to go through several steps to register for one, including a picture of your ID. Once you have done this, you can produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop. If the law is passed on Tuesday, passes will be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sporting events Some places have already rolled out Covid passes, including for gigs and festivals. Academi Club in Bangor decided to introduce them for Fresher's week to give party-goers peace of mind. Nightclub manager Ash James says most people are in favour of Covid passes Manager Ash James said he was surprised by how positive the response from students was. ""Most people are in favour of it and feel better about coming to a venue that asked for it,"" he said. But he added setting it up was not without challenges. ""We had to have quite a few staff on the doors helping people to download the Covid pass,"" he said, but added students had been generally prepared. Students Beca Evans (left) and Brengain Rhys find passes reassuring Bangor University student Beca Evans, 18, said it was a ""bit of a stress to get it in"" at first, but once you had successfully applied for one it became easy. ""One of my flatmates couldn't go out one night to that particular club because she hadn't heard about it in time,"" she said. ""But once you did it, you just turned up to the club, showed you've got it and they let you in."" Fellow student Brengain Rhys, also 18, said she was worried about catching Covid, but the passes made her feel ""much safer"" and ""put her mind at ease"". But some voices representing clubs said they felt they were being ""targeted"" and estimate they could lose up to 30% of their trade. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said for clubs that are already in debt due to the pandemic, the ""last minute"" proposals were ""extremely tough"" to take on board. This week, NITA lost a legal challenge against the Scottish government's introduction of vaccine passes, but Mr Kill said they had not ruled out taking legal action. ""Nothing is off the table,"" he said. ""We are already seeing fraudulent versions of the Covid passes, lateral flow tests... so we're anticipating a very, very challenging environment if this gets through the Senedd on Tuesday,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""This additional measure, we feel, is potentially just a step too far given the work that has been done by the sector."" In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""The Covid pass is one of a suite of measures that could help to prevent transmission now that we are mixing more freely with each other. ""We need to balance the evidence available against the social and economic needs of the country and the Covid pass is one way to help keep businesses open when rates of the virus are high.""

Analysis: Met facing questions over Everard murder,"There is an air of crisis in British policing this weekend as it faces a great moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers. But that is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. He was sentenced this week to awhole-life term in prison. So what happens now? Well first there is no sign that ministers are going to make Dame Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Met and the UK's top officer, take the blame. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Dame Cressida by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Clearly, society is not filled with homicidal sex offenders. But the fact is they do exist and it's unarguable that they use deception to get themselves into positions of trust. In that context, Couzens' ability to hide undetected within policing is similar to the dreadful story ofthe Soham murders,externalalmost 20 years ago - in which a suspected sex offender was able to work as a school caretaker. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case Couzens, we now know, has been the subject of three allegations of indecent exposure - including reports he drove into McDonald's naked from the waist down. The first allegation of what has long been downplayed as ""flashing"" occurred in 2015 when he was in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, guarding the Dungeness power station on the English Channel. The police watchdog is still investigating what Kent Police knew about Couzens before he was able to transfer to the neighbouring Metropolitan force in London. Scotland Yard says its vetting systems did not fail - but admits the system did not pick up this incident. An investigation continues into how far an officer had got in establishing that Couzens was the suspect. Police must take harassment more seriously - Patel What should you do if you are stopped by police? This question of how officers are vetted is now a very live issue - not just because of ""missed opportunities"" from previous allegations - but also whether the system is set up to screen out candidates who may have a propensity to violence. But the focal point is quickly moving beyond whether vetting systems are technically good enough to root out dodgy candidates - to whether there is a permissive sexist culture that allows them to remain in the police. This video can not be played ""You have little power to say no"" - Women react to the Met's safety advice following the Everard case When I was a trainee reporter in Humberside more than 20 years ago and our newsroom got a tip of some kind of violence in the town, I'd call the police control room. ""Nah, just a domestic,"" the bored duty sergeant would reply. And that response, say critics, is the first part of the problem. For too long police forces have downplayed or ignored the everyday violence and misogyny that men inflict on women. Just last month, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said there was an epidemic of violence against women and girls that deserved the same resources and focus as terrorism. So why is it not a bigger priority? Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire, says there is a significant minority in uniform who are ""actively deviant"" - misogynistic officers who are abusing power - some of whom are in turn involved in domestic and sexual abuse. In 2016, she ordered her force to start recording misogyny as a hate crime - and the Law Commission, which advises ministers on major legal reforms will soon publish its own proposals on the issue. But Ms Fish's point is reinforced by the fact that the police watchdog is not just investigating what was known about Couzens -but also five other officers who were in a Whatsapp groupthat shared allegedly misogynistic and discriminatory messages. Sue Fish says she has seen nothing from either the prime minister or Dame Cressida Dick that shows they understand how pervasive this culture is. Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card The Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC - a former police and crime commissioner and career criminal justice expert - also says sexism is rife in policing. ""There is no doubt whatsoever that, particularly for female victims, faith in the police has collapsed,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. ""We did a survey a year ago which showed that only 5% of rape complainants thought they could get justice by going to the police. This is the worst it has been - but it is not a new thing. ""Probably innate sexism runs through the police more deeply than it runs through society. ""There is no critical mass of female officers to change the culture. The culture remains male-dominated. ""I have heard people say that 'you can be gay, you can be black, you can be a woman. As long as you behave like a straight white male'."" Police boss urged to quit over comments on women Gross misconduct probe into Couzens WhatsApp group The BBC understands recruitment data shows the number of women applying this year to join the police has been rising - and so chiefs know that their response to Sarah Everard's murder will be critical to maintaining that progress. Maggie Blyth, Hampshire's deputy chief constable, is about to become the first senior officer to co-ordinate a national strategy on violence against women and girls. She's told the BBC that there is work to be done to regain the trust that has been lost - but this is also an opportunity that has to be seized. Back in the summer, Dame Cressida Dick wanted to emphasise that Wayne Couzens was a shocking but exceptional case. But as he begins a whole life sentence, the dreadful crime has become British policing's third major crisis of trust in just over three decades. The first was the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which innocent football fans were blamed for their own deaths amid a police cover-up of mistakes. The second was the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, leading to the devastating public inquiry conclusion that the Met Police was institutionally racist. History shows that the response to both of these awful events was, for too long, driven by denial, dither and delay. But ultimately there had to be recognition of the injustice. And that's why the response to Sarah Everard's death will tell us so much about the future direction of British police. Police must take harassment more seriously - Patel Gross misconduct probe into Couzens WhatsApp group Police boss urged to quit over comments on women Sarah Everard's murderer will never be freed Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Petrol supply critical in SE England - retailersBut the Petrol Retailers Association says driver restraint means the problem is improving nationwide.UK,"Some filling stations, including this one in Streatham, south London, reported having no fuel on Saturday Petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England with many forecourts still dry, retailers said. But the Petrol Retailers Association said there was a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide due to the ""restraint"" of drivers. The association's survey of 1,000 petrol stations found 68% have both grades of fuel available, while 16% have no fuel at all. The military is due to begin delivering petrol across the UK from Monday. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a hospital in Leeds, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""You need to take all possible precautions but the supplies are getting in, they are getting to the forecourts, but people just need to be going about their business in the normal way."" He said he understood how ""infuriating"" it has been for people, but added the situation was stabilising and the problems had been driven by demand rather than supply issues. A shortage of drivers and high demand plunged the UK into a fuel crisis that caused lengthy queues outside some petrol stations and led to the closure of many forecourts. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""While more fuel is being delivered to forecourts than is being sold overall, the situation remains critical in London and the South East where many filling stations remain dry."" There were fewer dry sites in Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands, he said. Petrol prices at eight-year high amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Visas for foreign lorry drivers extended Mr Madderson, who represents 5,500 independent retailers among the 8,300 petrol stations in the UK, saidthe extension of the HGV visa cut-off to March next yearwas welcome, and military drivers would begin having an impact from the beginning of next week. Almost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on stations. Large queues and closed forecourts have been reported across London on Saturday. BBC Newsnight's policy editor Lewis Goodall tweeted that queues for petrol in one south London area were ""even longer"" on Saturday and were causing ""considerable congestion"".

Earlier, Mr Madderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the military drivers would be a ""large help"" but independent, neighbourhood filling stations in London and south-east England needed to be made a priority for deliveries ""immediately"". He also warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week - but because of ""global factors"" not because of profiteering. Asked if the visas for foreign HGV drivers to work in the UK could be extended again, the prime minister said ""we will keep everything under review"". But Mr Johnson said: ""What we don't want to do is go back to a situation where we basically allowed the road haulage industry to be sustained with a lot of low-wage immigration that mean wages didn't go up and facilities, standards, the quality of the job didn't go up."" He said poor pay and conditions meant that people did not want to drive lorries for a living, but the government wanted to see more investment in facilities for drivers. Large queues and closed forecourts were reported across London on Saturday Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to ""help fuel stocks further improve"" from Monday, the government said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March. In addition to this, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas. ""These shortages are very real,"" Mr Sunaktold the Daily Mail,external. ""We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world. We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can."" Andthe Financial Times reports,externalthat turkeys will be imported to the UK from France and Poland in the run-up to Christmas after farmers reared about one million fewer birds.

"Queen speaks of 'deep affection' for ScotlandThe new session brings ""a sense of beginning and renewal"", she says in her speech.Scotland","This video can not be played The Queen spoke about her affection for Scotland and the challenges of Covid The Queen has spoken of her ""deep and abiding affection"" for Scotland as she officially opened the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. Her Majesty was joined at the ceremony by Prince Charles and Camilla, The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. As at the last opening in 2016, The Queen was greeted by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Afterwards she met people nominated as ""local heroes"" for their work in the community during the Covid pandemic. Look back on coverage of Holyrood's opening At the start of the ceremony, Her Majesty addressed MSPs gathered in the debating chamber. She congratulated the parliament for being able to mark the new session safely in a ""very trying period"", and noted that it had been at the heart of Scotland's response to the pandemic. ""As we all step out from adverse and uncertain times, occasions such as this today provide an opportunity for hope and optimism,"" Her Majesty said. ""Marking this new session does indeed bring a sense of beginning and renewal."" She urged MSPs to work together despite their differences of opinion.

Earlier, Mr Madderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the military drivers would be a ""large help"" but independent, neighbourhood filling stations in London and south-east England needed to be made a priority for deliveries ""immediately"". He also warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week - but because of ""global factors"" not because of profiteering. Asked if the visas for foreign HGV drivers to work in the UK could be extended again, the prime minister said ""we will keep everything under review"". But Mr Johnson said: ""What we don't want to do is go back to a situation where we basically allowed the road haulage industry to be sustained with a lot of low-wage immigration that mean wages didn't go up and facilities, standards, the quality of the job didn't go up."" He said poor pay and conditions meant that people did not want to drive lorries for a living, but the government wanted to see more investment in facilities for drivers. Large queues and closed forecourts were reported across London on Saturday Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to ""help fuel stocks further improve"" from Monday, the government said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March. In addition to this, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas. ""These shortages are very real,"" Mr Sunaktold the Daily Mail,external. ""We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world.

"Visas for foreign lorry drivers extendedThe government is issuing 300 visas to overseas fuel tanker drivers ""immediately"" to ease delivery issues.Business","Temporary visas are to be issued to 300 overseas fuel drivers ""immediately"", the government has announced. Under the bespoke scheme, those foreign drivers will be able to work in the UK from now until the end of March. Additionally, some 4,700 visas intended for foreign food haulage drivers will be extended by two months, lasting from late October to the end of February. But the government said temporary visas were not a long-term solution and urged firms to invest in a UK workforce. Ministers have also extended the length of temporary visas being issued to 5,500 foreign poultry workers, amid fears of a shortage of Christmas turkeys on supermarket shelves. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve, but the visas have been extended by a week, and will now be valid until 31 December. Johnson urged to recall MPs to sort fuel crisis Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Fuel supply 'still a big problem in SE England' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to recall Parliament from party conference recess, saying ""emergency action"" was needed. But Mr Johnson said the UK supply chain remained ""very resilient"". The temporary visa scheme for 5,000 foreign lorry drivers was originally announced a week ago when the ongoing driver shortage first began disrupting fuel deliveries to petrol stations around the UK. On Friday,the Petrol Retailers Association said fuel supply remained a ""big problem""in south-east England - and ""if anything it had got worse"". From Monday, 200 military servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on forecourts, where queues are becoming commonplace and customers frustrated. Some of those 200 will be seen on the roads this weekend. Having completed specialised training over the past three days, many will be accompanying regular tanker drivers on their deliveries. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ""enough fuel in the country, there always has been"" but it had been a challenge to provide the number of drivers required. Trade association Logistics UK estimates that the UK is in need of about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. The foreign drivers eligible for visas will not be limited to the EU, but the expectation is most of the drivers will be from Europe. Lorry drivers have said some of the conditions they face in the job were putting off younger recruits - the average age of a HGV driver in the UK is 55. But the PM has accused the haulage industry - as well as campaign groups representing the food sector - ofbeing too reliant on low-paid migrant workers. In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week announced a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers.

Police and crime chief referred to watchdog,"Steve Turner was elected as Cleveland's police and crime commissioner in May Cleveland's police and crime commissioner has been referred to the police watchdog over a caution for theft he received in the 1990s. Steve Turner has admitted receiving the police caution while working as a manager at a supermarket. Middlesbrough Labour MP Andy McDonald used parliamentary privilege to claim he had been sacked by a former employer for ""systematic theft"". Mr Turner said he had ""voluntarily"" resigned and was not sacked. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had received two referrals concerning Mr Turner's conduct from the Cleveland Police and Crime Panel, which scrutinises the PCC's work and decisions. The IOPC said ""any indication a criminal offence may have been committed"" by a PCC must be referred and it would then ""determine whether the matter should be criminally investigated"". Two referrals were ""being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us"", a spokesman said.

Met Police face questions over Sarah Everard murder,"There is an air of crisis in British policing this weekend as it faces a great moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers. But that is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. He was sentenced this week to awhole-life term in prison. So what happens now? Well first there is no sign that ministers are going to make Dame Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Met and the UK's top officer, take the blame. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Dame Cressida by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Clearly, society is not filled with homicidal sex offenders. But the fact is they do exist and it's unarguable that they use deception to get themselves into positions of trust. In that context, Couzens' ability to hide undetected within policing is similar to the dreadful story ofthe Soham murders,externalalmost 20 years ago - in which a suspected sex offender was able to work as a school caretaker. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case Couzens, we now know, has been the subject of three allegations of indecent exposure - including reports he drove into McDonald's naked from the waist down. The first allegation of what has long been downplayed as ""flashing"" occurred in 2015 when he was in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, guarding the Dungeness power station on the English Channel. The police watchdog is still investigating what Kent Police knew about Couzens before he was able to transfer to the neighbouring Metropolitan force in London. Scotland Yard says its vetting systems did not fail - but admits the system did not pick up this incident. An investigation continues into how far an officer had got in establishing that Couzens was the suspect. Police must take harassment more seriously - Patel What should you do if you are stopped by police? This question of how officers are vetted is now a very live issue - not just because of ""missed opportunities"" from previous allegations - but also whether the system is set up to screen out candidates who may have a propensity to violence. But the focal point is quickly moving beyond whether vetting systems are technically good enough to root out dodgy candidates - to whether there is a permissive sexist culture that allows them to remain in the police. This video can not be played ""You have little power to say no"" - Women react to the Met's safety advice following the Everard case When I was a trainee reporter in Humberside more than 20 years ago and our newsroom got a tip of some kind of violence in the town, I'd call the police control room. ""Nah, just a domestic,"" the bored duty sergeant would reply. And that response, say critics, is the first part of the problem. For too long police forces have downplayed or ignored the everyday violence and misogyny that men inflict on women. Just last month, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said there was an epidemic of violence against women and girls that deserved the same resources and focus as terrorism. So why is it not a bigger priority? Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire, says there is a significant minority in uniform who are ""actively deviant"" - misogynistic officers who are abusing power - some of whom are in turn involved in domestic and sexual abuse. In 2016, she ordered her force to start recording misogyny as a hate crime - and the Law Commission, which advises ministers on major legal reforms will soon publish its own proposals on the issue. But Ms Fish's point is reinforced by the fact that the police watchdog is not just investigating what was known about Couzens -but also five other officers who were in a Whatsapp groupthat shared allegedly misogynistic and discriminatory messages. Sue Fish says she has seen nothing from either the prime minister or Dame Cressida Dick that shows they understand how pervasive this culture is. Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card The Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC - a former police and crime commissioner and career criminal justice expert - also says sexism is rife in policing. ""There is no doubt whatsoever that, particularly for female victims, faith in the police has collapsed,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. ""We did a survey a year ago which showed that only 5% of rape complainants thought they could get justice by going to the police. This is the worst it has been - but it is not a new thing. ""Probably innate sexism runs through the police more deeply than it runs through society. ""There is no critical mass of female officers to change the culture. The culture remains male-dominated. ""I have heard people say that 'you can be gay, you can be black, you can be a woman. As long as you behave like a straight white male'."" Police boss urged to quit over comments on women Gross misconduct probe into Couzens WhatsApp group The BBC understands recruitment data shows the number of women applying this year to join the police has been rising - and so chiefs know that their response to Sarah Everard's murder will be critical to maintaining that progress. Maggie Blyth, Hampshire's deputy chief constable, is about to become the first senior officer to co-ordinate a national strategy on violence against women and girls. She's told the BBC that there is work to be done to regain the trust that has been lost - but this is also an opportunity that has to be seized. Back in the summer, Dame Cressida Dick wanted to emphasise that Wayne Couzens was a shocking but exceptional case. But as he begins a whole life sentence, the dreadful crime has become British policing's third major crisis of trust in just over three decades. The first was the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which innocent football fans were blamed for their own deaths amid a police cover-up of mistakes. The second was the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, leading to the devastating public inquiry conclusion that the Met Police was institutionally racist. History shows that the response to both of these awful events was, for too long, driven by denial, dither and delay. But ultimately there had to be recognition of the injustice. And that's why the response to Sarah Everard's death will tell us so much about the future direction of British police. Police must take harassment more seriously - Patel Gross misconduct probe into Couzens WhatsApp group Police boss urged to quit over comments on women Sarah Everard's murderer will never be freed Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

As at the last opening in 2016, The Queen was greeted by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Afterwards she met people nominated as ""local heroes"" for their work in the community during the Covid pandemic. Look back on coverage of Holyrood's opening At the start of the ceremony, Her Majesty addressed MSPs gathered in the debating chamber. She congratulated the parliament for being able to mark the new session safely in a ""very trying period"", and noted that it had been at the heart of Scotland's response to the pandemic. ""As we all step out from adverse and uncertain times, occasions such as this today provide an opportunity for hope and optimism,"" Her Majesty said. ""Marking this new session does indeed bring a sense of beginning and renewal."" She urged MSPs to work together despite their differences of opinion. Celebrating people who have made an ""extraordinary contribution"" during the pandemic, The Queen noted the ""countless examples of resilience and goodwill"" that have made a difference to others. She told the chamber: ""I have spoken before of my deep and abiding affection for this wonderful country and of the many happy memories Prince Philip and I always held of our time here. ""It is often said that it is the people that make a place and there are few places where this is truer than it is in Scotland, as we have seen in recent times."" The monarch, who has been on her annual break at Balmoral Castle, will return to Scotland next month for COP26, when the ""eyes of the world"" will be on Glasgow. The Scottish Parliament has a key role to ""help create a better, healthier future for us all and engage with the people they represent, especially our young people"", The Queen added. The Queen was greeted at the Scottish Parliament by Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Parliament's presiding officer Alison Johnstone both reflected on the new diverse nature of the new parliament. ""I'm heartened that this parliament is the most diverse that we have ever returned,"" Ms Johnstone said in her opening remarks, noting the first women of colour elected to the chamber. ""I wish it hadn't taken so long,"" she added. Ms Sturgeon said the chamber better reflected Scotland as a nation ""proud to call itself simply home for everyone who chooses to live here"". She said all parties had more to do but there were more women, people of colour and people with disabilities in the Parliament than ever before. Responding to the Queen's speech, the First Minister offered the parliament's ""deep sympathy and shared sorrow at your loss"" and thanked her for being a ""steadfast friend of our parliament since its establishment in 1999"". Ms Sturgeon continued: ""As we battle through the storm of a global pandemic, hope and the hankering for change is perhaps felt more strongly by more people than at any time in our recent history. ""That gives this Parliament a momentous responsibility and a historic opportunity. ""Covid has been the biggest crisis to confront the world since the Second World War - it has caused pain and heartbreak, it has exposed and exacerbated the inequalities within our society. ""But it has also revealed humankind's boundless capacity for inventiveness, solidarity and love. ""And for those of us in public service, it has reminded us that with collective political will, changes that we might previously have thought impossible or just too difficult can indeed be achieved. ""In the months ahead, we must take the same urgency and resolve with which we have confronted this pandemic and apply it to the hard work of recovery and renewal, to the task of building a fairer and greener future for this and the generations who come after us."" Due to ongoing Covid restrictions, only invited guests were able to attend. They watched a recorded programme of music and entertainment which organisers said reflected ""the rich diversity of Scotland's communities"". The newly-appointed Makar, or national poet, Kathleen Jamierecited a poem specially written for the event. The Royal Conservatoire Brass performed Fanfare for the Opening of Parliament 2021 from Glasgow Cathedral. Michael Biggins, BBC Radio Scotland's Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2021, also performed Ae Fond Kiss by Robert Burns from the BBC Pacific Quay building in Glasgow. Scottish Parliament clerk Rea Cris carried the mace ahead of The Queen as she entered the debating chamber. Ms Cris said: ""It is an honour for me to take on this role within the parliament. ""The mace is part of the parliament's history and tradition, but the principles engraved on the mace continue to inspire our work today. Compassion is one that inspires me the most.""

Scandal-hit Ozy Media to shut down,"Ozy chief executive Carlos Watson was a former CNN news anchor US media firm Ozy Media has announced that it is to close down amid a growing row over its business practices. ""It is.. with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy's doors"", the company said in a statement. It follows reports that Ozy's chief operating officer deceived potential investors during a conference call and is now being investigated by the FBI. Some major advertisers subsequently cut ties with the firm. Ozy's chairman Marc Lasry and ex-BBC journalist Katty Kay have also quit. In another twist, Sharon Osborne, the wife of rock star Ozzy Osbourne, alleged the firm's chief executive, Carlos Watson, falsely claimed the couple had invested in the business. Mr Watsonmade the claims in a TV interview with broadcaster CNBC,externalin 2019 after settling a trademark dispute with the couple. Former BBC journalist Katty Kay quits US media firm Ms Osbourne told CNBC on Thursday: ""This guy is the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life."" Neither Mr Watson nor Ozy Media has commented publicly on the claims. These accusations are outrageous, almost unbelievable - part of a toxic culture of corporate behaviour that exists in parts of Silicon Valley. It is common here to say your company is bigger, more innovative, more successful, more connected, than it really is.  It's seen as ""hustle"", or ""hype"". However, ""fake it till you make it"" - as it's sometimes referred to - has led to some of the biggest scandals in Silicon Valley history. Theranos' CEO and founder is currently on trial in San Jose - accused of a spectacular fraud involving blood testing. Selling a dream that will one day be realised is what most companies do. It's why we have computers and smartphones. But there are countless examples of companies going too far. Some of the things Ozy Media has been accused of are actually pretty common in Silicon Valley, Overstating how popular your content is a classic of the genre - something numerous companies have been accused of. But there are other accusations here that are simply astonishing - that if true may well lead to legal action. It's the kind of story that will deeply worry investors, who are in a constant battle to separate the frauds from the visionaries. Ozy Media, which was launched in California in 2013, produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events, and has won an Emmy for its work. Last weekend, the New York Times reported that its co-founder and chief operating officer, Samir Rao, impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company. Mr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube. Katty Kay called the allegations against the firm ""troubling"" According to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson has since apologised and said Mr Rao was suffering a ""mental health crisis"" at the time. Yet amid growing scrutiny, Ozy this week said it had begun an internal investigation and Mr Rao had taken a leave of absence. On Thursday, Mr Lasry, who owns the NBA basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks, stepped down after only three weeks as chairman. In a statement he said: ""I believe that going forward Ozy requires experience in areas like crisis management and investigations, where I do not have particular expertise."" He added that he remains an investor in Ozy Media. The same day, major advertisers were reported to be pulling their ad campaigns with Ozy. Target, Goldman Sachs and AirBnB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Ford said ""We are pausing our advertising while Ozy Media addresses their current business challenges"" and US banking services firm Ally Financial said its relationship with Ozy was on hold ""in light of recent developments"". On Wednesday, Ms Kay announced she had ""no choice"" but to cut ties, calling the New York Times' allegations ""deeply troubling"". The veteran broadcaster joined Ozy in June after more than three decades at the BBC. On Friday, the Times publishedfresh claims about Ozy,externalmade by a former producer, Brad Bessey. Mr Bessey, who was hired this summer to produce a talk show hosted by Carlos Watson, was reportedly told from the start it would appear in a prime time slot on the US cable network A&E. Yet, he later found out A&E had rejected the show before it began taping, the Times said. Mr Bessey reportedly quit the firm, accusing Mr Watson and Mr Rao of playing ""a dangerous game with the truth"". In the end ""The Carlos Watson Show"" show appeared on Ozy's own website and YouTube. The BBC has contacted Ozy Media for comment.

Private coach industry 'decimated by Covid-19',"Many bus companies cannot run services due to a lack of tourists An industry body representing Northern Ireland's private bus and coach sector has said it is at its most vulnerable. Bus and Coach NI said operators are at risk of collapse. Companies have not been able to run services due to a lack of tourists. Some businesses have received grants from Stormont. Karen Magill, chief executive of Bus and Coach NI, toldBBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business programmethe future for some operators is uncertain. ""Our industry has been decimated by Covid-19 and at this point in time while other sectors of the economy are recovering, unfortunately we are not. ""We still have 75% of our fleet idle and we wont see any return to business until March or April next year,"" she said. ""Despite not being back to full capacity, with little or no income, and restricted demand, we have increased additional costs incurring every day. ""We have significant Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) loans and those increasing Covid debts and restricted demand mean companies are seriously vulnerable. ""If you have a loan of Â£1.5m, your monthly repayment now is Â£16,000, and this is based on actual figures from some companies,"" she said. Asked if she expects all operators to survive the next few months, Ms Magill said: ""At this point in time, no I don't."" Bus and coach support scheme 'has not been smooth' Coach operators' warning over industry's future Coach operators rely heavily on international visitors who book excursions to well-known tourist areas. The pandemic has seen a drastic reduction in the amount of visitors arriving on our shores. For Sean Logan, who owns Logan Executive Travel in Dunloy, County Antrim that means his fleet is parked up. ""We would normally have 50 touring vehicles and at this time of year we would expect our yard to be empty. At the minute we are lucky to get two vehicles on tour a week. ""There is some school work but it's not what we need, with the value of the fleet we have and the debt we have incurred to survive so far. ""My house overlooks my yard and the first thing I see when I pull the curtains back in the morning is a coach park. That's basically what we are. ""They cost me money while they are sitting parked, earning nothing,"" he told Inside Business. More than 90 companies have been provided with grants totalling Â£5.7m The government's furlough scheme ended on 30 September. Mr Logan had to lay off some office staff as there was not enough work. ""The staff we have taken back off furlough are on reduced time, working two or three-day weeks. ""I cannot guarantee categorically that we will survive [the winter]. We have survived this far and we will do everything we can. It has taken over 40 years of my life and we will do the best we can. It's an impossible situation,"" he said. Ms Magill said additional financial support would help the industry. ""We have had two previous schemes through the Department for Infrastructureâ¦ at this stage 50% of businesses out there were not eligible for support. There was a formula which should have made life simple but didn't. ""We had one operator who received Â£3,200. Out of that, which is what they were eligible for, they had to pay Â£1,500 out to their accountant as we had to have all figures backed by an accountancy firm. ""Other operators have benefited from the scheme,"" she said. The Department for Infrastructure said more than 90 companies have been provided with grants totalling Â£5.7m through two schemes. ""Minister Mallon is committed to doing all she can where she has the powers within her department and working with executive colleagues to support the industry through recovery.""

Celebrating people who have made an ""extraordinary contribution"" during the pandemic, The Queen noted the ""countless examples of resilience and goodwill"" that have made a difference to others. She told the chamber: ""I have spoken before of my deep and abiding affection for this wonderful country and of the many happy memories Prince Philip and I always held of our time here. ""It is often said that it is the people that make a place and there are few places where this is truer than it is in Scotland, as we have seen in recent times."" The monarch, who has been on her annual break at Balmoral Castle, will return to Scotland next month for COP26, when the ""eyes of the world"" will be on Glasgow. The Scottish Parliament has a key role to ""help create a better, healthier future for us all and engage with the people they represent, especially our young people"", The Queen added. The Queen was greeted at the Scottish Parliament by Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Parliament's presiding officer Alison Johnstone both reflected on the new diverse nature of the new parliament. ""I'm heartened that this parliament is the most diverse that we have ever returned,"" Ms Johnstone said in her opening remarks, noting the first women of colour elected to the chamber. ""I wish it hadn't taken so long,"" she added. Ms Sturgeon said the chamber better reflected Scotland as a nation ""proud to call itself simply home for everyone who chooses to live here"". She said all parties had more to do but there were more women, people of colour and people with disabilities in the Parliament than ever before. Responding to the Queen's speech, the First Minister offered the parliament's ""deep sympathy and shared sorrow at your loss"" and thanked her for being a ""steadfast friend of our parliament since its establishment in 1999"". Ms Sturgeon continued: ""As we battle through the storm of a global pandemic, hope and the hankering for change is perhaps felt more strongly by more people than at any time in our recent history. ""That gives this Parliament a momentous responsibility and a historic opportunity. ""Covid has been the biggest crisis to confront the world since the Second World War - it has caused pain and heartbreak, it has exposed and exacerbated the inequalities within our society. ""But it has also revealed humankind's boundless capacity for inventiveness, solidarity and love. ""And for those of us in public service, it has reminded us that with collective political will, changes that we might previously have thought impossible or just too difficult can indeed be achieved. ""In the months ahead, we must take the same urgency and resolve with which we have confronted this pandemic and apply it to the hard work of recovery and renewal, to the task of building a fairer and greener future for this and the generations who come after us."" Due to ongoing Covid restrictions, only invited guests were able to attend.

"Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority'A police and crime commissioner says there are concerns about the ""practicality"" of policing passes.Wales","Covid passes could become mandatory in Wales in venues such as nightclubs from 11 October Cracking down on people with fake Covid passes should not be a priority for police officers over serious crimes, a police and crime commissioner has said. Dyfed-Powys Police commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said there were concerns about the ""practicality"" of policing passes. Covid passescould become mandatory in Wales from 11 October if the Senedd passes proposals on Tuesday. The Welsh government said their introduction could help keep businesses open when virus rates were high. If approved, people in Wales would need an NHS Covid Pass to enter nightclubs and large events. Anyone aged over 18 would be required show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated, or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid: Faking test results to get pass to be illegal in Wales Covid: Schools in Wales see more than 10,000 cases Mr Llywelyn said police would always prioritise incidents that ""cause the most harm and risk to the community"", and would only intervene when there were ""serious breaches"". As part of its plans to introduce the policy, the Welsh government also wants to make itillegal to fake a lateral flow testfor a Covid pass. Mr Llywelyn said in the first instance, event managers and local authorities should step in to deal with rule-breakers to avoid ""additional demand"" on police. He urged the public to follow any new rules, but said he was not expecting a high number of people to break any potential law. Anyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, can get a pass. Covid passes are available digitally via the NHS website, but not via the NHS app in Wales. You have to go through several steps to register for one, including a picture of your ID. Once you have done this, you can produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop. If the law is passed on Tuesday, passes will be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sporting events Some places have already rolled out Covid passes, including for gigs and festivals. Academi Club in Bangor decided to introduce them for Fresher's week to give party-goers peace of mind. Nightclub manager Ash James says most people are in favour of Covid passes Manager Ash James said he was surprised by how positive the response from students was. ""Most people are in favour of it and feel better about coming to a venue that asked for it,"" he said. But he added setting it up was not without challenges. ""We had to have quite a few staff on the doors helping people to download the Covid pass,"" he said, but added students had been generally prepared. Students Beca Evans (left) and Brengain Rhys find passes reassuring Bangor University student Beca Evans, 18, said it was a ""bit of a stress to get it in"" at first, but once you had successfully applied for one it became easy. ""One of my flatmates couldn't go out one night to that particular club because she hadn't heard about it in time,"" she said. ""But once you did it, you just turned up to the club, showed you've got it and they let you in."" Fellow student Brengain Rhys, also 18, said she was worried about catching Covid, but the passes made her feel ""much safer"" and ""put her mind at ease"". But some voices representing clubs said they felt they were being ""targeted"" and estimate they could lose up to 30% of their trade. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said for clubs that are already in debt due to the pandemic, the ""last minute"" proposals were ""extremely tough"" to take on board. This week, NITA lost a legal challenge against the Scottish government's introduction of vaccine passes, but Mr Kill said they had not ruled out taking legal action. ""Nothing is off the table,"" he said. ""We are already seeing fraudulent versions of the Covid passes, lateral flow tests... so we're anticipating a very, very challenging environment if this gets through the Senedd on Tuesday,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""This additional measure, we feel, is potentially just a step too far given the work that has been done by the sector."" In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""The Covid pass is one of a suite of measures that could help to prevent transmission now that we are mixing more freely with each other. ""We need to balance the evidence available against the social and economic needs of the country and the Covid pass is one way to help keep businesses open when rates of the virus are high.""

Scandal-hit Ozy Media to shut downIt follows allegations that an executive deceived potential investors during a conference call.Business,"Ozy chief executive Carlos Watson was a former CNN news anchor US media firm Ozy Media has announced that it is to close down amid a growing row over its business practices. ""It is.. with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy's doors"", the company said in a statement. It follows reports that Ozy's chief operating officer deceived potential investors during a conference call and is now being investigated by the FBI. Some major advertisers subsequently cut ties with the firm. Ozy's chairman Marc Lasry and ex-BBC journalist Katty Kay have also quit. In another twist, Sharon Osborne, the wife of rock star Ozzy Osbourne, alleged the firm's chief executive, Carlos Watson, falsely claimed the couple had invested in the business. Mr Watsonmade the claims in a TV interview with broadcaster CNBC,externalin 2019 after settling a trademark dispute with the couple. Former BBC journalist Katty Kay quits US media firm Ms Osbourne told CNBC on Thursday: ""This guy is the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life."" Neither Mr Watson nor Ozy Media has commented publicly on the claims. These accusations are outrageous, almost unbelievable - part of a toxic culture of corporate behaviour that exists in parts of Silicon Valley. It is common here to say your company is bigger, more innovative, more successful, more connected, than it really is.  It's seen as ""hustle"", or ""hype"". However, ""fake it till you make it"" - as it's sometimes referred to - has led to some of the biggest scandals in Silicon Valley history. Theranos' CEO and founder is currently on trial in San Jose - accused of a spectacular fraud involving blood testing. Selling a dream that will one day be realised is what most companies do. It's why we have computers and smartphones. But there are countless examples of companies going too far. Some of the things Ozy Media has been accused of are actually pretty common in Silicon Valley, Overstating how popular your content is a classic of the genre - something numerous companies have been accused of. But there are other accusations here that are simply astonishing - that if true may well lead to legal action. It's the kind of story that will deeply worry investors, who are in a constant battle to separate the frauds from the visionaries. Ozy Media, which was launched in California in 2013, produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events, and has won an Emmy for its work. Last weekend, the New York Times reported that its co-founder and chief operating officer, Samir Rao, impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company. Mr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube. Katty Kay called the allegations against the firm ""troubling"" According to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson has since apologised and said Mr Rao was suffering a ""mental health crisis"" at the time. Yet amid growing scrutiny, Ozy this week said it had begun an internal investigation and Mr Rao had taken a leave of absence. On Thursday, Mr Lasry, who owns the NBA basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks, stepped down after only three weeks as chairman. In a statement he said: ""I believe that going forward Ozy requires experience in areas like crisis management and investigations, where I do not have particular expertise."" He added that he remains an investor in Ozy Media. The same day, major advertisers were reported to be pulling their ad campaigns with Ozy. Target, Goldman Sachs and AirBnB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Ford said ""We are pausing our advertising while Ozy Media addresses their current business challenges"" and US banking services firm Ally Financial said its relationship with Ozy was on hold ""in light of recent developments"". On Wednesday, Ms Kay announced she had ""no choice"" but to cut ties, calling the New York Times' allegations ""deeply troubling"". The veteran broadcaster joined Ozy in June after more than three decades at the BBC. On Friday, the Times publishedfresh claims about Ozy,externalmade by a former producer, Brad Bessey. Mr Bessey, who was hired this summer to produce a talk show hosted by Carlos Watson, was reportedly told from the start it would appear in a prime time slot on the US cable network A&E. Yet, he later found out A&E had rejected the show before it began taping, the Times said. Mr Bessey reportedly quit the firm, accusing Mr Watson and Mr Rao of playing ""a dangerous game with the truth"". In the end ""The Carlos Watson Show"" show appeared on Ozy's own website and YouTube. The BBC has contacted Ozy Media for comment.

Biden insists infrastructure bill will get done,"Mr Biden flashed a thumbs up as he arrived for budget talks President Biden has insisted his $1tn (Â£750bn) infrastructure bill will eventually be passed by Congress amid an impasse in his own party. ""It doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days, or six weeks, we're going to get it done,"" he said after a surprise visit to Congress on Friday. Some Democrats refuse to back the plan until a separate $3.5tn welfare and climate change bill is voted in. But centrists in the party want to spend less on those issues. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted on Friday evening that ""more time is needed"" to find a compromise. Thursday's vote on the infrastructure bill was postponed and it was unclear when another attempt to hold a vote would be made. Mr Biden's visit to Capitol Hill on Friday saw him meet privately with House Democrats in a bid to break the deadlock. Media reports said he had sought to encourage compromise between the factions. Reuters quoted a source as saying Mr Biden had suggested scaling back the welfare and climate bill to about $2 trillion, saying ""even a smaller bill can make historic investments"". The bipartisan $1tn public works bill, which would apply to routine transportation, broadband, water systems and other projects, enjoys wide support - but liberal (or progressive) Democrats are linking its passage to their more ambitious welfare and climate change bill. That bill would raise taxes on corporations and the rich, investing the revenue in a broad array of social programmes, including early childhood education, universal preschool, government-funded two-year college education, paid family and medical leave, an expansion of government health insurance and environmental spending. The biggest test of Biden's presidency so far Earlier this week, the White House cancelled Mr Biden's trip to Chicago so he could focus on whipping the needed votes. Reflecting the centrist position, Senator Joe Manchin said he was ready to meet the president less than halfway, at $1.5tn on infrastructure. He described the proposed figure of $3.5tn as ""fiscal insanity"". Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal, tweeted on Friday that ""the fate of the planet"" rested on the $3.5tn bill. ""Without a strong reconciliation bill there will be no serious effort to cut carbon emissions and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,"" he said. He added: ""There can be no infrastructure bill without a strong reconciliation bill."" Mr Biden's party has the thinnest of majorities in both the House and Senate, and is eager to push through its signature policies before next year's congressional elections, when the Republicans will attempt to regain control. On Thursday Congress did pass a temporary measure to keep the federal government funded until early December. Federal museums, national parks and safety programmes would have had to close without the funding, which also includes hurricane relief and help for Afghan refugees.

The Queen to officially open Scottish Parliament,"This video can not be played The Queen spoke about her affection for Scotland and the challenges of Covid The Queen has spoken of her ""deep and abiding affection"" for Scotland as she officially opened the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. Her Majesty was joined at the ceremony by Prince Charles and Camilla, The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. As at the last opening in 2016, The Queen was greeted by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Afterwards she met people nominated as ""local heroes"" for their work in the community during the Covid pandemic. Look back on coverage of Holyrood's opening At the start of the ceremony, Her Majesty addressed MSPs gathered in the debating chamber. She congratulated the parliament for being able to mark the new session safely in a ""very trying period"", and noted that it had been at the heart of Scotland's response to the pandemic. ""As we all step out from adverse and uncertain times, occasions such as this today provide an opportunity for hope and optimism,"" Her Majesty said.
