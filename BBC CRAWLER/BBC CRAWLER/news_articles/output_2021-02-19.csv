Four can meet for exercise in Wales from Saturday,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal Family,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

America is back - US Secretary of State Blinken,"This video can not be played US Secretary of State Antony Blinken: ""We're determined to engage with the world"" ""America is back"" and is fully engaged in helping resolve issues including the pandemic, climate change and Iran's nuclear ambitions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told the BBC. In his first international interview, Mr Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19. He also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. It marks a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. Mr Blinken was speaking as the leaders of the G7 richest industrialised nations met in virtual session. Who is America's new top diplomat? How will Biden change US foreign policy? The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries By Yalda Hakim, BBC News The last four years with Donald Trump in charge, it has been all about America first. But what does the US now stand for in the world with Joe Biden as President? In his first international broadcast interview, I've been speaking to Secretary Blinken about what role Washington can play in resolving conflicts and navigating a path out of the coronavirus pandemic. Blinken has been Biden's top foreign policy advisor for nearly two decades. He has also served as deputy secretary of state. Arguably, not since James Baker under the first President Bush has a Secretary of State entered office with so close a relationship with the president. This is what distinguishes Antony Blinken from Colin Powell, Rex Tillerson or Hillary Clinton. None of these people knew the President deeply. None of them had worked for the president previously. When Antony Blinken speaks, he speaks for the president. He is a consummate foreign policy insider and like his boss he is also someone with a reputation for his civility and graciousness. Blinken has had a front row seat to history over the past 30 years and now he's been tasked by the president to re-frame America's relationship with the world. At the centre of the Trump Administration's approach was great power competition. For Obama it was restraint. For Bush it was the war on terror. I asked Blinken what the Biden Administration's foreign policy bumper sticker was. He smiled and without hesitation said ""American engagement, American leadership"". The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And if it's mutating, it's also going to come back and bite people everywhere."" The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. Mr Blinken also accused China of failing to share information that might shed light on the origins of coronavirus. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. The secretary of state said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. Yes. Under Donald Trump, the US left the deal under which world powers eased crippling economic sanctions, in return for limits on sensitive activities to show it was not developing nuclear weapons. Now the US is examining whether to rejoin the deal. President Biden said on Friday that the US must work with other major powers to rein in what he called Iran's ""destabilising"" nuclear ambitions. For its part, Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US to revive the deal, the US ""must act"" first and lift sanctions. Mr Blinken told the BBC the US and its European partners were ""once again on the same page"" on Iran. ""President Biden has been clear for some time: if Iran returns to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, the United States will do the same thing,"" he said. And he said the US would then work with other countries to confront Iran on other issues, including its influence in the region and its ballistic missile programme. Asked by the BBC's Yalda Hakim how he would respond to accusations that the US had made concessions to Iran, he said the previous approach had failed. ""We have a policy in recent years of so-called 'maximum pressure' on Iran that has not produced results. In fact, the problem has gotten worse. Iran is now much closer to being able to produce, on short order, enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon."" Mr Blinken was also asked aboutthe case of Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, who has accused her family of holding her hostage since she tried to flee in 2018. In the secretly recorded videos, obtained by the BBC, the princess said she feared for her life. The story has prompted global calls for a UN investigation and the UN human rights agency has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide proof that the princess is still alive. The US secretary of state said that the US would be closely monitoring the situation, adding: ""Across the board, with adversaries, competitors, with partners and allies alike.. we take human rights seriously and the president has put it at the heart of our foreign policy and countries can expect us to follow through on that."" On Friday, Dubai's royal family said via the UAE's London embassy that Princess Latifa was ""being cared for at home"". But there was no video or photo released with the family's statement which could serve as proof of life, nor did it give any details about her condition. The Americans are currently reviewing theirpolicy on Afghanistanto decide whether or not to keep troops there. Mr Blinken said the US and others would be putting pressure on the Taliban and others to honour their commitments to disassociate themselves from al-Qaeda. He described the recentmilitary coup in Myanmaras ""a tragic setback to what had been a historic democratic transition"". He condemnedChina's decision to block BBCWorld News television and World Service radio, calling the Chinese information space ""one of the least open"" in the world. ""China uses that to spread misinformation and propaganda... I think ultimately is unsustainable and it requires countries coming together to stand up for free and open information space and we are looking at ways to do that more effectively,"" he said. Mr Blinken refused to be drawn on calls for aboycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, due to be held in Beijing, over allegations of genocide against the Uighur minority, saying only: ""That's something we'll come to at the right time, in the right moment.""

G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine scheme,"Leaders of the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy and Japan held a virtual summit G7 leaders have pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19 and increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. In a joint statement released after a virtual summit on Friday,G7 leaders raised their overall commitment to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn),external. Wealthy countries are facing growing pressure to make sure lower-income nations get fair access to vaccines. President Joe Biden has pledged $4bn in US aid to the fund. An initial $2bn will be donated in 2021, with an additional $2bn coming over the next two years.

The Covax scheme  isaiming to get at least 1.3bn vaccine doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months,external. Covax is co-led by Gavi, known as the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday he was grateful for  the new commitments but  emphasised that more was needed to address the world's vaccination imbalance. ""Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing to do,"" he said at the annual Munich Security Conference, also held virtually on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron is among world leaders calling for further actionto address the world's vaccine imbalance - saying Europe and the US should urgently send up to 5% of their supplies to developing nations. This video can not be played The chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, on the need for a worldwide effort on vaccinations The new commitments come days after UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Friday's online meeting was the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this year's G7 chair, has said thatthe UK will donate much of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer nations. To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according tofigures from Johns Hopkins University,external. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.

UK sees further drop in coronavirus numbers,"Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK,Office for National Statistics,externaldata shows. The figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks. Experts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus. And another 533 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. It brings the UK total to 119,920. Daily figures show there were a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Friday. More than 16.8 million people have had their first COVID vaccine dose, while 589,591 have had a second jab, bringing the total number of shots since the rollout began to nearly 17.5m. Thelatest R number,external, estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people. Other studies of infection rateshave shown a similar ""strong"" decline. The ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest: One in 115 people in England has the virus (compared to one in 80 the week before) In Northern Ireland, it is one in 105 (compared to one in 75 previously) In Wales, it is one in 125 (compared to one in 85 before) In Scotland, it is one in 180 (compared to one in 150) In England, there is some regional variation in the infection rate, although it is decreasing in all areas. North-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus - at around one in 85 people. For London the estimate was one in 100, and for the West Midlands it was one in 110. Elsewhere, the estimates are: one in 120 people for the East Midlands and for Yorkshire and the Humber one in 125 people for eastern England one in 135 for north-east England, south-east England and south-west England It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. Downing Streethas refused to commenton the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation. The Welsh government has alreadyannounced some changes. From Saturday, four people from two different households will be allowed to exercise outdoors together. And from Monday, children in Wales aged between three and seven are returning to school - as are young children inScotland. Experts say any unlocking should be done slowly and cautiously to avoid a rebound surge in cases. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people can catch. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling prompted the first lockdown last March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was hopeful more restrictions could be lifted by the end of May. ""We will still have rules in place but... I think society will be a lot more normal."" Meanwhile, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said it was wrong to speculate on whether summer holidays will be allowed this year: ""I get how frustrating this is, it's completely natural. We all want to get a break from this, I get that. But it would wrong for me to start speculating now. ""We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that."" A continued fall in new infections is one of the reassuring signs PM Boris Johnson will be considering this weekend, along with advisers, to decide if, when and how to start lifting some restrictions in England. R is below 1, even with more infectious variants of the virus circulating, which is good news too. But within the wider UK figures there are some regional differences that are worth keeping an eye on. Infection rates appear to be higher in some urban areas of England, for example. Lessons from last year tell us that the virus can take off again if you unlock too quickly or too soon. 'One size fits all' may not be the best approach for every type of easing, although a shared priority is to get children back to school. VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

"G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine schemeIt comes days after the UN chief condemned vaccine distribution as ""wildly uneven and unfair"".World","Leaders of the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy and Japan held a virtual summit G7 leaders have pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19 and increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. In a joint statement released after a virtual summit on Friday,G7 leaders raised their overall commitment to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn),external. Wealthy countries are facing growing pressure to make sure lower-income nations get fair access to vaccines. President Joe Biden has pledged $4bn in US aid to the fund. An initial $2bn will be donated in 2021, with an additional $2bn coming over the next two years. Germany pledged an additional $1.2bn with Chancellor Angela Merkel telling journalists: ""I stressed in my intervention that the pandemic is not over until all people in the world have been vaccinated.""

The Covax scheme  isaiming to get at least 1.3bn vaccine doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months,external. Covax is co-led by Gavi, known as the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday he was grateful for  the new commitments but  emphasised that more was needed to address the world's vaccination imbalance. ""Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing to do,"" he said at the annual Munich Security Conference, also held virtually on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron is among world leaders calling for further actionto address the world's vaccine imbalance - saying Europe and the US should urgently send up to 5% of their supplies to developing nations. This video can not be played The chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, on the need for a worldwide effort on vaccinations The new commitments come days after UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Friday's online meeting was the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this year's G7 chair, has said thatthe UK will donate much of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer nations. To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according tofigures from Johns Hopkins University,external. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.

Four can meet for exercise in Wales from SaturdayThe changes come as the first minister says lockdown's stay home message may end in three weeks.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"".

Lockdown-ease 'based on continuing case-rate fall',"This video can not be played More children could return to schools, visits to care homes and weddings could also take place if case rates continue to fall, says the first minister. Mark Drakeford said on Friday that while the ""overarching stay at home measures"" will remain in place, ""very modest changes to the regulations"" could happen over the next few weeks. Andrew RT Davies, the Senedd Leader for Welsh Conservatives said he welcomes the news around education but that is it ""regrettable"" that the first minister did not give more details on reopening of shops or future financial support. Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said ""a cautious, step by step, phased approch is absolutely the right way to approach things"".

"LiveLiveWhole world must be vaccinated, Johnson tells G72 minutes ago","""We've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic,"" UK PM Boris Johnson tells a meeting of the G7 nations The G7 leaders have agreed to ""intensify co-operation"" in their response to the pandemic Ursula von der Leyen announces the EU is doubling its contribution to the Covax global Covid-19 vaccination programme Another 533 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and there are 12,027 new cases reported About 1 in 115 people were estimated to have coronavirus in the UK in the week to 12 February, the ONS says, with rates falling in all four UK nations The UK's R number is between 0.6 and 0.9, according to latest government estimates Health Secretary Matt Hancock acted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contracts signed during the pandemic, a court rules The Welsh government is making ""modest changes"" to lockdown regulations, including weddings resuming next week Edited by Katie Wright Thatâs all for now, thanks for joining us. Weâll be back
with more coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Todayâs live page was brought to
you by Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, James Clarke, Jo Couzens, Katie Wright and
Victoria Lindrea. Weâll be ending our live coverage shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Northern Ireland Assembly members will be able totake part remotely in assembly proceedings for the first time from Monday, according to a letter from the Speaker Alex Maskey sent today. Maskey asked assembly members (MLAs) to be patient as there could be ""teething problems"" in adapting to the new system. He also said MLAs should ensure they participate remotely from a location with ""good connectivity"". Some assembly members had called for remote proceedings, due to the pandemic. Avirtual system was set up at Westminsterlast year. Photos posted on Facebook allegedly showed Aftab Razaq attending the ceremony A Manchester councillor accused of breaching Covid restrictions by flying to Pakistan and attending a wedding has been suspended by the local Labour Party. Photos were shared on Facebook last weekend allegedly showingManchester City Councillor Aftab Razaqat the celebration in the city of Kharian. Under the current Covid-19 rules in the UK, it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfor holidays and other leisure purposes. Mr Razaq, 52, has yet to respond to the BBC's request for a comment. He was seen in the photos apparently ignoring social distancing and not wearing a mask, despite virus rules in Pakistan making this mandatory. It was initially believed that the virus originated at a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan In his interview with the BBC, the US Secretary of State has also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. Anthony Blinkenaccused China of failing to share informationthat might shed light on the origins of Covid-19. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. Blinken said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. This video can not be played US is 'determined to engage in the world' - Blinken ""America is back"" and fully engaged in helping resolve global issues including the pandemic,US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tells the BBC. In his first international interview, Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19, marking a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Blinken said. The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. With thousands of schools still closed around the world, there are increasingly urgent warnings of the impact of the pandemic on millions of children. In the video below, Ros Atkins looks at risks of re-opening and of not doing so. This video can not be played Ros Atkins onâ¦ COVID-19 and the schools crisis It would be ""reckless"" to bring back all pupils in England to school together on 8 March, saysa joint statement by teachers' unions. Rather than risk another ""spike"" in infections, they are calling for a more ""cautious"" and ""phased"" return. Nine teachers and head teachers' unions have urged the government to commit to that date only if the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe. The prime minister is due to announce the plan for reopening schools on Monday. The collective statement from education unions says they are committed to bringing children back into the classroom as soon as possible - but have concerns it may lead to another surge in the virus. They say they are ""increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March"" - the government's target for opening schools. Here's a reminder of a few changes to lockdown restrictions in Wales announced in a press conference earlier by First Minister Mark Drakeford: Here's all you need to know about how Wales' rules are being loosened. The UK government'spledge to donate most of any surplus vaccine supply to poorer countrieshas been welcomed by Jose Manuel Barroso, chairman of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. He told BBC World News he was hopeful the virtual meeting of the G7 group of major economies would aid the process further. This video can not be played Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A single dose of the Pfizer
vaccine prevented 85% of symptomatic Covid infections in healthcare workers at
one of Israel's largest hospitals. And, compared with a group of
people who hadnât had the vaccine yet, there were 75% fewer infections overall
â  including those that didn't cause any symptoms. The analysis was based on more
than 9,000 staff members, 15-28 days after their first dose. The authors said it provided
""support"" to delaying the second dose in countries facing vaccine
shortages. The UK opted to give more people
one dose of the vaccine, rather than a smaller group two doses three weeks
apart. The NHS still plans to offer
second doses within 12 weeks. The argument was that, in the
face of very high cases, this would save more lives and protect more people
from severe disease. Although a relatively small
piece of analysis, it appears to offer some vindication to this strategy. It suggests just one dose â once
you wait the roughly two weeks it takes for protection to kick in - gave a very
high level of protection against disease. And it gave significant protection
against even carrying the virus. The researchers looked at days
15-28 after one dose of the vaccine, since thatâs the period after immunity has
begun to develop but before a second dose has had time to take effect. In Israel, second doses are
being given around the 21-day mark and are expected to take effect after about
a week - less time than the first dose takes because the immune system has
already been primed. The country has more or less
unfettered access to all the vaccine it needs, since it has struck a deal with
manufacturer in exchange for handing over large amounts of data, allowing Pfizer
to monitor how well it is working in a whole population. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in the UK has fallen below 20,000 for the first time since December, with the latest figuresreporting 19,392 hospital cases,external. The last time the figures dropped below this threshold was 20 December, when there were 19,455 people in hospital with Covid. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport While Covid-19 vaccine passports are ""feasible"", we need to know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said. They also have thepotential to discriminateagainst the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons. This must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report. It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan, including having a way to accommodate ""changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants"". And a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws. It is also vital to be clear about what the passports would be used for - whether that's international travel or greater domestic freedoms - the report outlined. Some countries in the world have ordered enough coronavirus jabs to vaccinate their population many times over. The graphic below details which have over-ordered vaccines - and which don't have enough. Oxfam saysthe steps taken by the G7 in terms of co-ordinating a joint Covid responseare welcome but still remain ""insufficient when compared to the scale of the Covid-19 threat"". In a statement, Max Lawson, Oxfam Head of Inequality Policy, said: ""Making huge parts of Africa and Asia wait for unwanted, leftover vaccines
from rich countriesâ stocks is not just immoral, it is irresponsible. And the
lack of coordinated action from the G7 is inexcusable. ""The longer huge swathes
of the worldâs population are denied protection, the greater the threat that
virus mutations will threaten us all. âPoor countries should not be forced to wait for vaccines to trickle down to
them. Between them, G7 nations have secured enough vaccines for every one of
their citizens to be vaccinated three times over, while many poor countries are
yet to receive a single dose. âThe G7 urgently needs to get its priorities straight during this
unprecedented pandemic and stop putting the profits of big pharma ahead of a
peopleâs vaccine.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ski slopes in Poland, such as this one in Szczyrk, reopened last Friday The South African variant of coronavirus has been detected in Poland as the health minister Adam Niedzielski confirmed a third wave has arrived in the country. The first case of the variant was discovered near the city of Suwalki in north-eastern Poland, Niedzielski says. About 10% of Covid-19 cases in Poland are now the UK variant. Niedzielski says there has been a very dynamic increase in new infections in the past two weeks. ""Looking at the results it must be said that the third wave of the pandemic is already in Poland,"" he tells a news conference. The seven-day average this week exceeded 6,500 cases, he says, 1,000 more than in previous weeks. He also says the number of patients requiring hospital treatment, which had been decreasing, has reversed in the past week. The trend reversal comes just a week after Poland allowed ski slopes to reopen, as well as hotels, cinemas and theatres reopening at half capacity. Officials have said restrictions would be reinstated if cases rise significantly. On Friday, Poland reported 8,777 new cases in the previous 24 hours and 241 virus-related deaths. The number of new daily cases this week has been the highest in more than a month. Poland has vaccinated 2.56 million people, equivalent to 6.8% of the population, including 865,884 people who has received both doses, or 2.3% of the population. The number of people living in poverty in Indonesia has grown by more than 10% since the pandemic began in 2020, statistics show Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell has urged the government to think again about cutting the aid budget, saying he was ""far from sure"" the House of Commons would back the move in the middle of the pandemic. The Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One: âA very large number of colleagues on all sides of the House of Commons think this is not the time to cut aid and development."" If the cut went ahead, Mr Mitchell said the UK ""would have to stop making a lot of the planned vaccinations, cut the number of girls going to school, the number of people getting access to clean water"". ""A cut like that would lead to hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths mainly amongst children,â he added. He pointed out that where all other G7 countries were increasing aid, the UK - which is currently hosting a G7 meeting, was the only country proposing a cut. ""Iâm sure that the government will want to think again about this and I think the House of Commons is likely to insist that the government does."" Boris Johnson hosted the virtual meeting of G7 leaders The leaders of the G7 nations have agreed to ""intensify co-operation"" in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Following a virtual meeting hosted by Boris Johnson, they pledged to work together and with the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate global vaccine development and deployment. In a joint statement, they said: ""We reaffirm our support for all pillars of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), its Covax facility, and affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" They announced increased financial commitments totalling US$7.5bn (Â£5.3bn). The statement continued: ""We invite all partners, including the G20 and international financial institutions, to join us in increasing support to ACT-A, including to increase developing countries' access to WHO-approved vaccines through the Covax facility. ""Covid-19 shows that the world needs stronger defences against future risks to global health security."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data put forward by Pfizer-BioNTech suggests their Covid
vaccine could be stored at slightly warmer temperatures for a certain period of time,
making it easier to store and transport. Currently, the vaccine needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures - between -80C and -60C - which has meant special containers are required to
move shipments around. It can then be kept in a fridge for five days before being used. Now the company says its vaccine remains stable when stored
at -25C to -15C - the temperature of pharmaceutical
freezers - for two weeks. This could take place instead of, or alongside, storage at the very low
temperatures, giving GPs, pharmacies and vaccination centres more
flexibility in how they manage their supplies. It may also make providing this vaccine to populations
across the world a little less daunting. One advantage of the Oxford-AZ vaccine has always been that
it can be stored at the same temperature as a household fridge. The data collected by Pfizer has been handed to the US
authorities and it would need to be run past other regulators in other
countries too before any rules around the vaccine's storage could be changed. As of Thursday, some 16,875,536 people in the UK had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, up by 452,454 doses on the previous day. And 589,591 had received a second dose, up by 15,867 on the previous day. Returning to the UK's other daily figures, the number of cases - 12,027 - is down by just over 20% on last Friday, and the number of deaths - 533 - is down by nearly 30%. The figures for Wednesday and Thursday this week were both close to the level seen on the previous week, but that hasnât kept going today, BBC News head of statistics Robert Cuffe says. The rolling seven day averages are also down - 20% and 28% respectively. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine schemeIt comes days after the UN chief condemned vaccine distribution as ""wildly uneven and unfair"".","Leaders of the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy and Japan held a virtual summit G7 leaders have pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19 and increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. In a joint statement released after a virtual summit on Friday,G7 leaders raised their overall commitment to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn),external. Wealthy countries are facing growing pressure to make sure lower-income nations get fair access to vaccines. President Joe Biden has pledged $4bn in US aid to the fund. An initial $2bn will be donated in 2021, with an additional $2bn coming over the next two years.

The Covax scheme  isaiming to get at least 1.3bn vaccine doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months,external. Covax is co-led by Gavi, known as the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday he was grateful for  the new commitments but  emphasised that more was needed to address the world's vaccination imbalance. ""Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing to do,"" he said at the annual Munich Security Conference, also held virtually on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron is among world leaders calling for further actionto address the world's vaccine imbalance - saying Europe and the US should urgently send up to 5% of their supplies to developing nations. This video can not be played The chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, on the need for a worldwide effort on vaccinations The new commitments come days after UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Friday's online meeting was the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this year's G7 chair, has said thatthe UK will donate much of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer nations. To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according tofigures from Johns Hopkins University,external. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.

"Dental schools will not take new studentsUniversities Scotland says it is a ""sad, knock-on effect"" of dental students having to repeat a year.Scotland","Dental students have been unable to get face-to-face patient contact during the pandemic Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year. It was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic. Graduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year. Universities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year. A spokesman said: ""Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training. ""All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022. ""Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted."" Scotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year. The same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas. Savanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen. Her graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming. The reality, however, was still overwhelming. ""Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,"" she said. She conceded that the dental school being closed ""did have quite an impact"" on learning, as practical work was not possible. And there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. ""Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,"" she said. Ms Joyce said: ""I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended. ""We are all very accepting of the decisions,"" she added. The British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places. They said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come. David McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year. ""What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,"" he said. ""We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form. ""If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry."" At Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an ""inevitable and pragmatic decision"" to extend the training programme of existing dental students. He said: ""I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training.""

Swann downplays easing of restrictions for EasterA further five Covid-19 linked deaths and 313 new cases are reported by the Department of Health in NI.Northern IrelandComments,"Restrictions were imposed in Northern Ireland on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19 Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of lockdown restrictions being eased in time for Easter. On Thursday,the executive extended restrictions until 1 April. A review of the current measures will take place on 18 March. Five more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Friday, bringing its total number of deaths to 2,026. It also recorded another 313 positive cases. Robin Swann reiterated that the pathway-to-recovery roadmap on easing restrictions, due to be published on 1 March, will be linked to data as opposed to specific dates. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: ""One of the approaches the executive made in the first wave was to follow the data, not the dates and that approach has been replicated in other jurisdictions. ""So the roadmap will set a trajectory that won't be tied to dates and will be very clear about following the science."" The current restrictions were imposed in Northern Ireland on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19. Mr Swann said the health service is currently supporting more Covid-19 inpatients than at the peak of the first wave. ""So there would be no point in saying that where we will be in a number of weeks time will be far better than where we were at the same period of the first wave,"" he said. There are 403 people with Covid-19 in hospitals across Northern Ireland, of which 49 are being treated in intensive care and 41 have been ventilated. However, the vaccine does provide more cause for hope of recovery in this wave, the health minister added. On Friday afternoon it was announced that all carers over the age of 18 can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended. Previously only carers over 50 were eligible, but Mr Swann said he had decided to remove the age criteria and ""open this up to all carers"".Â ""If you are a carer of someone who is elderly or disabled, you can now book your vaccine online at one of the seven trust centres,"" he said. The latest NI Department of Health figures show that as of Friday, 466,524 vaccines have been administered, of which 436,143 were first doses and 30,381 were second doses. On Thursday, Mr Swann said he hoped to expandNorthern Ireland's vaccine programmeto carers of all ages soon. Speaking on Friday morning, he said: ""That will be the difference this time around that we didn't have last time - that extra support that the vaccine is actually bringing. ""But we're balancing hope with caution. Anything we're doing now will be reviewed on 18 March. ""The figures are moving in the right direction, but they started from a very high point this time around."" Mr Swann said the vaccine programme is beginning to make a difference. ""It's really starting to make progress in the over 75s, but it takes time for that vaccine to have the positive impact it needs to have."" The health minister said the vaccine programme is beginning to make a difference Health officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March. Mr Swann said there was ""a realisation across the executive table that if we take [easing lockdown] on a measured basis, we won't end up going back... into full lockdown in a few months time"". The head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black, told BBC Radio Foyle it would have been difficult to justify further lifting of lockdown measures when the number of infections and hospital inpatients remains high.""We are half way down the slope, but have another few weeks of work to do,"" Dr Black said.""We can't afford to ease up for St Patrick's Day, we can't ease up for Easter. ""This continued lockdown is what is going to free up the summer, this is giving you the opportunity for some normality during summer."" It is planned that a limited number of year groups will go back to class on 8 March On Thursday, it was announced thatpre-school, nursery and primary school pupils in P1 to P3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March. They will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays. Mr Swann said: ""From a health point of view, it's about seeing a cohort to return for a few weeks and allowing us to asses what impact that has had on transmission and the R number."" He added that the decision over which year group returned was ""not something [the Department of Health] would get involved in"".

Those services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops. From that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households.

Janice Gault said early closing times had a significant impact on trading viability Its 'Return to Trading' plan sets out eight requests for the executive to consider, including the removal of the earlier closing time of 23:00 for hospitality, which was in force before the lockdown was imposed. The body's chief executive, Janice Gault, said the restriction had ""little effect on the spread of the virus, but has significant impact on the viability of trading"". She said extension of a reduction in VAT to 5% beyond 31 March was imperative and called for an extension of business rates relief for the next financial year, as well as a ""staged and controlled end"" to the furlough scheme.

"UK sees further drop in coronavirus numbersDaily figures show a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus were recorded in the UK on Friday.HealthComments","Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK,Office for National Statistics,externaldata shows. The figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks. Experts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus. And another 533 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. It brings the UK total to 119,920. Daily figures show there were a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Friday. More than 16.8 million people have had their first COVID vaccine dose, while 589,591 have had a second jab, bringing the total number of shots since the rollout began to nearly 17.5m. Thelatest R number,external, estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people. Other studies of infection rateshave shown a similar ""strong"" decline. The ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest: One in 115 people in England has the virus (compared to one in 80 the week before) In Northern Ireland, it is one in 105 (compared to one in 75 previously) In Wales, it is one in 125 (compared to one in 85 before) In Scotland, it is one in 180 (compared to one in 150) In England, there is some regional variation in the infection rate, although it is decreasing in all areas. North-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus - at around one in 85 people. For London the estimate was one in 100, and for the West Midlands it was one in 110. Elsewhere, the estimates are: one in 120 people for the East Midlands and for Yorkshire and the Humber one in 125 people for eastern England one in 135 for north-east England, south-east England and south-west England It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. Downing Streethas refused to commenton the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation. The Welsh government has alreadyannounced some changes. From Saturday, four people from two different households will be allowed to exercise outdoors together. And from Monday, children in Wales aged between three and seven are returning to school - as are young children inScotland. Experts say any unlocking should be done slowly and cautiously to avoid a rebound surge in cases. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people can catch. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling prompted the first lockdown last March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was hopeful more restrictions could be lifted by the end of May. ""We will still have rules in place but... I think society will be a lot more normal."" Meanwhile, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said it was wrong to speculate on whether summer holidays will be allowed this year: ""I get how frustrating this is, it's completely natural. We all want to get a break from this, I get that. But it would wrong for me to start speculating now. ""We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that."" A continued fall in new infections is one of the reassuring signs PM Boris Johnson will be considering this weekend, along with advisers, to decide if, when and how to start lifting some restrictions in England. R is below 1, even with more infectious variants of the virus circulating, which is good news too. But within the wider UK figures there are some regional differences that are worth keeping an eye on. Infection rates appear to be higher in some urban areas of England, for example. Lessons from last year tell us that the virus can take off again if you unlock too quickly or too soon. 'One size fits all' may not be the best approach for every type of easing, although a shared priority is to get children back to school. VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

WhatsApp to go ahead with changes despite backlash,"Millions of users flocked to other messaging platforms in January WhatsApp is pushing ahead with controversial changes to its terms of service, but altering the way it notifies users following a backlash. After its first announcement in January,millions of users downloaded apps from WhatsApp's competitors. The Facebook-owned platform previously said it had been the victim of ""misinformation"" around the change. But WhatsApp now says it has ""reflected"" on how it could have explained the changes better. The phrasing of the warning in the initial pushled to widespread fears that it was going to share large amounts of WhatsApp data with Facebook. In reality, very little had changed in that area - and almost all users had previously accepted the type of data sharing involved. As part of its second attempt to convince users, WhatsApp will begin displaying a banner alert within the app in the coming weeks. The in-app banner will lead to more detailed explanations for users It encourages users to learn more about the update and what is - and is not - changing. Messages informing users of the update will also be displayed in the status section of the app. The new terms are scheduled to come into effect on 15 May. WhatsApp says,externalthe data it shares with its parent company does not include messages, groups or call logs. Instead, it says the new terms focus on changes to allow users to message businesses. WhatsApp already shares information with Facebook, such as your IP address and information about your phone, as well as purchases made via the platform. However this does not apply in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist. But privacy experts say the saga highlights how unaware users are of how their data is being used. ""In its efforts to clarify that [it] isn't doing anything wrong, Whatsapp has in fact inadvertently highlighted that it was already harvesting huge amounts of data for Facebook,"" said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. That ""vindicates"" those who decided to leave Whatsapp, he said. ""The biggest takeaway from all of this is that Whatsapp was already harvesting device level identifiers, IP addresses, and purchase info on behalf of Facebook - and that until recent media attention, the general public was largely unaware."" Signal messaging service restored after outage US regulators open privacy probes into tech giants Whatsapp said it had ""reflected on what we could have done better here"". âWe want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption, and trust weâre committed to protecting peopleâs privacy and security."" It also said it will ""be doing much more"" to be clear about changes in the future. In January, government officials in India asked the messaging giant to withdraw its planned changes. The country is currently WhatsApp's largest market with more than 340 million users.

Uber drivers are workers not self-employed,"Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning Â£30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than Â£1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability. Tom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time. He thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications,externalfor a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers. ""The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing.

As for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016. ""Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,"" she said. Dr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees. He told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these ""rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals"".

UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations,"Boris Johnson speaks to G7 leaders by video link Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement,externalcommitting to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Timesricher countries should send up to 4 to 5%of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this. A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

Uber drivers are workers not self-employedThe decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are set to receive minimum wage and holiday pay.,"Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning Â£30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than Â£1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability. Tom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time.

Wales' stay-at-home rules may end in March,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Dental schools will not take new students,"Dental students have been unable to get face-to-face patient contact during the pandemic Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year. It was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic. Graduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year. Universities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year. A spokesman said: ""Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training. ""All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022. ""Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted."" Scotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year. The same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas. Savanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen. Her graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming. The reality, however, was still overwhelming. ""Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,"" she said. She conceded that the dental school being closed ""did have quite an impact"" on learning, as practical work was not possible. And there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. ""Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,"" she said. Ms Joyce said: ""I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended. ""We are all very accepting of the decisions,"" she added. The British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places. They said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come. David McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year. ""What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,"" he said. ""We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form. ""If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry."" At Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an ""inevitable and pragmatic decision"" to extend the training programme of existing dental students. He said: ""I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training."" Mr Swinney said he would be discussing the issues with the dental schools and the British Dental Association. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nationsBoris Johnson is encouraging other rich countries to donate vaccine doses at a virtual G7 meeting.,"Boris Johnson speaks to G7 leaders by video link Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement,externalcommitting to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Timesricher countries should send up to 4 to 5%of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this. A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

LiveLiveNew exercise and wedding rules after lockdown reviewLess than a minute agoNow GoodbyeGoodbye13 minutes ago Gyms still pose 'superspreader risk'Gyms still pose 'superspreader risk'24 minutes ago Plaid worried about 'effect of new variants'Plaid worried about 'effect of new variants',"From Saturday, the number of people who can exercise together will increase from two to four From 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen, in line with current rules for register offices Primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen then The Conservatives have called for a ""road map to recovery"" but Plaid Cymru say a ""stay local"" message is needed for as long as necessary James McCarthy and Ben Frampton That's it from the coronavirus live page for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the main points:  Gyms could still pose a risk of so-called âsuperspreader eventsâ where many people catch Covid at the same time, according to scientific advice provided to ministers. Mr Drakeford confirmed the current advice was that gyms should stay shut, particularly given the rise of new, more easily transmitted variants of the virus. âI certainly donât anticipate gyms re-opening, certainly not in the next three weeks,â he said. âBut evidence will accumulate over the weeks ahead, as we gradually allow more things to open, whether or not allowing people to get together, with the new Kent variant will allow the virus to come back at a very quick rate. âIf it doesnât, then the Technical Advisory Cell (of scientific advisers) will revisit its advice, and we will see whatâs able to be done.â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says he is worried about Covid variants, but the âdirection of travel is an incredibly positive one"". âThe one source of uncertainty, of course, is the effect of these new variants,"" he said. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today. âThe government's own advisors, as well as the TAC (Technical Advisory Cell) report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths. âSo we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales."" Teachers union the NASUWT has criticised the decision begin reopening schools. General secretary Dr Patrick Roach warned the âsituation on public health and in transmission of the virus remains incredibly fragile and precarious."" He said: âIn making the decision to proceed with the phased wider return to school for some pupils, the Welsh Government has not demonstrated that its decisions will not undermine the health and safety of school staff and pupils or undermine efforts to reduce levels of virus transmission in the community. ""Schools, teachers and parents need to have compelling evidence that this will not be the case. ""Unless that evidence is clear, an announcement now for a wider reopening of schools is premature."" However, Tory leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the move, but is concerned not enough is being done for businesses. âI welcome the news on education because we know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and studentsâ educational pathway,"" he said. âWhat I think is regrettable is that the first minister didnât open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work. âI think that's an opportunity thatâs been missed.â The first minister says heâs âkeen to learn the lessonsâ from
lifting lockdown restrictions after the first wave of Covid-19. Mark Drakeford says there were things that âworked well thenâ
but âwe can do things better.â His comments came after he was asked whether more
support should be made available for businesses forced to shut for lockdown. âI know that what businesses in Wales want is not more money
from the government - what they want is to be able to open and have a thriving
business in the way that they had this time last year. âI've indicated today that we will be talking with
non-essential retail and close personal services that are closed at the moment
to see if it's possible for anything to resume in three weeksâ time. âLast time we opened hairdressers first and then other
services of a similar sort - nail bars and so on - followed a couple of weeks
later."" But lifting lockdown will not be driven just by
figures, Mr Drakeford said. He told the coronavirus press
briefing that he will take ""a judgment in the round, informed by the
advice of our senior clinicians and scientific advisers"". He said the government would continue to look
at benchmarks such as ""the number of people (with coronavirus) per
100,000"" as well as positivity rates, the R number and the impact of coronavirus on hospitals. ""We will then look at all of that as a
package and take advice from those who are responsible for our health service,
and who model for us the way coronavirus is spreading in Wales. ""And when we
take all of that together, the cabinet will make a judgment on what is possible
in three weeks' time.""  The Welsh Retail Consortium has welcomed the ""glimmer of hope"" that shops will soon be able to reopen. Consortium chief Sara Jones said: ""Many retailers have been hit hardest in this third, and
hopefully final, lockdown and today we have a glimmer of hope that we will soon
be able to reopen our doors to the Welsh public once more. âSo-called non-essential shops are well placed to reopen
safely and should be trusted to do so, as they did so successfully at the end
of the national lockdown last June and again at the end of the firebreak."" ""Retailers
have been playing their part to make stores safe, spending many millions of
pounds on coronavirus safety measures, including implementing social distancing
measures and increased cleaning procedures. âItâs therefore
essential the Welsh Government maintains it commitment to prioritising
the re-opening of our high streets, whilst outlining an ongoing economic
stimulus package to encourage consumers to start shopping again and providing
an immediate statement on business rates relief post March."" Ministers want to avoid a âstop-startâ situation where pubs re-open and then have to close again, Mr Drakeford said. The first minister held talks with industry figures yesterday, but there is no date set yet for when pubs, bars and restaurants might be able to open their doors. He said hospitality venues were not likely to reopen for at least another six weeks. âOf course we listen to, and engage and talk with, the sector but I just have to explain to them, as I do to many other businesses who are of course desperately anxious to resume, that the only way we will succeed in getting them back trading is if we approach the reopening of our economy and our society in a way that is careful, that is step-by-step and allows us always to review the impact of any action we take on the circulation of the virus. âToo much too soon will simply return us to the very difficult days we sawâ¦ before Christmas. The other thing that the hospitality industry said to me yesterday is what they donât want is stop-start. âThey donât want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close.â Mr Drakeford said if circulation of the Covid
virus continued to decrease, that a ""modest resumption"" in the
tourism industry might be possible. He said he'd met tourism bosses yesterday
and told them ""they are not likely to see a reopening at either of
the next two, three-week review periods"". Infections are continuing to
fall in Wales, according to the most recent Office for National Statistics survey. It tookthroat and nose swab tests from
hundreds of households in Wales. From the results, it can
estimate that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 12 February, a
decrease on the previous survey a week ago. This is one in 125 people - down
from one in 85 people - or 0.81%, down from 1.16% of the population. The survey is seen as a useful
way of looking at the pandemic's progress because although numbers are limited,
it picks up people who are asymptomatic. When broken down into health
board areas, the household survey results led to infection estimates ranging
from one in 125 people in Aneurin Bevan to one in 185 in Swansea Bay. But these
are based on much smaller sample sizes. The modelling was based on swab
tests from 20,580 people over six weeks from 10,734 households. Mr Drakeford says the next review of restrictions will be in the week beginning 8 March and - once again - the priority will be on getting children back to school. He says he thinks he will continue to take âa careful and cautious approach - as we have throughout the pandemic - guided by what the experts tell usâ. âGetting more children and young people back to school and college will be our priority. âIf things remain on track, our aim is for all primary school children to return to face-to-face learning from 15 March. âWe also want to get some older learners - such as years 11 and 13 in schools and those doing qualifications in colleges - back on a blended learning basis."" Mr Drakeford says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 for the first time since early December and the number of people with coronavirus in intensive care is 50% lower than at the peak of the pandemic. He said âreally good progressâ was being made on the vaccination programme âthanks to the enormous efforts of everyone involved across Walesâ. ""The very latest figures show almost 840,000 people have had their first dose â this is equivalent of a third of the adult population of Wales.â ""This week we started offering people appointments for second doses and more than 25,000 people have had theirs already. ""Weâre on track to reach the next milestone of offering vaccination to everyone in priority groups five to nine by the end of April, provided vaccine supplies remain on course."" The First Minister says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 Weddings and civil partnerships are to be allowed from next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We will change the law to allow licenced
wedding venues, such as visitor attractions and hotels, to re-open but only to
perform wedding and civil partnership ceremonies. ""And, as
more people living and working (in) care homes are vaccinated, we will look again at
our guidance for visiting."" He hoped to see cases continue to fall in the coming weeks. As many as four people from two different homes will be able to exercise together from Saturday. Mark Drakeford says the Welsh Government is now able to make ""modest changes"" to lockdown regulations and taking ""some first cautious steps to relax some of the strictest lockdown restrictions we have all been living with for so long"". He said at a press conference: ""From
tomorrow, we will change the rules to allow up to four people from two
different households to exercise outdoors together, helping people who have
been struggling with lockdown. ""But this does
not mean you can now drive somewhere to exercise and it does not mean
socialising."" Most council meetings in one Welsh county could remain virtual, post Covid-19, in a bid tocut down on travel and improve diversity. Before the pandemic, Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon, resulting in a three-hour round trip for some. Now plans have been outlined to allow councillors to take part in debates from their homes for years to come. A report to councillors said virtual meetings had become the ""new normal"" and that continuing the virtual meetings would cut travel and reduce the council's carbon footprint and encourage more people to stand for election by making meetings more accessible,the Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. Before the pandemic Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon A further 16 people have died with coronavirus in Wales,according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths to 5,205. There have also been a further 533 cases reported, making Wales' overall case rate 84 for every 100,000 people. The total number of people who have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine is now 839,065. Second Covid jab doses have been given to 25,433 people. Wales' first minister says he hopes this will bethe last three weeks of the ""stay-at-home"" requirement. Mark Drakeford said any change depended on case rates falling and it was too soon to say if people would be able to travel beyond their local area. He also said he hoped primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March if Covid cases continued to fall. Talks will begin with non-essential shops about the prospects of reopening. Mr Drakeford said: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.""

Ted Cruz flew to Mexico as Texans froze in storms,"Senator Ted Cruz takes questions at the Cancun airport on 18 February Texas Senator Ted Cruz has attempted to defend taking a family trip to Mexico amid a winter storm that left millions in his state without power and water. Mr Cruz said on Thursday he planned the holiday for his daughters, ""wanting to be a good dad"", but had returned because it ""didn't feel right"". Photos of the Republican lawmaker at an airport on Wednesday fuelled outrage at how he had left Texas during a crisis. Millions of people in Texas face water shortages, with reservoirs near empty. Freezing temperatures have caused power blackouts at water treatment facilities and burst water pipes supplying homes, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets. About 13 million Texans have been told to boil water that may be contaminated. Texas residents told to boil water in winter storm Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now The moment the crowd turned on Ted Cruz Mr Cruz, a high-profile Republican who ran for the US presidency in 2016, has not only drawn criticism for taking the international trip, but also for reportedly leaving his dog, Snowflake, behind. A New York Magazine reporter tweeted an image early on Thursday that appeared to show the senator's home, with Snowflake visible through the glass of the front door. Allow Twitter content?

The canine was reportedly being cared for by a security guard. In a written statement released on Thursday afternoon, Mr Cruz said that with schools closed in the state, he had booked the vacation for his young daughters who ""asked to take a trip with friends"". The senator said he and his staff were ""in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas"". Mr Cruz did not apologise for making the trip amid the state of emergency in Texas, butin a later interview with broadcaster ABC13, he said it was ""a mistake"",external. ""In hindsight, if I had understood how it would be perceived, the reaction people would have, obviously I wouldn't have done it,"" he said, adding that he had had ""second thoughts as soon as we left"" and understood why people were ""upset"". ""Leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn't feel right, and so I changed my return flight and flew back on the first available flight I could take,"" he said. Mr Cruz returned to Texas on Thursday The Republican has now returned to Houston. As a federal lawmaker, Mr Cruz does not have a direct role in Texas' emergency response, but residents often reach out to their elected officials - like Mr Cruz - during natural disasters for help accessing resources. The senator's travel plans amid the crisis in Texas drew immediate criticism online. ""People in Texas are literally freezing to death and yet Ted Cruz went on vacation to Cancun,"" wrote Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal on Twitter. ""Ted Cruz not only fled the state while millions of vulnerable Texans are without heat and water but specifically diverted police resources to get him through security and crowds faster for his outgoing vacation flight,"" wrote progressive rights activist Charlotte Clymer on Twitter.

Some criticised Mr Cruz for appearing to use his daughters to deflect blame. Journalist Leah Binkovitz appeared to mock the senator, writing on Twitter: ""I relate to Ted Cruz because my kids have also asked tough questions of me lately like, 'what happens if we run out of food and water'."" The chairman of the Republican Party in Texas, Allen West, said Mr Cruz ""has to answer to his constituents"" for the decisions he has made during the current winter weather crisis. But some conservatives came to Mr Cruz's defence - author and activist Brigitte Gabriel wrote: ""Senator Ted Cruz is one of the hardest working men in the country, he deserves a vacation."" Mr Cruz's trip to Mexico also raised concerns among other parents whose children attend the same private school in Houston as his daughters. The school's policy states thatstudents who travel abroad cannot return to classrooms for seven days,externalafter returning home, the New York Times reported. It adds that students must take a coronavirus test within three to five days of returning, which must then produce a negative result before they can return to classrooms. Others suggested the added scrutiny may hurt Mr Cruz as he reportedly contemplates a second presidential bid in 2024. The lawmaker's current Senate term will expire in early 2025. At least 47 storm-related deaths have been reported and hospitals have been placed under severe pressure. Food supplies in supermarkets are running low and residents are struggling to keep warm in some of the coldest temperatures the state has seen in more than 30 years - hitting 0F (-18C) earlier this week. Texas family 'trying to keep warm' Texas has opted out of the national power grids, and so has been particularly hard hit by the exceptional conditions. Outages are expected to continue for days. This video can not be played 'Heâs 92 so we wrapped him tight like a mummy' Governor Greg Abbott has asked residents to shut off water to their home if possible to help keep pressure up amid concerns over the disruption in supply to hospitals. Mr Cruz had been active on Twitter in recent days, sharing updates about power in the state. In his Thursday statement, Mr Cruz said that his family had also lost heat and power, just like other Texans. ""The greatest state in the greatest country in the world has been without power,"" he said.

All dental students forced to repeat a year,"All dental students in Scotland will have to repeat a year after their training was disrupted by Covid. Scotland's dental schools said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she understood how disappointing it would be for students across the country. She said the Scottish government was determined to support students and was providing extra bursary payments. The bursaries will be the equivalent of a student loan award which could be up to Â£6,750, she said. Dentists 'may have to close' without more support NHS dentistry returns but no 'business as usual' Mrs Freeman said the decision to make the students repeat a year was a ""tough one"". ""It is about giving dental students the experience that has been denied them this year because of the pandemic,"" she said. ""We need to ensure that people studying dentistry can enter the profession as confident fully-qualified clinicians."" Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow Dental Schools have all taken the decision to defer graduations. They said the students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. 'Disillusioned' dentists join growing dental group My NHS dentist can fix my son's teeth - if we go private Graduation for students at Dundee and Glasgow Dental Schools will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the 2020-21 academic year. Graduation for students in the final year at Aberdeen will be deferred until Christmas 2021 and all other students will repeat the 2020-21 academic year. Prof Phil Taylor, who is dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said he understood and supported the decision taken by Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow dental schools. He said: ""Patient safety is always at the forefront of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh's actions and this decision supports our efforts in this respect. ""Dentistry as a profession has been uniquely disadvantaged throughout the pandemic in comparison to other primary care services due to the lack of meaningful support made available for the sector, and this is one of the many resulting knock-on effects. ""I sincerely hope dental students are able to obtain a high standard of practical training and experience as part of their studies over the course of the coming academic year, which will benefit the dental profession as a whole going forward."" Student leaders also welcomed the bursaries but asked for clarity from the Scottish government to ensure all students could benefit from support. Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said: ""The marketisation of universities means many students have to pay astronomical fees to access education, it is only right these dentistry students should be given full compensation."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""It is a big blow to people who would have been in their final year and who had been hoping to get into employment very soon. ""It just shows that we need to look at the impact this is having on the younger generation - those at school, college, university and those who are about to graduate. ""They are going to be the generation that is really going to feel the effects of this for some time."" The Scottish government said aerosol procedures were common in dentistry placements but unusual in other clinical settings such as medicine, nursing and midwifery. Students on those courses will not be required to repeat a year and any extensions to their programmes will be covered by other arrangements.

Dentists 'may have to close' without more support,"Some dental practices could close as a result of the pandemic, the British Dental Association (BDA) Scotland and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) has warned. The number of patients dentists can treat has been cut by rules to stop the virus from spreading. The RCSEd has warned that for NHS work the government was ""providing very little towards treatment"". But the Scottish government said the sector has had ""unprecedented support"". My NHS dentist can fix my son's teeth - if we go private NHS dentists' fears of struggle to meet demand Prof Philip Taylor, of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at RCSEd, said that for NHS work the government was ""providing very little towards treatment"". Fees are complex and can vary with each patient, but a dentist who fits a new metal crown for a back tooth on the NHS may receive a fee set by government of Â£80 to Â£100 - with the patient paying most of that. However, if the work was done privately, the RCSEd said the dentist could charge Â£300 to Â£400. Dentists whose businesses rely on NHS patients have warned that they are struggling to stay afloat with so few patients coming through the door. Under strict Covid protocols, treatment rooms must be thoroughly cleaned between patients and need to be left empty for a period of time after some procedures. This has cut the number of patients dentists can see, and those who rely on slim margins from NHS patients have warned that they may close their practices. Prof Taylor warned that practices closing down would create an access problem for patients. Many of those that closed were likely to be the ones most dependant on NHS fees - often in poorer parts of big cities - he added. One dentist told BBC Scotland the number of patients his practice could see in a day had been cut from 100 to 20. Fewer patients, he said, meant less income. ""I think we are in a dental health crisis,"" said David McColl, of BDA Scotland. ""You might see more practices saying we can't afford to run a service like this with NHS funding and turn private. ""Then you'd have a two-tier system where if you can afford it you can get the treatment, if you can't, you won't."" He added: ""We want to get back to treating our patients and have a fair system that is not target-driven. ""None of us wants this two-tier system - we need universal access for all"". But the Scottish government has said it is committed to ensuring all NHS patients who want to access NHS dental services continue to receive treatment. Scotland's chief dental officer, Tom Ferris, said that from 1 November all NHS treatments had been allowed again. He said: ""If an NHS patient has been offered or provided with private dental treatment then their dentist must be able to confirm that all available and appropriate NHS alternative treatments have been discussed with the patient and informed consent obtained."" Mr Ferris added that where a dentist had decided to reduce or altogether withdraw their NHS dental service, then suitable alternative arrangements would be put in place for patients. On the funding the government had made available to dentists during the pandemic, he said: ""The government is continuing to provide an unprecedented amount of financial support to ensure the continuity of NHS dental services."" He said payments worth up to Â£12m per month were being made to support the incomes of NHS dental practices. ""As well as deploying the Scottish government budget for NHS dental services, we are investing an additional Â£2.75m per month."" He added that dentists had been receiving a guaranteed income of 80% of gross fees during the pandemic, which had been increased to 85% from 1 November. PPE for dentists providing NHS care has also been provided through public money, where they previously provided this themselves. Mr Ferris added that in December a 2.8% pay rise for dentists would be backdated to April. ''We are working to ensure NHS dental services emerge from this crisis well placed to care for the oral health of the population and will continue to work collaboratively with the dental sector in developing a new model of care,"" he added.

"Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal FamilyThe Queen confirms the couple will not carry out ""duties that come with a life of public service"".UK","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

Uber drivers are workers not self-employedThe decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are set to receive minimum wage and holiday pay.Business,"Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning Â£30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than Â£1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability.

He thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications,externalfor a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers. ""The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing. ""This is even more important in the context of the pandemic."" As for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016. ""Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,"" she said. Dr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees. He told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these ""rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals"". This means that ""in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]"".

'Continual worry' of foot-and-mouth disease risk,"This video can not be played Looking back at the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak The risk posed by foot-and-mouth disease is a ""continual worry"" for Wales' most senior vet, two decades on from the last major outbreak. Christianne Glossop said 2001 was a year of terrible memories she will ""never forget"". Across Wales a million animals were slaughtered, with farming and tourism thrown into crisis. There are now ""solid contingency plans"" to minimise the chances of such widespread infection, she explained. Appointed chief veterinary officer for Wales in 2005 when powers over animal health and welfare were devolved, at the time of the epidemic Prof Glossop was working in private practice. The first case was detected at an abattoir in Essex on 19 February 2001. The animal disease that stopped the UK in its tracks In depth: The 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak,external ""Everybody involved in agriculture would remember exactly where they were and what they were doing on that dreaded day,"" she said. Within a week, the virus had reached Anglesey. Powys and Monmouthshire were also to become among the worst-hit counties. Christianne Glossop recalls how farmers cried in her arms when she told them their pigs were infected Distressing scenes of billowing smoke from burning pyres and carcasses being buried in vast pits filled TV news bulletins in a year consumed by efforts to get the outbreak under control - at an estimated cost of Â£8bn to the UK. Footpaths were closed, tourism nosedived, major events such as the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show and the Urdd Eisteddfod were cancelled and a general election delayed. Highly infectious, foot-and-mouth disease causes fever and painful blisters inside the mouth and under the hooves - and can be fatal for young animals. For Wales' farmers the fact the 20th anniversary of the crisis coincides with current lockdown restrictions has brought often traumatic memories to the surface. This video can not be played Foot-and-mouth disease caused widespread disruption throughout the UK in 2001. ""What was very sad and emotional was watching the animals being slaughtered on the farms and then being burnt and the smoke afterwards. It was something that sent a shiver down your back really,"" said Gareth Davies, who runs an upland farm in Cwmgwilym, north of Brecon in Powys. His sheep and cattle were shot after signs of infection were found on a neighbouring farm. ""One day you've got a farm full of livestock and the next day it's empty, like a graveyard,"" he said. Twenty years ago livestock across the UK were being burned ""It's a real shock - because we live with these animals, they're part of us - we have a respect and a loyalty and an affection for them. ""It's no different to the average person in the street with their pet dogs - it's the same emotional feeling you have."" Sheep were being tested in the Brecon Beacons in 2001 in an effort to control the spread Prof Glossop recalled visiting a pig farm and having to break the news it had been hit by foot-and-mouth to the farmer and his two grown-up sons. ""We stood in the farmyard and these men, they cried in my arms. It's not something you can ever forget."" Lessons learned from that time mean Wales and the UK are better placed to respond in future, she believes, pointing to a smaller outbreak in 2007 in Surrey that was quickly contained. Farm losses 'horrendous' due to bovine TB Welsh farmers given Bluetongue warning Chlorinated chicken concern grows among farmers ""A lot of things have changed since 2001. I do believe the plans we have in place are much tighter now, they're more robust and we know what to do."" Systems for registering and tracing livestock have improved, particularly for sheep and pigs, so the authorities know where they are. A six-day standstill rule limits movement of animals on and off farms to allow time to spot signs of disease and prevent its spread. A UK-wide movement ban would also be introduced immediately in the event of a new outbreak - unlike in 2001 when a delay of several days was blamed for making the situation worse. Anglesey was the first place in Wales to have a positive test in 2001 Prof Glossop believes the devolution of animal health and welfare powers is another step forward, meaning Wales can tailor its own plans to the nature of the farming industry in the country. ""We have a close working relationship with our farmers and our vets - we can call people together and share messages quickly and widely. I sleep with my phone by my bed and any time of day or night somebody out there could be seeing signs of a notifiable disease."" Joint exercises are also carried out across the four UK nations - the last, codenamed Blackthorn, taking place in 2018. Stephen James, chair of the Welsh Government's animal health and welfare framework group, said it was ""so important everyone sticks to the rules"". ""This applies if you keep hundreds of animals or even just a single pig behind your house - you mustn't keep it under the radar."" John Mercer says a risk remains from illegally imported meat Strict border controls are also vital, according to John Mercer, who worked for the state veterinary service at the time of the epidemic and is now director of the NFU Cymru farming union. It is thought one way the virus could have reached the UK in 2001 was through illegally imported meat, leading to a ban on feeding animals with any catering waste or kitchen scraps. ""We have excellent protocols in place to stop anything coming in via the legal trade but there's always a risk when it comes to the illegal trade as we know foot-and-mouth is endemic in some parts of the world,"" Mr Mercer explained. The events of 2001 had ""really pushed people to the edge"", he said. ""Let's hope we never see that again."" Wales' final case was identified in Crickhowell, Powys on 12 August 2001, with the country declared free of foot-and-mouth disease in December that year. Slowly the countryside returned to normality, which Prof Glossop describes as a ""healing in people's hearts and a healing in the land"".

UN asks for 'proof' that Princess Latifa is alive,"This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" The United Nations human rights office has asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, is alive. In secretly recorded videos shared with the BBC, Princess Latifa accused her father of holding her hostage in Dubai since she tried to flee in 2018. The UN has contacted David Haigh from the Free Latifa campaign requesting access to the footage. In the videos, Princess Latifa says she fears for her life. The footage, released by friends and aired by BBC Panorama earlier this week, prompted global calls for a UN investigation. ""We raised our concerns about the situation in light of the disturbing video evidence that emerged this week,"" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Friday.

"Max the Miracle Dog gets 'animal OBE' honourThe 13-year-old therapy dog brings peace and joy to many, according to owner Kerry Irving.","This video can not be played Meet Max the Miracle Dog, the first pet getting the ""animal OBE"" A therapy dog who has found fame online is being given a top honour by vet charity PDSA. Videos of Max the Miracle Dog's daily walks in the Lake District are watched by thousands of people. The 13-year-old springer spaniel will bethe first pet to receive the PDSA Order of Merit,external, with previous recipients including police and search and rescue animals. The dog's owner Kerry Irving saidMax saved his life and helps many others. Locksmith Kerry Irving shares daily videos of Max's walks on Facebook The PDSA, which nicknamed the honour the ""animal OBE"", said the ""positive and life-altering impact Max has on the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide is unprecedented"". A spokesman said Max's popularity on social media ""provides a feel-good factor"", and since 2017 the dog has also met more than 10,000 people and raised almost Â£300,000 for a number of charities. Going for a walk with Max the Miracle Dog Mr Irving, who lives in Keswick, met Max while he was suffering depression two years after being seriously injured in a car crash which left him with chronic pain. He said Max gave him the motivation to get out and walk, and he later adopted the dog after Max's owners decided to move to a city. After taking on Max, Kerry Irving went on to get two more spaniels called Paddy and Harry Mr Irving said: ""When I was at my lowest, Max became my reason to live and he continues to make me smile every day. Being able to share the support, comfort and joy that Max brings to thousands of people has been a privilege. ""We receive daily messages from people all over the world, saying how Max's adventures make them smile and bring joy to their life. Each has their own personal story. I have met soldiers who served in Afghanistan who say they used to look at Max's page to remind them of home. I've also received messages from NHS staff working on the frontline during the pandemic, who have found moments of peace and escape with Max."" Max has met more than 10,000 people including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said Max had become a ""true ambassador for the positive impact that animals have on mental health and wellbeing, which is more important now than ever"". The PDSA Order of Merit was created in 2014 and since then 32 dogs and horses have been recognised for their work.

"Ted Cruz flew to Mexico as Texans froze in stormsThe Republican defends his family's Cancun trip during the crisis, saying he wanted ""to be a good dad"".","Senator Ted Cruz takes questions at the Cancun airport on 18 February Texas Senator Ted Cruz has attempted to defend taking a family trip to Mexico amid a winter storm that left millions in his state without power and water. Mr Cruz said on Thursday he planned the holiday for his daughters, ""wanting to be a good dad"", but had returned because it ""didn't feel right"". Photos of the Republican lawmaker at an airport on Wednesday fuelled outrage at how he had left Texas during a crisis. Millions of people in Texas face water shortages, with reservoirs near empty. Freezing temperatures have caused power blackouts at water treatment facilities and burst water pipes supplying homes, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets. About 13 million Texans have been told to boil water that may be contaminated. Texas residents told to boil water in winter storm Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now The moment the crowd turned on Ted Cruz Mr Cruz, a high-profile Republican who ran for the US presidency in 2016, has not only drawn criticism for taking the international trip, but also for reportedly leaving his dog, Snowflake, behind. A New York Magazine reporter tweeted an image early on Thursday that appeared to show the senator's home, with Snowflake visible through the glass of the front door. Allow Twitter content?

The canine was reportedly being cared for by a security guard. In a written statement released on Thursday afternoon, Mr Cruz said that with schools closed in the state, he had booked the vacation for his young daughters who ""asked to take a trip with friends"". The senator said he and his staff were ""in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas"". Mr Cruz did not apologise for making the trip amid the state of emergency in Texas, butin a later interview with broadcaster ABC13, he said it was ""a mistake"",external. ""In hindsight, if I had understood how it would be perceived, the reaction people would have, obviously I wouldn't have done it,"" he said, adding that he had had ""second thoughts as soon as we left"" and understood why people were ""upset"". ""Leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn't feel right, and so I changed my return flight and flew back on the first available flight I could take,"" he said. Mr Cruz returned to Texas on Thursday The Republican has now returned to Houston. As a federal lawmaker, Mr Cruz does not have a direct role in Texas' emergency response, but residents often reach out to their elected officials - like Mr Cruz - during natural disasters for help accessing resources. The senator's travel plans amid the crisis in Texas drew immediate criticism online. ""People in Texas are literally freezing to death and yet Ted Cruz went on vacation to Cancun,"" wrote Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal on Twitter. ""Ted Cruz not only fled the state while millions of vulnerable Texans are without heat and water but specifically diverted police resources to get him through security and crowds faster for his outgoing vacation flight,"" wrote progressive rights activist Charlotte Clymer on Twitter.

Some criticised Mr Cruz for appearing to use his daughters to deflect blame. Journalist Leah Binkovitz appeared to mock the senator, writing on Twitter: ""I relate to Ted Cruz because my kids have also asked tough questions of me lately like, 'what happens if we run out of food and water'."" The chairman of the Republican Party in Texas, Allen West, said Mr Cruz ""has to answer to his constituents"" for the decisions he has made during the current winter weather crisis. But some conservatives came to Mr Cruz's defence - author and activist Brigitte Gabriel wrote: ""Senator Ted Cruz is one of the hardest working men in the country, he deserves a vacation."" Mr Cruz's trip to Mexico also raised concerns among other parents whose children attend the same private school in Houston as his daughters. The school's policy states thatstudents who travel abroad cannot return to classrooms for seven days,externalafter returning home, the New York Times reported. It adds that students must take a coronavirus test within three to five days of returning, which must then produce a negative result before they can return to classrooms. Others suggested the added scrutiny may hurt Mr Cruz as he reportedly contemplates a second presidential bid in 2024. The lawmaker's current Senate term will expire in early 2025. At least 47 storm-related deaths have been reported and hospitals have been placed under severe pressure. Food supplies in supermarkets are running low and residents are struggling to keep warm in some of the coldest temperatures the state has seen in more than 30 years - hitting 0F (-18C) earlier this week. Texas family 'trying to keep warm' Texas has opted out of the national power grids, and so has been particularly hard hit by the exceptional conditions. Outages are expected to continue for days. This video can not be played 'Heâs 92 so we wrapped him tight like a mummy' Governor Greg Abbott has asked residents to shut off water to their home if possible to help keep pressure up amid concerns over the disruption in supply to hospitals. Mr Cruz had been active on Twitter in recent days, sharing updates about power in the state. In his Thursday statement, Mr Cruz said that his family had also lost heat and power, just like other Texans. ""The greatest state in the greatest country in the world has been without power,"" he said.

Treasury eyes VAT charges for gig economy firms,"The Treasury is looking at ways of taxing services provided by gig economy firms such as Uber, Airbnb and TaskRabbit. It is concerned that tax rules are not up-to-date enough to cover these type of tech platforms. The gig economy has grown rapidly and is expected to be worth Â£140bn by 2025. Not charging VAT means the the Treasury loses out on revenue, at a time when it is facing a huge hole in public finances due to the coronavirus crisis. However, its concerns about the ""sharing economy"" predate the start of the pandemic. Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits Tech Tent: The end of the gig economy? Airbnb plans public share sale despite pandemic On the Record: Stacy Brown-Philpot, TaskRabbit On Thursday, theTreasury published a consultation paper called VAT and the Sharing Economy,externalto call for feedback on the issue. When self-employed contractors carry out the service booked on a platform such as Uber, Airbnb or Task Rabbit, they often individually fall below the Â£85,000 VAT registration threshold. But if they were employees and the service was provided by the platform company, consumers would have to pay the tax. The review is part of the government's aim of ""ensuring fair competition and a level playing field for all businesses, whether operating in the sharing economy or as a traditional business, regardless of their size and location"". Based on the predicted size of the gig economy by 2025, it would equate to a loss of up to Â£28bn a year in VAT for the Treasury. The consultation document highlighted examples of the business practices it wanted to investigate for action where ""no VAT [was] being charged where it might have been in the traditional economy"". These included car-booking rides where ""the drivers at this firm are all self-employed"". The Treasury added that the review was designed to ""test the government's view of the VAT challenges the sharing economy creates"". Last month's spending review by the Office for Budget Responsibility revealed there was a Â£40bn a year hole in the public finances. Another issue is defining what is consider part of the sharing economy as definitions differ. The Treasury says it should cover ""any digital platform which facilitates the supply of services between two or more unconnected parties."" This would include labour for household repairs, renting out an apartment and a driver offering passenger transport using their personal car.

The man who taught Uber how to say sorry,"When the Uber he'd hired went to the wrong destination, one professor took his complaint to the very top - and then learned something valuable about the science of apologising. In January 2017, John List was due to give a keynote speech at a prestigious gathering of economists. He picked up his phone and, using the Uber app, booked a cab to take him the 30-minute journey from his home. He looked up briefly, as the car sped along Lake Shore Drive, on the banks of Lake Michigan, and took in the view of the approaching city, with its fabulous skyline of skyscrapers. Then he settled back down to work on his talk. About 20 minutes later he looked up again. Surely he must be nearly there now? ""Oh no!!"" he screamed. He was back where he'd begun. Something had gone wrong with the Uber app, which had instructed the driver to return to the professor's home. She had not wanted to disturb him, as he was so engrossed in his work. List was understandably furious. But what made him more so, was that Uber never sent him an apology. Not everyone who has a complaint to make with Uber has access to its chief executive, but John List did, and so he rang Travis Kalanick that evening. (This was not long before Kalanick was forced to step down as a result of shareholder pressure, following a series of controversies over company practices including its handling of sexual harassment allegations.) After List had related the tale, and let off a bit of steam, Kalanick spoke. ""What I want to know,"" he said, ""is how Uber should apologise when this sort of cock-up occurs.  What's the best way to keep Uber customers loyal, even when they've had a miserable experience?"" How to apologise is a question which every company is interested to know the answer. And John List was in a unique position to find out. Not many people with John List's background become leading academics. He grew up in a working class family in Sun Prairie, north-east of the Wisconsin capital Madison. His Dad was a lorry driver and expected his son to enter the family business. John had other ideas. His dream was to become a professional golfer and he won a golf scholarship to college. There he discovered two things: first, he wasn't as good at golf as he had once thought, and second, he was fascinated by economics. He's now on the economics faculty at one of America's top universities, the University of Chicago. But for a few years he's also been moonlighting, because Uber approached him to be their chief economist, and after he moved on from Uber, he joined another car-riding app, Lyft, where he holds the same position. Travis Kalanick had to make a series of apologies himself, before resigning in 2017 No doubt the job is generously remunerated, but for John List it has another appeal; for data geeks, car apps are like gold mines - in the US alone, before the pandemic, there were two million Uber drivers, making tens of millions of trips each week. John List has spent his career studying economic behaviour in the real world, so working with Uber ""was a dream come true"". With this cornucopia of information, he could analyse all sorts of consumer preferences: what kinds of cars people like, how far they typically travelled, and at what times, how they responded to a change in the price of fares. He could also learn the best way to apologise. His first step was to look at what happened to Uber users after they had had a bad ride - one that had taken much longer than the app had initially predicted. The app might predict, for example, that a journey would take nine minutes, and it would end up taking 23 minutes. By crunching the numbers, he and his collaborators discovered that riders who'd experienced such a bad ride would spend up to 10% less on Uber in the future. That represented a significant loss of earnings for the car app. The next move was to come up with a variety of apologies, and to randomly try them out on those who'd experienced a bad trip. Listen to John List inUbernomics,an episode of The Big Idea, on the BBC World Service Click here for transmission times, or to listen online Download the podcast It turns out there's a sort of science of sorry. Social scientists - and psychologists in particular - have studied what kinds of apologies work. But John List had a big advantage; he could actually measure the impact. He calls one type of sorry, the ""basic apology"" - ""We note that your trip took longer than we predicted and we sincerely apologise."" A more sophisticated apology involves an admission that the company messed up. Another type of apology involves a commitment - ""We will try to ensure that this will not happen again."" On Uber's behalf, John List tried them all. What's more, with some of these apologies Uber offered a $5 discount off the next trip. In the experiment there was also a group of Uber customers who received no apology at all. How many people does it take to oust a political leader? Choice blindness: Do you know yourself as well as you think? The result was surprising. On their own, apologies in whatever form proved ineffective. But an apology coupled with the $5 coupon kept many people loyal. ""So, we end up bringing back millions of dollars by assuaging consumers with an apology and a coupon."" What consumers want, it turns out, is for a company to demonstrate its remorse by taking a material financial hit. But looking deeper into the stats, List realised that even this device ceased to work if there was a second or third bad trip. Indeed, a second or third apology only seemed to alienate customers further. These are invaluable insights for Uber, and for other businesses too. Many economists sit at their desks and make predictions about economic activity based on their models. What makes John List a little unusual for an economist is that he likes to test theories out in the real world. He's conducted experiments from Tanzania, to New Zealand, China to Bangladesh. The vast digital data sets held by Uber and other car apps have enabled him to identify certain quirks in human behaviour that armchair economists might not have uncovered. For example, when you book an Uber you never know whether you'll get a male or female driver, so you might expect male and female drivers to earn the same. But in fact, male drivers earn about 7% more per hour than their female counterparts. Shocked by this disparity, List set about trying to find out the reason for it. He uncovered several explanations. One is that women tend to have more childcare responsibilities, so there are fewer female drivers available at lucrative times, such as morning and afternoon rush hour. But by far the most important factor turns out to be speed: Uber-driving men drive on average about 2.5% faster than Uber-driving women, so they give more rides per hour. Male drivers get smaller tips (even when they're awake) That's not the only gender gap. Because he thought it would make Uber drivers happier, List persuaded the Uber board to add a tipping function - bringing Uber in line with other car apps. He then studied tipping behaviour. For every $4 women give as a tip, it transpired, men give around $5. What's more, women drivers receive more tips than male drivers - except when those women drivers are 65 years old or older. I think we can take this as further evidence of male shallowness. The study of economic behaviour through car app data has been called Ubernomics - though John List's box of data toys is now delivered to him by Lyft, not Uber - and he continues to produce a stream of fascinating results. Analysing the behaviour of Lyft users, he's recently computed the power of what he calls ""left-digit bias"". Cutting the price of a journey from $15 to $14.99 has roughly the same impact on consumer demand as reducing it from $15.99 to $15. Some of the discoveries in Ubernomics are unsurprising. Consumers care about price: the lower the cost, the more likely we are to book a cab. But the analysis of how we use car apps is also revealing some of the biases and idiosyncrasies of human economic behaviour. By the way, if you ever decide to become an Uber driver, and think that being nice to the customer will have a significant impact on your income, there is some bad news. I'm afraid it won't. Even when customers rate one driver 10% higher than another for niceness, John List says, they both receive the same tip. We are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing? Can we teach robots ethics?

UK to launch 'high risk' science agency,"The UK is to launch a ""high-risk"" science agency to look for ground-breaking discoveries. The agency, Aria, will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS. Aria, which has Â£800m funding over four years, will have a ""higher tolerance for failure than is normal"", the government said. Labour said the government needed to clarify what the agency would do. The new body - the Advanced Research & Invention Agency (Aria) - would fund ""high-risk, high-reward"" scientific research, the government said. But the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). For 2020-21 alone, the governmenthas allocated Â£10.36bn,externalfor its research programmes and bodies. Nevertheless, the government said that Aria would ""help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower"". Smart materials: From tiny robots to colour-swapping clothes AI used to 'predict the next coronavirus' Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the new agency would ""drive forward the technologies of tomorrow"" by ""stripping back unnecessary red tape"". ""From the steam engine to the latest artificial intelligence technologies, the UK is steeped in scientific discovery. Today's set of challenges - whether disease outbreaks or climate change - need bold, ambitious and innovative solutions. ""Led independently by our most exceptional scientists, this new agency will focus on identifying and funding the most cutting-edge research and technology at speed,"" Mr Kwarteng said. Boris Johnson's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings wasa prominent supporter of ""blue-sky"" thinking by small groups of scientists,external, saying in 2019 funding should be given to ""high-risk high-payoff visions"". It was the sale of the UK's artificial intelligence startup DeepMind to Google in 2014 which apparently got Dominic Cummings thinking. The man who was to become Boris Johnson's chief advisor became obsessed with the idea that the UK was giving away its technological crown jewels. The answer, he decided, was to create a British version of Arpa, the American agency credited with funding the development of the internet and GPS. Despite Mr Cummings' departure from Downing Street, the government has opted to go ahead with Aria, an agency designed to make big bets on risky projects. It will have a tiny fraction of the budget of the existing research agency UKRI, which will carry on doing its job. But Aria will apparently be independent, freed from bureaucracy and imbued with a Silicon Valley culture where failure is not to be feared. The test, of course, will be whether there are also successes to celebrate. Aria will be modelled on the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), which supported research that led to the internet and GPS, and its successor Darpa, which funded the precursors to today's coronavirus vaccines. Science and innovation minister Amanda Solloway said: ""To rise to the challenges of the 21st Century, we need to equip our R&D community with a new scientific engine - one that embraces the idea that truly great successes come from taking great leaps into the unknown."" Recruitment for a chief executive and chair for the agency will begin in the coming weeks. Matthew Fell, CBI UK chief policy director, said the UK had ""a unique opportunity to play to its strength"" with the new agency, to help create jobs, raise productivity and tackle the biggest challenges facing the country. ""Key to Aria's success will be strong business engagement to make sure the brilliant ideas developed can make it through to market,"" he added. Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: ""Engineering is central to an ambitious innovation agency of this kind, forming the bridge between research and innovation to enable technological and commercial breakthroughs."" But Labour shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the agency needed to have a clear mandate and to be subject to Freedom of Information laws, to ensure transparency of funding. ""Labour has long called for investment in high ambition, high risk science,"" he said. ""But government must urgently clarify the mission and mandate of this new organisation, following strong engagement with the UK's science base - those closest to the work.""

Breaking|Breaking newsHarry and Meghan not returning to Royal FamilyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex tell the Queen they will not return as working royals.UK,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

"Breaking|Breaking newsHarry and Meghan not returning to Royal FamilyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex tell the Queen they will not return as working royals.UKWales' stay-at-home rules may end in MarchMark Drakeford says he hopes this will be the last three weeks' of the ""stay-at-home"" restrictions.Wales politics","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

"Wales' stay-at-home rules may end in MarchMark Drakeford says he hopes this will be the last three weeks' of the ""stay-at-home"" restrictions.Wales politics","This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"".

Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Weâll be back
with more coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Todayâs live page was brought to
you by Ella Wills, Georgina Rannard, James Clarke, Jo Couzens, Katie Wright and
Victoria Lindrea. Weâll be ending our live coverage shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Northern Ireland Assembly members will be able totake part remotely in assembly proceedings for the first time from Monday, according to a letter from the Speaker Alex Maskey sent today. Maskey asked assembly members (MLAs) to be patient as there could be ""teething problems"" in adapting to the new system. He also said MLAs should ensure they participate remotely from a location with ""good connectivity"". Some assembly members had called for remote proceedings, due to the pandemic. Avirtual system was set up at Westminsterlast year. Photos posted on Facebook allegedly showed Aftab Razaq attending the ceremony A Manchester councillor accused of breaching Covid restrictions by flying to Pakistan and attending a wedding has been suspended by the local Labour Party. Photos were shared on Facebook last weekend allegedly showingManchester City Councillor Aftab Razaqat the celebration in the city of Kharian. Under the current Covid-19 rules in the UK, it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfor holidays and other leisure purposes. Mr Razaq, 52, has yet to respond to the BBC's request for a comment. He was seen in the photos apparently ignoring social distancing and not wearing a mask, despite virus rules in Pakistan making this mandatory. It was initially believed that the virus originated at a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan In his interview with the BBC, the US Secretary of State has also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. Anthony Blinkenaccused China of failing to share informationthat might shed light on the origins of Covid-19. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. Blinken said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. This video can not be played US is 'determined to engage in the world' - Blinken ""America is back"" and fully engaged in helping resolve global issues including the pandemic,US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tells the BBC. In his first international interview, Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19, marking a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Blinken said. The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. With thousands of schools still closed around the world, there are increasingly urgent warnings of the impact of the pandemic on millions of children. In the video below, Ros Atkins looks at risks of re-opening and of not doing so. This video can not be played Ros Atkins onâ¦ COVID-19 and the schools crisis It would be ""reckless"" to bring back all pupils in England to school together on 8 March, saysa joint statement by teachers' unions. Rather than risk another ""spike"" in infections, they are calling for a more ""cautious"" and ""phased"" return. Nine teachers and head teachers' unions have urged the government to commit to that date only if the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe. The prime minister is due to announce the plan for reopening schools on Monday. The collective statement from education unions says they are committed to bringing children back into the classroom as soon as possible - but have concerns it may lead to another surge in the virus. They say they are ""increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March"" - the government's target for opening schools. Here's a reminder of a few changes to lockdown restrictions in Wales announced in a press conference earlier by First Minister Mark Drakeford: Here's all you need to know about how Wales' rules are being loosened. The UK government'spledge to donate most of any surplus vaccine supply to poorer countrieshas been welcomed by Jose Manuel Barroso, chairman of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. He told BBC World News he was hopeful the virtual meeting of the G7 group of major economies would aid the process further. This video can not be played Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A single dose of the Pfizer
vaccine prevented 85% of symptomatic Covid infections in healthcare workers at
one of Israel's largest hospitals. And, compared with a group of
people who hadnât had the vaccine yet, there were 75% fewer infections overall
â  including those that didn't cause any symptoms. The analysis was based on more
than 9,000 staff members, 15-28 days after their first dose. The authors said it provided
""support"" to delaying the second dose in countries facing vaccine
shortages. The UK opted to give more people
one dose of the vaccine, rather than a smaller group two doses three weeks
apart. The NHS still plans to offer
second doses within 12 weeks. The argument was that, in the
face of very high cases, this would save more lives and protect more people
from severe disease. Although a relatively small
piece of analysis, it appears to offer some vindication to this strategy. It suggests just one dose â once
you wait the roughly two weeks it takes for protection to kick in - gave a very
high level of protection against disease. And it gave significant protection
against even carrying the virus. The researchers looked at days
15-28 after one dose of the vaccine, since thatâs the period after immunity has
begun to develop but before a second dose has had time to take effect. In Israel, second doses are
being given around the 21-day mark and are expected to take effect after about
a week - less time than the first dose takes because the immune system has
already been primed. The country has more or less
unfettered access to all the vaccine it needs, since it has struck a deal with
manufacturer in exchange for handing over large amounts of data, allowing Pfizer
to monitor how well it is working in a whole population. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in the UK has fallen below 20,000 for the first time since December, with the latest figuresreporting 19,392 hospital cases,external. The last time the figures dropped below this threshold was 20 December, when there were 19,455 people in hospital with Covid. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport While Covid-19 vaccine passports are ""feasible"", we need to know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said. They also have thepotential to discriminateagainst the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons. This must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report. It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan, including having a way to accommodate ""changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants"". And a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws. It is also vital to be clear about what the passports would be used for - whether that's international travel or greater domestic freedoms - the report outlined. Some countries in the world have ordered enough coronavirus jabs to vaccinate their population many times over. The graphic below details which have over-ordered vaccines - and which don't have enough. Oxfam saysthe steps taken by the G7 in terms of co-ordinating a joint Covid responseare welcome but still remain ""insufficient when compared to the scale of the Covid-19 threat"". In a statement, Max Lawson, Oxfam Head of Inequality Policy, said: ""Making huge parts of Africa and Asia wait for unwanted, leftover vaccines
from rich countriesâ stocks is not just immoral, it is irresponsible. And the
lack of coordinated action from the G7 is inexcusable. ""The longer huge swathes
of the worldâs population are denied protection, the greater the threat that
virus mutations will threaten us all. âPoor countries should not be forced to wait for vaccines to trickle down to
them. Between them, G7 nations have secured enough vaccines for every one of
their citizens to be vaccinated three times over, while many poor countries are
yet to receive a single dose. âThe G7 urgently needs to get its priorities straight during this
unprecedented pandemic and stop putting the profits of big pharma ahead of a
peopleâs vaccine.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Ski slopes in Poland, such as this one in Szczyrk, reopened last Friday The South African variant of coronavirus has been detected in Poland as the health minister Adam Niedzielski confirmed a third wave has arrived in the country. The first case of the variant was discovered near the city of Suwalki in north-eastern Poland, Niedzielski says. About 10% of Covid-19 cases in Poland are now the UK variant. Niedzielski says there has been a very dynamic increase in new infections in the past two weeks. ""Looking at the results it must be said that the third wave of the pandemic is already in Poland,"" he tells a news conference. The seven-day average this week exceeded 6,500 cases, he says, 1,000 more than in previous weeks. He also says the number of patients requiring hospital treatment, which had been decreasing, has reversed in the past week. The trend reversal comes just a week after Poland allowed ski slopes to reopen, as well as hotels, cinemas and theatres reopening at half capacity. Officials have said restrictions would be reinstated if cases rise significantly. On Friday, Poland reported 8,777 new cases in the previous 24 hours and 241 virus-related deaths. The number of new daily cases this week has been the highest in more than a month. Poland has vaccinated 2.56 million people, equivalent to 6.8% of the population, including 865,884 people who has received both doses, or 2.3% of the population. The number of people living in poverty in Indonesia has grown by more than 10% since the pandemic began in 2020, statistics show Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell has urged the government to think again about cutting the aid budget, saying he was ""far from sure"" the House of Commons would back the move in the middle of the pandemic. The Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One: âA very large number of colleagues on all sides of the House of Commons think this is not the time to cut aid and development."" If the cut went ahead, Mr Mitchell said the UK ""would have to stop making a lot of the planned vaccinations, cut the number of girls going to school, the number of people getting access to clean water"". ""A cut like that would lead to hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths mainly amongst children,â he added. He pointed out that where all other G7 countries were increasing aid, the UK - which is currently hosting a G7 meeting, was the only country proposing a cut. ""Iâm sure that the government will want to think again about this and I think the House of Commons is likely to insist that the government does."" Boris Johnson hosted the virtual meeting of G7 leaders The leaders of the G7 nations have agreed to ""intensify co-operation"" in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Following a virtual meeting hosted by Boris Johnson, they pledged to work together and with the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate global vaccine development and deployment. In a joint statement, they said: ""We reaffirm our support for all pillars of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), its Covax facility, and affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" They announced increased financial commitments totalling US$7.5bn (Â£5.3bn). The statement continued: ""We invite all partners, including the G20 and international financial institutions, to join us in increasing support to ACT-A, including to increase developing countries' access to WHO-approved vaccines through the Covax facility. ""Covid-19 shows that the world needs stronger defences against future risks to global health security."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data put forward by Pfizer-BioNTech suggests their Covid
vaccine could be stored at slightly warmer temperatures for a certain period of time,
making it easier to store and transport. Currently, the vaccine needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures - between -80C and -60C - which has meant special containers are required to
move shipments around. It can then be kept in a fridge for five days before being used. Now the company says its vaccine remains stable when stored
at -25C to -15C - the temperature of pharmaceutical
freezers - for two weeks. This could take place instead of, or alongside, storage at the very low
temperatures, giving GPs, pharmacies and vaccination centres more
flexibility in how they manage their supplies. It may also make providing this vaccine to populations
across the world a little less daunting. One advantage of the Oxford-AZ vaccine has always been that
it can be stored at the same temperature as a household fridge. The data collected by Pfizer has been handed to the US
authorities and it would need to be run past other regulators in other
countries too before any rules around the vaccine's storage could be changed. As of Thursday, some 16,875,536 people in the UK had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, up by 452,454 doses on the previous day. And 589,591 had received a second dose, up by 15,867 on the previous day. Returning to the UK's other daily figures, the number of cases - 12,027 - is down by just over 20% on last Friday, and the number of deaths - 533 - is down by nearly 30%. The figures for Wednesday and Thursday this week were both close to the level seen on the previous week, but that hasnât kept going today, BBC News head of statistics Robert Cuffe says. The rolling seven day averages are also down - 20% and 28% respectively. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Wales' Covid lockdown review to be outlined,"From Saturday, the number of people who can exercise together will increase from two to four From 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen, in line with current rules for register offices Primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen then The Conservatives have called for a ""road map to recovery"" but Plaid Cymru say a ""stay local"" message is needed for as long as necessary James McCarthy and Ben Frampton That's it from the coronavirus live page for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the main points:  Gyms could still pose a risk of so-called âsuperspreader eventsâ where many people catch Covid at the same time, according to scientific advice provided to ministers. Mr Drakeford confirmed the current advice was that gyms should stay shut, particularly given the rise of new, more easily transmitted variants of the virus. âI certainly donât anticipate gyms re-opening, certainly not in the next three weeks,â he said. âBut evidence will accumulate over the weeks ahead, as we gradually allow more things to open, whether or not allowing people to get together, with the new Kent variant will allow the virus to come back at a very quick rate. âIf it doesnât, then the Technical Advisory Cell (of scientific advisers) will revisit its advice, and we will see whatâs able to be done.â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says he is worried about Covid variants, but the âdirection of travel is an incredibly positive one"". âThe one source of uncertainty, of course, is the effect of these new variants,"" he said. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today. âThe government's own advisors, as well as the TAC (Technical Advisory Cell) report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths. âSo we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales."" Teachers union the NASUWT has criticised the decision begin reopening schools. General secretary Dr Patrick Roach warned the âsituation on public health and in transmission of the virus remains incredibly fragile and precarious."" He said: âIn making the decision to proceed with the phased wider return to school for some pupils, the Welsh Government has not demonstrated that its decisions will not undermine the health and safety of school staff and pupils or undermine efforts to reduce levels of virus transmission in the community. ""Schools, teachers and parents need to have compelling evidence that this will not be the case. ""Unless that evidence is clear, an announcement now for a wider reopening of schools is premature."" However, Tory leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the move, but is concerned not enough is being done for businesses. âI welcome the news on education because we know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and studentsâ educational pathway,"" he said. âWhat I think is regrettable is that the first minister didnât open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work. âI think that's an opportunity thatâs been missed.â The first minister says heâs âkeen to learn the lessonsâ from
lifting lockdown restrictions after the first wave of Covid-19. Mark Drakeford says there were things that âworked well thenâ
but âwe can do things better.â His comments came after he was asked whether more
support should be made available for businesses forced to shut for lockdown. âI know that what businesses in Wales want is not more money
from the government - what they want is to be able to open and have a thriving
business in the way that they had this time last year. âI've indicated today that we will be talking with
non-essential retail and close personal services that are closed at the moment
to see if it's possible for anything to resume in three weeksâ time. âLast time we opened hairdressers first and then other
services of a similar sort - nail bars and so on - followed a couple of weeks
later."" But lifting lockdown will not be driven just by
figures, Mr Drakeford said. He told the coronavirus press
briefing that he will take ""a judgment in the round, informed by the
advice of our senior clinicians and scientific advisers"". He said the government would continue to look
at benchmarks such as ""the number of people (with coronavirus) per
100,000"" as well as positivity rates, the R number and the impact of coronavirus on hospitals. ""We will then look at all of that as a
package and take advice from those who are responsible for our health service,
and who model for us the way coronavirus is spreading in Wales. ""And when we
take all of that together, the cabinet will make a judgment on what is possible
in three weeks' time.""  The Welsh Retail Consortium has welcomed the ""glimmer of hope"" that shops will soon be able to reopen. Consortium chief Sara Jones said: ""Many retailers have been hit hardest in this third, and
hopefully final, lockdown and today we have a glimmer of hope that we will soon
be able to reopen our doors to the Welsh public once more. âSo-called non-essential shops are well placed to reopen
safely and should be trusted to do so, as they did so successfully at the end
of the national lockdown last June and again at the end of the firebreak."" ""Retailers
have been playing their part to make stores safe, spending many millions of
pounds on coronavirus safety measures, including implementing social distancing
measures and increased cleaning procedures. âItâs therefore
essential the Welsh Government maintains it commitment to prioritising
the re-opening of our high streets, whilst outlining an ongoing economic
stimulus package to encourage consumers to start shopping again and providing
an immediate statement on business rates relief post March."" Ministers want to avoid a âstop-startâ situation where pubs re-open and then have to close again, Mr Drakeford said. The first minister held talks with industry figures yesterday, but there is no date set yet for when pubs, bars and restaurants might be able to open their doors. He said hospitality venues were not likely to reopen for at least another six weeks. âOf course we listen to, and engage and talk with, the sector but I just have to explain to them, as I do to many other businesses who are of course desperately anxious to resume, that the only way we will succeed in getting them back trading is if we approach the reopening of our economy and our society in a way that is careful, that is step-by-step and allows us always to review the impact of any action we take on the circulation of the virus. âToo much too soon will simply return us to the very difficult days we sawâ¦ before Christmas. The other thing that the hospitality industry said to me yesterday is what they donât want is stop-start. âThey donât want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close.â Mr Drakeford said if circulation of the Covid
virus continued to decrease, that a ""modest resumption"" in the
tourism industry might be possible. He said he'd met tourism bosses yesterday
and told them ""they are not likely to see a reopening at either of
the next two, three-week review periods"". Infections are continuing to
fall in Wales, according to the most recent Office for National Statistics survey. It tookthroat and nose swab tests from
hundreds of households in Wales. From the results, it can
estimate that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 12 February, a
decrease on the previous survey a week ago. This is one in 125 people - down
from one in 85 people - or 0.81%, down from 1.16% of the population. The survey is seen as a useful
way of looking at the pandemic's progress because although numbers are limited,
it picks up people who are asymptomatic. When broken down into health
board areas, the household survey results led to infection estimates ranging
from one in 125 people in Aneurin Bevan to one in 185 in Swansea Bay. But these
are based on much smaller sample sizes. The modelling was based on swab
tests from 20,580 people over six weeks from 10,734 households. Mr Drakeford says the next review of restrictions will be in the week beginning 8 March and - once again - the priority will be on getting children back to school. He says he thinks he will continue to take âa careful and cautious approach - as we have throughout the pandemic - guided by what the experts tell usâ. âGetting more children and young people back to school and college will be our priority. âIf things remain on track, our aim is for all primary school children to return to face-to-face learning from 15 March. âWe also want to get some older learners - such as years 11 and 13 in schools and those doing qualifications in colleges - back on a blended learning basis."" Mr Drakeford says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 for the first time since early December and the number of people with coronavirus in intensive care is 50% lower than at the peak of the pandemic. He said âreally good progressâ was being made on the vaccination programme âthanks to the enormous efforts of everyone involved across Walesâ. ""The very latest figures show almost 840,000 people have had their first dose â this is equivalent of a third of the adult population of Wales.â ""This week we started offering people appointments for second doses and more than 25,000 people have had theirs already. ""Weâre on track to reach the next milestone of offering vaccination to everyone in priority groups five to nine by the end of April, provided vaccine supplies remain on course."" The First Minister says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 Weddings and civil partnerships are to be allowed from next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We will change the law to allow licenced
wedding venues, such as visitor attractions and hotels, to re-open but only to
perform wedding and civil partnership ceremonies. ""And, as
more people living and working (in) care homes are vaccinated, we will look again at
our guidance for visiting."" He hoped to see cases continue to fall in the coming weeks. As many as four people from two different homes will be able to exercise together from Saturday. Mark Drakeford says the Welsh Government is now able to make ""modest changes"" to lockdown regulations and taking ""some first cautious steps to relax some of the strictest lockdown restrictions we have all been living with for so long"". He said at a press conference: ""From
tomorrow, we will change the rules to allow up to four people from two
different households to exercise outdoors together, helping people who have
been struggling with lockdown. ""But this does
not mean you can now drive somewhere to exercise and it does not mean
socialising."" Most council meetings in one Welsh county could remain virtual, post Covid-19, in a bid tocut down on travel and improve diversity. Before the pandemic, Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon, resulting in a three-hour round trip for some. Now plans have been outlined to allow councillors to take part in debates from their homes for years to come. A report to councillors said virtual meetings had become the ""new normal"" and that continuing the virtual meetings would cut travel and reduce the council's carbon footprint and encourage more people to stand for election by making meetings more accessible,the Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. Before the pandemic Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon A further 16 people have died with coronavirus in Wales,according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths to 5,205. There have also been a further 533 cases reported, making Wales' overall case rate 84 for every 100,000 people. The total number of people who have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine is now 839,065. Second Covid jab doses have been given to 25,433 people. Wales' first minister says he hopes this will bethe last three weeks of the ""stay-at-home"" requirement. Mark Drakeford said any change depended on case rates falling and it was too soon to say if people would be able to travel beyond their local area. He also said he hoped primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March if Covid cases continued to fall. Talks will begin with non-essential shops about the prospects of reopening. Mr Drakeford said: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.""

Max the Miracle Dog gets 'animal OBE' honour,"This video can not be played Meet Max the Miracle Dog, the first pet getting the ""animal OBE"" A therapy dog who has found fame online is being given a top honour by vet charity PDSA. Videos of Max the Miracle Dog's daily walks in the Lake District are watched by thousands of people. The 13-year-old springer spaniel will bethe first pet to receive the PDSA Order of Merit,external, with previous recipients including police and search and rescue animals. The dog's owner Kerry Irving saidMax saved his life and helps many others. Locksmith Kerry Irving shares daily videos of Max's walks on Facebook The PDSA, which nicknamed the honour the ""animal OBE"", said the ""positive and life-altering impact Max has on the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide is unprecedented"". A spokesman said Max's popularity on social media ""provides a feel-good factor"", and since 2017 the dog has also met more than 10,000 people and raised almost Â£300,000 for a number of charities. Going for a walk with Max the Miracle Dog Mr Irving, who lives in Keswick, met Max while he was suffering depression two years after being seriously injured in a car crash which left him with chronic pain. He said Max gave him the motivation to get out and walk, and he later adopted the dog after Max's owners decided to move to a city. After taking on Max, Kerry Irving went on to get two more spaniels called Paddy and Harry Mr Irving said: ""When I was at my lowest, Max became my reason to live and he continues to make me smile every day. Being able to share the support, comfort and joy that Max brings to thousands of people has been a privilege. ""We receive daily messages from people all over the world, saying how Max's adventures make them smile and bring joy to their life. Each has their own personal story. I have met soldiers who served in Afghanistan who say they used to look at Max's page to remind them of home. I've also received messages from NHS staff working on the frontline during the pandemic, who have found moments of peace and escape with Max."" Max has met more than 10,000 people including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said Max had become a ""true ambassador for the positive impact that animals have on mental health and wellbeing, which is more important now than ever"". The PDSA Order of Merit was created in 2014 and since then 32 dogs and horses have been recognised for their work.

University watchdog faces 'impartiality' questions,"Lord Wharton's appointment has already faced accusations of ""cronyism"" England's new university regulator is facing questions about a potential conflict of interest. Lord Wharton has been appointed chair of the Office for Students (OfS) but is also a paid adviser to a firm Aquind, which wants to build a cable linking the UK and French electricity grids. The Â£1.2bn project would be built through the University of Portsmouth, which is strongly opposed to the route. The OfS says protections are in place to prevent conflicts of interest. ""Where there is a conflict related to an individual higher education provider we would expect the relevant board member to exclude themselves from any decisions directly related to that provider,"" said a spokesman for the OfS university watchdog. But the OfS declined to say whether that would specifically apply to the University of Portsmouth and its incoming chair, Conservative peer, Lord Wharton. The University of Portsmouth says any ""perceived conflict of interest"" needs to be ""transparently managed"". Aquind director Alexander Temerko has made financial donations to Conservative politicians The electricity cable ""interconnector"" plan has prompted much local protest in Portsmouth - with both Labour and Conservative MPs in the city opposing its digging through such a densely-populated area. The city council's planning officials said the prospect of it being pushed through with the compulsory acquisition of land was ""draconian"" and an ""interference with human rights"". The University of Portsmouth, whose land it would run through, is concerned about disruption to sporting facilities and says it would have a ""huge negative impact"" and leave it facing financial losses. Aquind firmly rejects the university's claims, saying the impact would be ""minimal"", work would be carried out in a way that reduced disruption and the route of the ""underground cable corridor has been amended and refined"" in response to earlier feedback. But the university will now face Lord Wharton both as someone working for Aquind, on the opposing side in this commercial dispute, and also the chair of the regulator, which has powers to impose fines and sanctions on universities such as itself. While there is no suggestion of impropriety in either role, as paid private adviser or incoming publicly-funded watchdog, there are questions being asked about an overlap. Boris Johnson and Alexander Temerko Portsmouth South MP, Stephen Morgan, questioned whether Lord Wharton could appear to be impartial. ""We know Aquind has links to Tory donors. But to be advising a firm responsible for this project while it is being challenged by a university Wharton is set to regulate, raises serious red flags about his impartiality, particularly if he keeps the Conservative whip. ""These revelations cast fresh doubt over Lord Wharton's suitability for this key role,"" said Mr Morgan, Labour's shadow minister for the armed forces. ""The potential conflicts of interest keep on mounting for Lord Wharton of Yarm,"" said Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union. Before the latest lockdown, there were protests in Portsmouth against the Aquind construction project The Department for Education says there is an ""extensive code of guidance"" to guard against a conflict of interest and that as chair, ""Lord Wharton would not be involved in individual regulatory decisions about universities"". It has also rejected accusationsmade by Labour about ""cronyism"", where his appointment had been linked to his political connections, saying the process was ""in line with the governance code on public appointments"". An Aquind spokesman says its adviser Lord Wharton had no part in ""determining the location of the underground cables or in the ongoing engagement with Portsmouth University"". His work for Aquind has been recorded in the House of Lords register of interests. The backers of the electricity scheme have also attracted attention. A director of Aquind is Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born businessman who has become a prominent financial donor to Conservative MPs. Mr Temerko's website shows the businessman with Lord Wharton at conferences and events It also shows him with senior politicians, including Education Secretary Gavin Williamson Mr Temerko's website has numerous pictures of himself with Aquind adviser Lord Wharton,externalat his side, at conferences, fundraisers and social events with other prominent Conservatives, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for whom Lord Wharton was a manager of his leadership campaign. The photos on Mr Temerko's website also show the businessman with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who appointed Lord Wharton to chair the Office for Students earlier this month. Lord Wharton's links with Mr Temerko go back before his role as Aquind's adviser. Records from the Electoral Commission show Mr Temerko made four donations to him, amounting to Â£25,000, between 2013 and 2016, when he was a Conservative MP. The Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, said Lord Wharton's work for Aquind's ""subsea electricity connector"" would be ""part-time, paid, strategic adviser to the company - acting as a sounding board for the company's ideas and future plans/ strategy of the business"". The University of Portsmouth is concerned about a ""huge negative impact"" from the cable going through its land This was in August 2017 when he had stopped being an MP and minister and was seeking their advice over taking up his new job with Aquind. The business secretary will make the decision later this year on whether the Aquind interconnector gets the go-ahead. The previous secretary of state, Alok Sharma, whose local constituency party had received a donation from Aquind of Â£10,000, had to recuse himself from any part in the decision-making process. Conservative MP David Morris, another recipient of a donation, had to apologise to the House of Commons for a breach of paid advocacy rules after asking a question in support of the Aquind cable project. Aquind says that all of its political donations have ""complied with the relevant legislations"". Local campaign groupsopposed to putting the Aquind cable through Portsmouthhave complained of the threat to the environment and the disruption caused by the construction. The university says it is not against the principle of the project, but its objections are about what it will mean in practice. ""The objections relate to the impact on the operation of the site and future development potential. The current plans will cause disruption to the provision of facilities to students and the local community, which together will impact the university's business,"" said a university spokesman. ""We are continuing our dialogue with Aquind to try to reach a resolution and find a route which does not have the huge negative impact on the university as is currently proposed. ""Lord Wharton's appointment does not change the basis of our objection and we have full confidence in him acting in his new position. We hope that any perceived conflict of interest on this matter will be able to be appropriately and transparently managed by all those involved."" But Aquind says it has already made changes to ""minimise any impact on open spaces"" and to respect environmental concerns. The energy firm says that the interconnector link would provide cheaper and greener electricity for consumers in the UK.

The previous secretary of state, Alok Sharma, whose local constituency party had received a donation from Aquind of Â£10,000, had to recuse himself from any part in the decision-making process. Conservative MP David Morris, another recipient of a donation, had to apologise to the House of Commons for a breach of paid advocacy rules after asking a question in support of the Aquind cable project. Aquind says that all of its political donations have ""complied with the relevant legislations"". Local campaign groupsopposed to putting the Aquind cable through Portsmouthhave complained of the threat to the environment and the disruption caused by the construction. The university says it is not against the principle of the project, but its objections are about what it will mean in practice. ""The objections relate to the impact on the operation of the site and future development potential. The current plans will cause disruption to the provision of facilities to students and the local community, which together will impact the university's business,"" said a university spokesman. ""We are continuing our dialogue with Aquind to try to reach a resolution and find a route which does not have the huge negative impact on the university as is currently proposed. ""Lord Wharton's appointment does not change the basis of our objection and we have full confidence in him acting in his new position. We hope that any perceived conflict of interest on this matter will be able to be appropriately and transparently managed by all those involved."" But Aquind says it has already made changes to ""minimise any impact on open spaces"" and to respect environmental concerns. The energy firm says that the interconnector link would provide cheaper and greener electricity for consumers in the UK. The Office for Students said its new chair Lord Wharton did not want to comment.

LiveLiveWales' Covid lockdown review to be outlined9 minutes ago9 minutes ago Good morningGood morningLive Wales' Covid lockdown review to be outlined  9 minutes ago,"From Saturday, the number of people who can exercise together will increase from two to four From 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen, in line with current rules for register offices Primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen then The Conservatives have called for a ""road map to recovery"" but Plaid Cymru say a ""stay local"" message is needed for as long as necessary James McCarthy and Ben Frampton That's it from the coronavirus live page for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the main points:  Gyms could still pose a risk of so-called âsuperspreader eventsâ where many people catch Covid at the same time, according to scientific advice provided to ministers. Mr Drakeford confirmed the current advice was that gyms should stay shut, particularly given the rise of new, more easily transmitted variants of the virus. âI certainly donât anticipate gyms re-opening, certainly not in the next three weeks,â he said. âBut evidence will accumulate over the weeks ahead, as we gradually allow more things to open, whether or not allowing people to get together, with the new Kent variant will allow the virus to come back at a very quick rate. âIf it doesnât, then the Technical Advisory Cell (of scientific advisers) will revisit its advice, and we will see whatâs able to be done.â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says he is worried about Covid variants, but the âdirection of travel is an incredibly positive one"". âThe one source of uncertainty, of course, is the effect of these new variants,"" he said. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today. âThe government's own advisors, as well as the TAC (Technical Advisory Cell) report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths. âSo we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales."" Teachers union the NASUWT has criticised the decision begin reopening schools. General secretary Dr Patrick Roach warned the âsituation on public health and in transmission of the virus remains incredibly fragile and precarious."" He said: âIn making the decision to proceed with the phased wider return to school for some pupils, the Welsh Government has not demonstrated that its decisions will not undermine the health and safety of school staff and pupils or undermine efforts to reduce levels of virus transmission in the community. ""Schools, teachers and parents need to have compelling evidence that this will not be the case. ""Unless that evidence is clear, an announcement now for a wider reopening of schools is premature."" However, Tory leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the move, but is concerned not enough is being done for businesses. âI welcome the news on education because we know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and studentsâ educational pathway,"" he said. âWhat I think is regrettable is that the first minister didnât open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work. âI think that's an opportunity thatâs been missed.â The first minister says heâs âkeen to learn the lessonsâ from
lifting lockdown restrictions after the first wave of Covid-19. Mark Drakeford says there were things that âworked well thenâ
but âwe can do things better.â His comments came after he was asked whether more
support should be made available for businesses forced to shut for lockdown. âI know that what businesses in Wales want is not more money
from the government - what they want is to be able to open and have a thriving
business in the way that they had this time last year. âI've indicated today that we will be talking with
non-essential retail and close personal services that are closed at the moment
to see if it's possible for anything to resume in three weeksâ time. âLast time we opened hairdressers first and then other
services of a similar sort - nail bars and so on - followed a couple of weeks
later."" But lifting lockdown will not be driven just by
figures, Mr Drakeford said. He told the coronavirus press
briefing that he will take ""a judgment in the round, informed by the
advice of our senior clinicians and scientific advisers"". He said the government would continue to look
at benchmarks such as ""the number of people (with coronavirus) per
100,000"" as well as positivity rates, the R number and the impact of coronavirus on hospitals. ""We will then look at all of that as a
package and take advice from those who are responsible for our health service,
and who model for us the way coronavirus is spreading in Wales. ""And when we
take all of that together, the cabinet will make a judgment on what is possible
in three weeks' time.""  The Welsh Retail Consortium has welcomed the ""glimmer of hope"" that shops will soon be able to reopen. Consortium chief Sara Jones said: ""Many retailers have been hit hardest in this third, and
hopefully final, lockdown and today we have a glimmer of hope that we will soon
be able to reopen our doors to the Welsh public once more. âSo-called non-essential shops are well placed to reopen
safely and should be trusted to do so, as they did so successfully at the end
of the national lockdown last June and again at the end of the firebreak."" ""Retailers
have been playing their part to make stores safe, spending many millions of
pounds on coronavirus safety measures, including implementing social distancing
measures and increased cleaning procedures. âItâs therefore
essential the Welsh Government maintains it commitment to prioritising
the re-opening of our high streets, whilst outlining an ongoing economic
stimulus package to encourage consumers to start shopping again and providing
an immediate statement on business rates relief post March."" Ministers want to avoid a âstop-startâ situation where pubs re-open and then have to close again, Mr Drakeford said. The first minister held talks with industry figures yesterday, but there is no date set yet for when pubs, bars and restaurants might be able to open their doors. He said hospitality venues were not likely to reopen for at least another six weeks. âOf course we listen to, and engage and talk with, the sector but I just have to explain to them, as I do to many other businesses who are of course desperately anxious to resume, that the only way we will succeed in getting them back trading is if we approach the reopening of our economy and our society in a way that is careful, that is step-by-step and allows us always to review the impact of any action we take on the circulation of the virus. âToo much too soon will simply return us to the very difficult days we sawâ¦ before Christmas. The other thing that the hospitality industry said to me yesterday is what they donât want is stop-start. âThey donât want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close.â Mr Drakeford said if circulation of the Covid
virus continued to decrease, that a ""modest resumption"" in the
tourism industry might be possible. He said he'd met tourism bosses yesterday
and told them ""they are not likely to see a reopening at either of
the next two, three-week review periods"". Infections are continuing to
fall in Wales, according to the most recent Office for National Statistics survey. It tookthroat and nose swab tests from
hundreds of households in Wales. From the results, it can
estimate that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 12 February, a
decrease on the previous survey a week ago. This is one in 125 people - down
from one in 85 people - or 0.81%, down from 1.16% of the population. The survey is seen as a useful
way of looking at the pandemic's progress because although numbers are limited,
it picks up people who are asymptomatic. When broken down into health
board areas, the household survey results led to infection estimates ranging
from one in 125 people in Aneurin Bevan to one in 185 in Swansea Bay. But these
are based on much smaller sample sizes. The modelling was based on swab
tests from 20,580 people over six weeks from 10,734 households. Mr Drakeford says the next review of restrictions will be in the week beginning 8 March and - once again - the priority will be on getting children back to school. He says he thinks he will continue to take âa careful and cautious approach - as we have throughout the pandemic - guided by what the experts tell usâ. âGetting more children and young people back to school and college will be our priority. âIf things remain on track, our aim is for all primary school children to return to face-to-face learning from 15 March. âWe also want to get some older learners - such as years 11 and 13 in schools and those doing qualifications in colleges - back on a blended learning basis."" Mr Drakeford says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 for the first time since early December and the number of people with coronavirus in intensive care is 50% lower than at the peak of the pandemic. He said âreally good progressâ was being made on the vaccination programme âthanks to the enormous efforts of everyone involved across Walesâ. ""The very latest figures show almost 840,000 people have had their first dose â this is equivalent of a third of the adult population of Wales.â ""This week we started offering people appointments for second doses and more than 25,000 people have had theirs already. ""Weâre on track to reach the next milestone of offering vaccination to everyone in priority groups five to nine by the end of April, provided vaccine supplies remain on course."" The First Minister says the total number of people in hospital with coronavirus has fallen below 1,800 Weddings and civil partnerships are to be allowed from next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We will change the law to allow licenced
wedding venues, such as visitor attractions and hotels, to re-open but only to
perform wedding and civil partnership ceremonies. ""And, as
more people living and working (in) care homes are vaccinated, we will look again at
our guidance for visiting."" He hoped to see cases continue to fall in the coming weeks. As many as four people from two different homes will be able to exercise together from Saturday. Mark Drakeford says the Welsh Government is now able to make ""modest changes"" to lockdown regulations and taking ""some first cautious steps to relax some of the strictest lockdown restrictions we have all been living with for so long"". He said at a press conference: ""From
tomorrow, we will change the rules to allow up to four people from two
different households to exercise outdoors together, helping people who have
been struggling with lockdown. ""But this does
not mean you can now drive somewhere to exercise and it does not mean
socialising."" Most council meetings in one Welsh county could remain virtual, post Covid-19, in a bid tocut down on travel and improve diversity. Before the pandemic, Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon, resulting in a three-hour round trip for some. Now plans have been outlined to allow councillors to take part in debates from their homes for years to come. A report to councillors said virtual meetings had become the ""new normal"" and that continuing the virtual meetings would cut travel and reduce the council's carbon footprint and encourage more people to stand for election by making meetings more accessible,the Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. Before the pandemic Gwynedd councillors had to travel to meetings in Caernarfon A further 16 people have died with coronavirus in Wales,according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths to 5,205. There have also been a further 533 cases reported, making Wales' overall case rate 84 for every 100,000 people. The total number of people who have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine is now 839,065. Second Covid jab doses have been given to 25,433 people. Wales' first minister says he hopes this will bethe last three weeks of the ""stay-at-home"" requirement. Mark Drakeford said any change depended on case rates falling and it was too soon to say if people would be able to travel beyond their local area. He also said he hoped primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March if Covid cases continued to fall. Talks will begin with non-essential shops about the prospects of reopening. Mr Drakeford said: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.""  Mark Drakeford said any change depended on case rates falling Hello and welcome to Walesâ live page, where weâll be bringing you the latest coronavirus news.

"Breaking|Breaking newsDental schools will not take new studentsUniversities Scotland says it is a ""sad, knock-on effect"" of dental students having to repeat a year.Scotland","Dental students have been unable to get face-to-face patient contact during the pandemic Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year. It was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic. Graduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year. Universities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year. A spokesman said: ""Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training. ""All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022. ""Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted."" Scotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year. The same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas. Savanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen. Her graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming. The reality, however, was still overwhelming. ""Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,"" she said. She conceded that the dental school being closed ""did have quite an impact"" on learning, as practical work was not possible. And there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. ""Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,"" she said. Ms Joyce said: ""I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended. ""We are all very accepting of the decisions,"" she added. The British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places. They said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come. David McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year. ""What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,"" he said. ""We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form. ""If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry."" At Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an ""inevitable and pragmatic decision"" to extend the training programme of existing dental students. He said: ""I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training."" Mr Swinney said he would be discussing the issues with the dental schools and the British Dental Association. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Woman shot during Myanmar anti-coup protests dies,"This video can not be played Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot during a demonstration, two days before her 20th birthday A young woman has become the first protester to die in the anti-coup demonstrations in Myanmar after she was shot in the head last week. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was injured two days before her 20th birthday when police tried to disperse protesters. Her wound was consistent with one from live ammunition, rights groups said. An image of the protester being cradled after she was shot was widely shared, and her death has triggered further anger against the authorities. Myanmar has seen days of protests following a military coup which overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. The police have denied using lethal force at the rally in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on 9 February, but doctors have said two other protesters were also struck by live rounds. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The shooting of a young protester The hospital in the city confirmed the protester's death at 11:00 local time (04:30 GMT). A funeral service will be held on Sunday, her family said. ""I want to encourage all the citizens to join the protests until we can get rid of this system,"" her sister, Mya Tha Toe Nwe, told reporters. ""That's all I want to say."" Authorities said they would investigate the case. The supermarket worker took part in the mass protest which saw police use water cannon against protesters who refused to retreat. Her brother had begged her not to join the demonstrations out of fear they could turn violent. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing travelled to the protest with her sisters from Yezin, a village north-east of the capital. Her brother warned her to stay at the back in case police started shooting. ""They wouldn't,"" she told him over the phone. A memorial was erected in the capital on Friday Video of the moment she was shot appeared to show her standing some distance from the police. She was placed on life support when she was taken to hospital and remained there until she died. ""We will look for justice and move forward,"" a doctor told AFP news agency, adding that staff had faced immense pressure since she was taken to their intensive care unit. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's family are all supporters of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). Her brother said she voted for the first time in last November's general election, which the NLD won by a landslide. ""We are heartbroken and cannot talk about it much now,"" he told AFP on Friday. ""It was such a waste. I feel terribly sorry as if [she was] my own family,"" one woman told the BBC in Yangon. ""I also want democracy. [Only then] will her sacrificed life not be wasted."" Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing is the first martyr for what has grown into a nationwide civil disobedience campaign in Myanmar. Her image has become one of the defining motifs of an already visually rich and imaginative protest movement - it has been copied in paint and hung, on huge posters, from overpasses in Yangon. The anger over her death is all the greater because it appeared so gratuitous; the police were not under serious pressure when they opened fire, and she was some distance from them, and appeared about to move back. High profile deaths have often been turning points for movements in other countries: the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, setting off protests that led to the Arab Spring, or the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. The death of Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing may have less impact because the emotional pitch of the anti-military movement is already extraordinarily high, with outrage over the coup being expressed all over Myanmar. Where it may already have had an impact is on the tactics of the security forces. Since her death they have largely avoided confrontations with the big rallies in Myanmar's cities, focussing instead on raiding neighbourhoods at night to try to arrest those involved in organising and funding the movement. The current strategy of the military government appears to be to wait the protests out, rather than try to suppress them now, calculating that economic hardship and exhaustion will eventually drive people off the streets. Myanmar is in a year-long state of emergency after the military seized power. They claim the November election results were fraudulent but have not provided any evidence of that. Power has been handed to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, accused of possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law. Protesters are calling for her release, along with the release of other NLD members. The country is now seeing some of the largest demonstrations since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime. Clashes have taken place between security officers and protesters, and the military has also blocked the internet in a bid to stifle dissent. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011 A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Aung San Suu Kyi and her government were overthrown in an army coup on 1 February Thousands of people gathered in the largest city, Yangon, on Friday for further demonstrations. Many wore uniforms to demonstrate that they were boycotting work. ""Don't go to the office!"" they chanted, according to AFP. ""Go strike! Go strike!"" The mass protest marked two straight weeks of unrest in the country, but police have ramped up efforts to block the demonstrations. Officers sealed off Yangon's main protest site on Friday, and set-up barricades at an intersection where a major protest was held the previous day. But hundreds of people gathered at the barricades anyway, a witness told Reuters. Elsewhere, video footage posted on social media showed clashes between police and protesters in Myitkyina in northern Kachin state. Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

"Woman shot during Myanmar anti-coup protests diesMya Thwe Thwe Khaing, 20, is the first protester to die since the military coup on 1 February.","This video can not be played Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot during a demonstration, two days before her 20th birthday A young woman has become the first protester to die in the anti-coup demonstrations in Myanmar after she was shot in the head last week. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was injured two days before her 20th birthday when police tried to disperse protesters. Her wound was consistent with one from live ammunition, rights groups said. An image of the protester being cradled after she was shot was widely shared, and her death has triggered further anger against the authorities. Myanmar has seen days of protests following a military coup which overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. The police have denied using lethal force at the rally in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on 9 February, but doctors have said two other protesters were also struck by live rounds. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The shooting of a young protester The hospital in the city confirmed the protester's death at 11:00 local time (04:30 GMT). A funeral service will be held on Sunday, her family said. ""I want to encourage all the citizens to join the protests until we can get rid of this system,"" her sister, Mya Tha Toe Nwe, told reporters. ""That's all I want to say."" Authorities said they would investigate the case. The supermarket worker took part in the mass protest which saw police use water cannon against protesters who refused to retreat. Her brother had begged her not to join the demonstrations out of fear they could turn violent. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing travelled to the protest with her sisters from Yezin, a village north-east of the capital. Her brother warned her to stay at the back in case police started shooting. ""They wouldn't,"" she told him over the phone. A memorial was erected in the capital on Friday Video of the moment she was shot appeared to show her standing some distance from the police. She was placed on life support when she was taken to hospital and remained there until she died. ""We will look for justice and move forward,"" a doctor told AFP news agency, adding that staff had faced immense pressure since she was taken to their intensive care unit. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's family are all supporters of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). Her brother said she voted for the first time in last November's general election, which the NLD won by a landslide. ""We are heartbroken and cannot talk about it much now,"" he told AFP on Friday. ""It was such a waste. I feel terribly sorry as if [she was] my own family,"" one woman told the BBC in Yangon. ""I also want democracy. [Only then] will her sacrificed life not be wasted."" Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing is the first martyr for what has grown into a nationwide civil disobedience campaign in Myanmar. Her image has become one of the defining motifs of an already visually rich and imaginative protest movement - it has been copied in paint and hung, on huge posters, from overpasses in Yangon. The anger over her death is all the greater because it appeared so gratuitous; the police were not under serious pressure when they opened fire, and she was some distance from them, and appeared about to move back. High profile deaths have often been turning points for movements in other countries: the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, setting off protests that led to the Arab Spring, or the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. The death of Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing may have less impact because the emotional pitch of the anti-military movement is already extraordinarily high, with outrage over the coup being expressed all over Myanmar. Where it may already have had an impact is on the tactics of the security forces. Since her death they have largely avoided confrontations with the big rallies in Myanmar's cities, focussing instead on raiding neighbourhoods at night to try to arrest those involved in organising and funding the movement. The current strategy of the military government appears to be to wait the protests out, rather than try to suppress them now, calculating that economic hardship and exhaustion will eventually drive people off the streets. Myanmar is in a year-long state of emergency after the military seized power. They claim the November election results were fraudulent but have not provided any evidence of that. Power has been handed to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, accused of possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law.

"UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nationsAt a virtual G7 meeting, Boris Johnson will encourage other rich countries to donate vaccine doses.UK PoliticsComments","Boris Johnson speaks to G7 leaders by video link Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement,externalcommitting to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Timesricher countries should send up to 4 to 5%of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this. A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"UK Supreme Court rules Uber drivers are workersThe ride hailing app's drivers are workers rather than self-employed, the court says.Business","Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning Â£30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than Â£1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability. Tom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time. He thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications,externalfor a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers. ""The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing. ""This is even more important in the context of the pandemic."" As for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016. ""Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,"" she said. Dr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees. He told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these ""rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals"". This means that ""in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]"".

Wales FM hopes 'stay home' rule can end in March,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

"Max the Miracle Dog gets 'animal OBE' honourThe 13-year-old therapy dog brings peace and joy to many, according to owner Kerry Irving.Cumbria","This video can not be played Meet Max the Miracle Dog, the first pet getting the ""animal OBE"" A therapy dog who has found fame online is being given a top honour by vet charity PDSA. Videos of Max the Miracle Dog's daily walks in the Lake District are watched by thousands of people. The 13-year-old springer spaniel will bethe first pet to receive the PDSA Order of Merit,external, with previous recipients including police and search and rescue animals. The dog's owner Kerry Irving saidMax saved his life and helps many others. Locksmith Kerry Irving shares daily videos of Max's walks on Facebook The PDSA, which nicknamed the honour the ""animal OBE"", said the ""positive and life-altering impact Max has on the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide is unprecedented"". A spokesman said Max's popularity on social media ""provides a feel-good factor"", and since 2017 the dog has also met more than 10,000 people and raised almost Â£300,000 for a number of charities. Going for a walk with Max the Miracle Dog Mr Irving, who lives in Keswick, met Max while he was suffering depression two years after being seriously injured in a car crash which left him with chronic pain. He said Max gave him the motivation to get out and walk, and he later adopted the dog after Max's owners decided to move to a city. After taking on Max, Kerry Irving went on to get two more spaniels called Paddy and Harry Mr Irving said: ""When I was at my lowest, Max became my reason to live and he continues to make me smile every day. Being able to share the support, comfort and joy that Max brings to thousands of people has been a privilege. ""We receive daily messages from people all over the world, saying how Max's adventures make them smile and bring joy to their life. Each has their own personal story. I have met soldiers who served in Afghanistan who say they used to look at Max's page to remind them of home. I've also received messages from NHS staff working on the frontline during the pandemic, who have found moments of peace and escape with Max."" Max has met more than 10,000 people including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said Max had become a ""true ambassador for the positive impact that animals have on mental health and wellbeing, which is more important now than ever"".

UK Supreme Court rules Uber drivers are workers,"Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam pose in front of the Supreme Court on Friday Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. The two,who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016,told the BBC they were ""thrilled and relieved"" by the ruling. ""I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,"" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). ""We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground."" Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal Uber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. The company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018. The ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. Delivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app. The court considered several elements in its judgement: Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve Looking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours. Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: ""We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. ""Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. ""We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see."" Uber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport. By not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares. The Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers ""workers"" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off. This is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app. Previously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car. ""This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,"" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary. ""The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion."" Mr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long. ""It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,"" he said. Uber drivers launch legal battle over 'favouritism' The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus Mr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic,many drivers have been struggling financially,externaland feel trapped in Uber's system. ""We're seeing many of our members earning Â£30 gross a day right now,"" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs. ""If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on."" That remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen. When Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business. The company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would ""incur significant additional expenses"" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime. ""Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,"" it added. Uber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares. This relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. Mr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. ""I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,"" he told the BBC. ""The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,"" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. ""It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than Â£1bn in VAT and interest."" HMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability. Tom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time. He thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications,externalfor a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers. ""The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing. ""This is even more important in the context of the pandemic."" As for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016. ""Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,"" she said. Dr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees. He told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these ""rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals"". This means that ""in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]"".

Dental schools 'may be unable to take on freshers'The British Dental Association Scotland warns of the knock-on effects of dental students having to repeat a year.Scotland,"Dental students have been unable to get face-to-face patient contact during the pandemic Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year. It was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic. Graduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year. Universities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year. A spokesman said: ""Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training. ""All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022. ""Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted."" Scotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year. The same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas. Savanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen. Her graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming. The reality, however, was still overwhelming. ""Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,"" she said. She conceded that the dental school being closed ""did have quite an impact"" on learning, as practical work was not possible. And there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. ""Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,"" she said. Ms Joyce said: ""I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended. ""We are all very accepting of the decisions,"" she added. The British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places. They said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come. David McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year. ""What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,"" he said. ""We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form. ""If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry."" At Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an ""inevitable and pragmatic decision"" to extend the training programme of existing dental students. He said: ""I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training."" Mr Swinney said he would be discussing the issues with the dental schools and the British Dental Association. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Macron: Send 4-5% of vaccines to poorer nations,"French President Emmanuel Macron said the uneven distribution of vaccines was accelerating global inequality French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe and the US to urgently send up to 5% of their coronavirus vaccine supplies to developing nations. Mr Macron told the Financial Times,externalthe failure to share vaccines fairly would entrench global inequality. The vast majority of vaccinations have been administered by high-income countries so far. Mr Macron proposed his plan to address the imbalance ahead of a G7 virtual summit of world leaders on Friday. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country How will Covid vaccines be shared with poorer countries? Canada defends taking vaccines from sharing scheme The White House has said US President Joe Biden will announce a pledge of $4bn (Â£2.8bn) in funding for a global vaccine-sharing scheme, known as Covax. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who will chair the meeting - is expected to dedicate surplus dosesto Covax. To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according tofigures from Johns Hopkins University,external. ""We're not talking about billions of doses immediately, or billions and billions of euros,""Mr Macron told the FT,external. ""It's about much more rapidly allocating 4-5% of the doses we have. ""It won't change our vaccination campaigns, but each country should set aside a small number of the doses it has to transfer tens of millions of them, but very fast, so that people on the ground see it happening."" Glendy Rivero became the first doctor in Venezuela to receive the Russian Sputnik V vaccine on Thursday Mr Macron said German Chancellor Angela Merkel supported a European vaccine-sharing initiative, adding that he hoped to win the backing of the US as well. In the absence of such a scheme, China and Russia were filling the gap, ""paving the way for a war of influence over vaccines"", Mr Macron said. Sputnik vaccine gives 92% protection in trial This video can not be played From the pandemic to measles, Smitha Mundasad looks at global health challenges in 2021 On Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres denounced the ""wildly uneven and unfair"" global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Richer nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines at the expense of poorer ones. Some high-income nations, such as the UK and Canada, have ordered enough doses to vaccinate their populations more than once. Health experts say that, unless vaccines are shared more equitably, it could be years before coronavirus is brought under control at a global level. But at this week's virtual meeting of the G7 - a club of seven leading economic powers - world leaders are expected to acknowledge the vaccine deficit between high- and low-income nations.

UK and around the world: Northern Ireland Assembly members will be able totake part remotely in assembly proceedings for the first time from Monday, according to a letter from the Speaker Alex Maskey sent today. Maskey asked assembly members (MLAs) to be patient as there could be ""teething problems"" in adapting to the new system. He also said MLAs should ensure they participate remotely from a location with ""good connectivity"". Some assembly members had called for remote proceedings, due to the pandemic. Avirtual system was set up at Westminsterlast year. Photos posted on Facebook allegedly showed Aftab Razaq attending the ceremony A Manchester councillor accused of breaching Covid restrictions by flying to Pakistan and attending a wedding has been suspended by the local Labour Party. Photos were shared on Facebook last weekend allegedly showingManchester City Councillor Aftab Razaqat the celebration in the city of Kharian. Under the current Covid-19 rules in the UK, it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfor holidays and other leisure purposes. Mr Razaq, 52, has yet to respond to the BBC's request for a comment. He was seen in the photos apparently ignoring social distancing and not wearing a mask, despite virus rules in Pakistan making this mandatory. It was initially believed that the virus originated at a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan In his interview with the BBC, the US Secretary of State has also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. Anthony Blinkenaccused China of failing to share informationthat might shed light on the origins of Covid-19. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. Blinken said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. This video can not be played US is 'determined to engage in the world' - Blinken ""America is back"" and fully engaged in helping resolve global issues including the pandemic,US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tells the BBC. In his first international interview, Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19, marking a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump. The US is giving $4bn (Â£2.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. ""Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,"" Blinken said. The US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. With thousands of schools still closed around the world, there are increasingly urgent warnings of the impact of the pandemic on millions of children.

Rather than risk another ""spike"" in infections, they are calling for a more ""cautious"" and ""phased"" return. Nine teachers and head teachers' unions have urged the government to commit to that date only if the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe. The prime minister is due to announce the plan for reopening schools on Monday. The collective statement from education unions says they are committed to bringing children back into the classroom as soon as possible - but have concerns it may lead to another surge in the virus. They say they are ""increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March"" - the government's target for opening schools. Here's a reminder of a few changes to lockdown restrictions in Wales announced in a press conference earlier by First Minister Mark Drakeford: Here's all you need to know about how Wales' rules are being loosened. The UK government'spledge to donate most of any surplus vaccine supply to poorer countrieshas been welcomed by Jose Manuel Barroso, chairman of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. He told BBC World News he was hopeful the virtual meeting of the G7 group of major economies would aid the process further. This video can not be played Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter A single dose of the Pfizer
vaccine prevented 85% of symptomatic Covid infections in healthcare workers at
one of Israel's largest hospitals. And, compared with a group of
people who hadnât had the vaccine yet, there were 75% fewer infections overall
â  including those that didn't cause any symptoms. The analysis was based on more
than 9,000 staff members, 15-28 days after their first dose. The authors said it provided
""support"" to delaying the second dose in countries facing vaccine
shortages. The UK opted to give more people
one dose of the vaccine, rather than a smaller group two doses three weeks
apart. The NHS still plans to offer
second doses within 12 weeks. The argument was that, in the
face of very high cases, this would save more lives and protect more people
from severe disease. Although a relatively small
piece of analysis, it appears to offer some vindication to this strategy. It suggests just one dose â once
you wait the roughly two weeks it takes for protection to kick in - gave a very
high level of protection against disease. And it gave significant protection
against even carrying the virus. The researchers looked at days
15-28 after one dose of the vaccine, since thatâs the period after immunity has
begun to develop but before a second dose has had time to take effect. In Israel, second doses are
being given around the 21-day mark and are expected to take effect after about
a week - less time than the first dose takes because the immune system has
already been primed. The country has more or less
unfettered access to all the vaccine it needs, since it has struck a deal with
manufacturer in exchange for handing over large amounts of data, allowing Pfizer
to monitor how well it is working in a whole population. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in the UK has fallen below 20,000 for the first time since December, with the latest figuresreporting 19,392 hospital cases,external. The last time the figures dropped below this threshold was 20 December, when there were 19,455 people in hospital with Covid. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport While Covid-19 vaccine passports are ""feasible"", we need to know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said. They also have thepotential to discriminateagainst the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons. This must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report. It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan, including having a way to accommodate ""changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants"". And a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws. It is also vital to be clear about what the passports would be used for - whether that's international travel or greater domestic freedoms - the report outlined.

The first case of the variant was discovered near the city of Suwalki in north-eastern Poland, Niedzielski says. About 10% of Covid-19 cases in Poland are now the UK variant. Niedzielski says there has been a very dynamic increase in new infections in the past two weeks. ""Looking at the results it must be said that the third wave of the pandemic is already in Poland,"" he tells a news conference. The seven-day average this week exceeded 6,500 cases, he says, 1,000 more than in previous weeks. He also says the number of patients requiring hospital treatment, which had been decreasing, has reversed in the past week. The trend reversal comes just a week after Poland allowed ski slopes to reopen, as well as hotels, cinemas and theatres reopening at half capacity. Officials have said restrictions would be reinstated if cases rise significantly. On Friday, Poland reported 8,777 new cases in the previous 24 hours and 241 virus-related deaths. The number of new daily cases this week has been the highest in more than a month. Poland has vaccinated 2.56 million people, equivalent to 6.8% of the population, including 865,884 people who has received both doses, or 2.3% of the population. The number of people living in poverty in Indonesia has grown by more than 10% since the pandemic began in 2020, statistics show Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell has urged the government to think again about cutting the aid budget, saying he was ""far from sure"" the House of Commons would back the move in the middle of the pandemic. The Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One: âA very large number of colleagues on all sides of the House of Commons think this is not the time to cut aid and development."" If the cut went ahead, Mr Mitchell said the UK ""would have to stop making a lot of the planned vaccinations, cut the number of girls going to school, the number of people getting access to clean water"". ""A cut like that would lead to hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths mainly amongst children,â he added. He pointed out that where all other G7 countries were increasing aid, the UK - which is currently hosting a G7 meeting, was the only country proposing a cut. ""Iâm sure that the government will want to think again about this and I think the House of Commons is likely to insist that the government does."" Boris Johnson hosted the virtual meeting of G7 leaders The leaders of the G7 nations have agreed to ""intensify co-operation"" in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Following a virtual meeting hosted by Boris Johnson, they pledged to work together and with the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate global vaccine development and deployment. In a joint statement, they said: ""We reaffirm our support for all pillars of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), its Covax facility, and affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" They announced increased financial commitments totalling US$7.5bn (Â£5.3bn). The statement continued: ""We invite all partners, including the G20 and international financial institutions, to join us in increasing support to ACT-A, including to increase developing countries' access to WHO-approved vaccines through the Covax facility. ""Covid-19 shows that the world needs stronger defences against future risks to global health security."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News New data put forward by Pfizer-BioNTech suggests their Covid
vaccine could be stored at slightly warmer temperatures for a certain period of time,
making it easier to store and transport. Currently, the vaccine needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures - between -80C and -60C - which has meant special containers are required to
move shipments around. It can then be kept in a fridge for five days before being used. Now the company says its vaccine remains stable when stored
at -25C to -15C - the temperature of pharmaceutical
freezers - for two weeks. This could take place instead of, or alongside, storage at the very low
temperatures, giving GPs, pharmacies and vaccination centres more
flexibility in how they manage their supplies. It may also make providing this vaccine to populations
across the world a little less daunting. One advantage of the Oxford-AZ vaccine has always been that
it can be stored at the same temperature as a household fridge. The data collected by Pfizer has been handed to the US
authorities and it would need to be run past other regulators in other
countries too before any rules around the vaccine's storage could be changed. As of Thursday, some 16,875,536 people in the UK had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, up by 452,454 doses on the previous day. And 589,591 had received a second dose, up by 15,867 on the previous day. Returning to the UK's other daily figures, the number of cases - 12,027 - is down by just over 20% on last Friday, and the number of deaths - 533 - is down by nearly 30%. The figures for Wednesday and Thursday this week were both close to the level seen on the previous week, but that hasnât kept going today, BBC News head of statistics Robert Cuffe says. The rolling seven day averages are also down - 20% and 28% respectively. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
University watchdog faces 'impartiality' questionsLord Wharton is also a paid adviser to an energy firm trying to build through a university's land.Family & Education,"Lord Wharton's appointment has already faced accusations of ""cronyism"" England's new university regulator is facing questions about a potential conflict of interest. Lord Wharton has been appointed chair of the Office for Students (OfS) but is also a paid adviser to a firm Aquind, which wants to build a cable linking the UK and French electricity grids. The Â£1.2bn project would be built through the University of Portsmouth, which is strongly opposed to the route. The OfS says protections are in place to prevent conflicts of interest. ""Where there is a conflict related to an individual higher education provider we would expect the relevant board member to exclude themselves from any decisions directly related to that provider,"" said a spokesman for the OfS university watchdog. But the OfS declined to say whether that would specifically apply to the University of Portsmouth and its incoming chair, Conservative peer, Lord Wharton. The University of Portsmouth says any ""perceived conflict of interest"" needs to be ""transparently managed"". Aquind director Alexander Temerko has made financial donations to Conservative politicians The electricity cable ""interconnector"" plan has prompted much local protest in Portsmouth - with both Labour and Conservative MPs in the city opposing its digging through such a densely-populated area. The city council's planning officials said the prospect of it being pushed through with the compulsory acquisition of land was ""draconian"" and an ""interference with human rights"". The University of Portsmouth, whose land it would run through, is concerned about disruption to sporting facilities and says it would have a ""huge negative impact"" and leave it facing financial losses. Aquind firmly rejects the university's claims, saying the impact would be ""minimal"", work would be carried out in a way that reduced disruption and the route of the ""underground cable corridor has been amended and refined"" in response to earlier feedback. But the university will now face Lord Wharton both as someone working for Aquind, on the opposing side in this commercial dispute, and also the chair of the regulator, which has powers to impose fines and sanctions on universities such as itself. While there is no suggestion of impropriety in either role, as paid private adviser or incoming publicly-funded watchdog, there are questions being asked about an overlap. Boris Johnson and Alexander Temerko Portsmouth South MP, Stephen Morgan, questioned whether Lord Wharton could appear to be impartial. ""We know Aquind has links to Tory donors. But to be advising a firm responsible for this project while it is being challenged by a university Wharton is set to regulate, raises serious red flags about his impartiality, particularly if he keeps the Conservative whip. ""These revelations cast fresh doubt over Lord Wharton's suitability for this key role,"" said Mr Morgan, Labour's shadow minister for the armed forces. ""The potential conflicts of interest keep on mounting for Lord Wharton of Yarm,"" said Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union. Before the latest lockdown, there were protests in Portsmouth against the Aquind construction project The Department for Education says there is an ""extensive code of guidance"" to guard against a conflict of interest and that as chair, ""Lord Wharton would not be involved in individual regulatory decisions about universities"". It has also rejected accusationsmade by Labour about ""cronyism"", where his appointment had been linked to his political connections, saying the process was ""in line with the governance code on public appointments"". An Aquind spokesman says its adviser Lord Wharton had no part in ""determining the location of the underground cables or in the ongoing engagement with Portsmouth University"". His work for Aquind has been recorded in the House of Lords register of interests. The backers of the electricity scheme have also attracted attention. A director of Aquind is Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born businessman who has become a prominent financial donor to Conservative MPs. Mr Temerko's website shows the businessman with Lord Wharton at conferences and events It also shows him with senior politicians, including Education Secretary Gavin Williamson Mr Temerko's website has numerous pictures of himself with Aquind adviser Lord Wharton,externalat his side, at conferences, fundraisers and social events with other prominent Conservatives, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for whom Lord Wharton was a manager of his leadership campaign. The photos on Mr Temerko's website also show the businessman with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who appointed Lord Wharton to chair the Office for Students earlier this month. Lord Wharton's links with Mr Temerko go back before his role as Aquind's adviser. Records from the Electoral Commission show Mr Temerko made four donations to him, amounting to Â£25,000, between 2013 and 2016, when he was a Conservative MP. The Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, said Lord Wharton's work for Aquind's ""subsea electricity connector"" would be ""part-time, paid, strategic adviser to the company - acting as a sounding board for the company's ideas and future plans/ strategy of the business"". The University of Portsmouth is concerned about a ""huge negative impact"" from the cable going through its land This was in August 2017 when he had stopped being an MP and minister and was seeking their advice over taking up his new job with Aquind. The business secretary will make the decision later this year on whether the Aquind interconnector gets the go-ahead. The previous secretary of state, Alok Sharma, whose local constituency party had received a donation from Aquind of Â£10,000, had to recuse himself from any part in the decision-making process. Conservative MP David Morris, another recipient of a donation, had to apologise to the House of Commons for a breach of paid advocacy rules after asking a question in support of the Aquind cable project. Aquind says that all of its political donations have ""complied with the relevant legislations"". Local campaign groupsopposed to putting the Aquind cable through Portsmouthhave complained of the threat to the environment and the disruption caused by the construction. The university says it is not against the principle of the project, but its objections are about what it will mean in practice. ""The objections relate to the impact on the operation of the site and future development potential. The current plans will cause disruption to the provision of facilities to students and the local community, which together will impact the university's business,"" said a university spokesman. ""We are continuing our dialogue with Aquind to try to reach a resolution and find a route which does not have the huge negative impact on the university as is currently proposed. ""Lord Wharton's appointment does not change the basis of our objection and we have full confidence in him acting in his new position. We hope that any perceived conflict of interest on this matter will be able to be appropriately and transparently managed by all those involved."" But Aquind says it has already made changes to ""minimise any impact on open spaces"" and to respect environmental concerns. The energy firm says that the interconnector link would provide cheaper and greener electricity for consumers in the UK. The Office for Students said its new chair Lord Wharton did not want to comment.

UK and around the world: Northern Ireland Assembly members will be able totake part remotely in assembly proceedings for the first time from Monday, according to a letter from the Speaker Alex Maskey sent today. Maskey asked assembly members (MLAs) to be patient as there could be ""teething problems"" in adapting to the new system. He also said MLAs should ensure they participate remotely from a location with ""good connectivity"". Some assembly members had called for remote proceedings, due to the pandemic. Avirtual system was set up at Westminsterlast year. Photos posted on Facebook allegedly showed Aftab Razaq attending the ceremony A Manchester councillor accused of breaching Covid restrictions by flying to Pakistan and attending a wedding has been suspended by the local Labour Party. Photos were shared on Facebook last weekend allegedly showingManchester City Councillor Aftab Razaqat the celebration in the city of Kharian. Under the current Covid-19 rules in the UK, it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfor holidays and other leisure purposes. Mr Razaq, 52, has yet to respond to the BBC's request for a comment. He was seen in the photos apparently ignoring social distancing and not wearing a mask, despite virus rules in Pakistan making this mandatory. It was initially believed that the virus originated at a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan In his interview with the BBC, the US Secretary of State has also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged. Anthony Blinkenaccused China of failing to share informationthat might shed light on the origins of Covid-19. A team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards thatChina refused to grant full access to the data they sought. Blinken said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. ""It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,"" he said. This video can not be played US is 'determined to engage in the world' - Blinken ""America is back"" and fully engaged in helping resolve global issues including the pandemic,US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tells the BBC. In his first international interview, Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19, marking a break with the ""America First"" policy of Donald Trump.

across the world a little less daunting. One advantage of the Oxford-AZ vaccine has always been that
it can be stored at the same temperature as a household fridge. The data collected by Pfizer has been handed to the US
authorities and it would need to be run past other regulators in other
countries too before any rules around the vaccine's storage could be changed. As of Thursday, some 16,875,536 people in the UK had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, up by 452,454 doses on the previous day. And 589,591 had received a second dose, up by 15,867 on the previous day. Returning to the UK's other daily figures, the number of cases - 12,027 - is down by just over 20% on last Friday, and the number of deaths - 533 - is down by nearly 30%. The figures for Wednesday and Thursday this week were both close to the level seen on the previous week, but that hasnât kept going today, BBC News head of statistics Robert Cuffe says. The rolling seven day averages are also down - 20% and 28% respectively. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nationsAt a virtual G7 meeting, Boris Johnson will encourage other rich countries to donate vaccine doses.","Boris Johnson speaks to G7 leaders by video link Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement,externalcommitting to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Timesricher countries should send up to 4 to 5%of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this. A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

UK borrowing hits highest January level on record,"UK government borrowing hit Â£8.8bn last month, the highest January figure since records began in 1993, reflecting the  cost of pandemic support measures. It was the first time in 10 years that more has been borrowed in January than collected through tax and other income. January is usually a key revenue-raising month as it is when taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns. Tax income fell by less than Â£1bn, but the government spent Â£19.7bn more than last year on measures such as furlough. Government borrowing for this financial year has now reached Â£270.6bn, which is Â£222bn more than a year ago,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwhich published the data. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. That would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War. The borrowing figure was lower than expected but that ""should not be interpreted as a signal that the economy is withstanding the third lockdown relatively well"", said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""A sharp Â£2.1bn year-over-year decline in interest payments, and the vanishing of contributions to the EU's budget, which totalled Â£2.2bn in January 2020, helped,"" he pointed out. The increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.11 trillion. The UK's overall debt has now reached 97.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. Where does the government borrow billions from? Almost 2 million 'have not worked for six months' Warnings inflation could breach 2% as prices rise The ONS warned that although the impact of the pandemic on the public finances is becoming clearer, ""its effects are not fully captured"" in the current data, and that its estimates of tax receipts and borrowing are ""subject to greater than usual uncertainty"". It is an almost unbroken rule - January is a time when the Treasury coffers fill and more is paid in than is spent. But for the first time since the financial crisis, the Government had to borrow money in January to make up the gap between what it spent and what it raised in taxes. This near Â£9bn deficit though was actually better than expectations of Â£25bn of January borrowing. Receipts from taxes on workers and businesses held up on last year. The borrowing was mainly about Â£8bn extra spending on things like vaccines, protective equipment and testing, and support for jobs and wages up Â£5bn on last January. Over the course of this financial year the public finances are heading for borrowing of around Â£350bn - less bad than forecasts closer to Â£400bn, but still a peacetime record. This is the backdrop to the chancellor's budget in a fortnight, where he vows to be open and honest with the public about this challenge, suggesting tax rises at some point. The immediate focus though will have to remain on supporting the economy, as it is cautiously reopened. Hospitality companies have been excused from paying business rates and home buyers have had a break from paying stamp duty since July. Both these factors meant a drop in revenue for the government. But alcohol duty has risen by a quarter and self-assessed income tax receipts were Â£1.4bn higher. Overall, tax income fell about 1% to Â£80.3bn. Some of the self-assessed income tax gain probably came from the government's policy of allowing some later payments that were due from July, the ONS noted. In the 10 months to January, self-assessed income tax receipts were Â£26.3bn, Â£2bn less than in the same period a year earlier. More than has been Â£46bn spent covering salaries as part of the furlough scheme, and tens of billions of pounds on guaranteeing loans to businesses. In all, the Government has launched more than 40 schemes across the UK to help households and businesses through the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Since the start of the pandemic we've invested over Â£280bn to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods across the UK - this is the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support sustainable public finances in the medium term."" In his Budget on 3 March, ""the Chancellor likely won't shy away from setting out plans for borrowing to remain very high in 2021/22, probably close to 10% of GDP,"" said Mr Tombs. He predicted that the chancellor will also be able to avoid setting out future tax rises for 2022 and beyond, if the OBR maintains its upbeat view on the amount of long-term scarring caused by the recent downturn. But he warned that upward pressure on spending will increase over the coming years as the population ages and the Conservatives invest more to ""level up"" the country. ""As a result, big tax rises eventually will have to be announced, with 2022 likely to be the worst year,"" said Mr Tombs. The Budget will aim to secure the recovery, not to fix the public finances, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said earlier this week. That means substantial tax rises should not be part of the coming Budget, it said. ""Rishi Sunak needs to strike a balance between continuing support for jobs and businesses harmed by lockdowns, and weaning the economy off blanket support which will impede necessary economic adjustment,"" said Paul Johnson, IFS director. ""For now, Mr Sunak needs to focus on support and recovery. A reckoning in the form of big future tax rises is highly likely, but not as yet inevitable."" How does the government borrow money?

"Ted Cruz flew to Mexico as Texans froze in stormsThe Republican defends his family's Cancun trip during the crisis, saying he wanted ""to be a good dad"".US & Canada","Senator Ted Cruz takes questions at the Cancun airport on 18 February Texas Senator Ted Cruz has attempted to defend taking a family trip to Mexico amid a winter storm that left millions in his state without power and water. Mr Cruz said on Thursday he planned the holiday for his daughters, ""wanting to be a good dad"", but had returned because it ""didn't feel right"". Photos of the Republican lawmaker at an airport on Wednesday fuelled outrage at how he had left Texas during a crisis. Millions of people in Texas face water shortages, with reservoirs near empty. Freezing temperatures have caused power blackouts at water treatment facilities and burst water pipes supplying homes, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets. About 13 million Texans have been told to boil water that may be contaminated. Texas residents told to boil water in winter storm Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now The moment the crowd turned on Ted Cruz Mr Cruz, a high-profile Republican who ran for the US presidency in 2016, has not only drawn criticism for taking the international trip, but also for reportedly leaving his dog, Snowflake, behind. A New York Magazine reporter tweeted an image early on Thursday that appeared to show the senator's home, with Snowflake visible through the glass of the front door. Allow Twitter content?

The canine was reportedly being cared for by a security guard. In a written statement released on Thursday afternoon, Mr Cruz said that with schools closed in the state, he had booked the vacation for his young daughters who ""asked to take a trip with friends"". The senator said he and his staff were ""in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas"". Mr Cruz did not apologise for making the trip amid the state of emergency in Texas, butin a later interview with broadcaster ABC13, he said it was ""a mistake"",external. ""In hindsight, if I had understood how it would be perceived, the reaction people would have, obviously I wouldn't have done it,"" he said, adding that he had had ""second thoughts as soon as we left"" and understood why people were ""upset"". ""Leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn't feel right, and so I changed my return flight and flew back on the first available flight I could take,"" he said. Mr Cruz returned to Texas on Thursday The Republican has now returned to Houston. As a federal lawmaker, Mr Cruz does not have a direct role in Texas' emergency response, but residents often reach out to their elected officials - like Mr Cruz - during natural disasters for help accessing resources. The senator's travel plans amid the crisis in Texas drew immediate criticism online. ""People in Texas are literally freezing to death and yet Ted Cruz went on vacation to Cancun,"" wrote Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal on Twitter. ""Ted Cruz not only fled the state while millions of vulnerable Texans are without heat and water but specifically diverted police resources to get him through security and crowds faster for his outgoing vacation flight,"" wrote progressive rights activist Charlotte Clymer on Twitter.

Some criticised Mr Cruz for appearing to use his daughters to deflect blame. Journalist Leah Binkovitz appeared to mock the senator, writing on Twitter: ""I relate to Ted Cruz because my kids have also asked tough questions of me lately like, 'what happens if we run out of food and water'."" The chairman of the Republican Party in Texas, Allen West, said Mr Cruz ""has to answer to his constituents"" for the decisions he has made during the current winter weather crisis. But some conservatives came to Mr Cruz's defence - author and activist Brigitte Gabriel wrote: ""Senator Ted Cruz is one of the hardest working men in the country, he deserves a vacation."" Mr Cruz's trip to Mexico also raised concerns among other parents whose children attend the same private school in Houston as his daughters. The school's policy states thatstudents who travel abroad cannot return to classrooms for seven days,externalafter returning home, the New York Times reported. It adds that students must take a coronavirus test within three to five days of returning, which must then produce a negative result before they can return to classrooms. Others suggested the added scrutiny may hurt Mr Cruz as he reportedly contemplates a second presidential bid in 2024. The lawmaker's current Senate term will expire in early 2025. At least 47 storm-related deaths have been reported and hospitals have been placed under severe pressure. Food supplies in supermarkets are running low and residents are struggling to keep warm in some of the coldest temperatures the state has seen in more than 30 years - hitting 0F (-18C) earlier this week. Texas family 'trying to keep warm' Texas has opted out of the national power grids, and so has been particularly hard hit by the exceptional conditions. Outages are expected to continue for days. This video can not be played 'Heâs 92 so we wrapped him tight like a mummy' Governor Greg Abbott has asked residents to shut off water to their home if possible to help keep pressure up amid concerns over the disruption in supply to hospitals. Mr Cruz had been active on Twitter in recent days, sharing updates about power in the state. In his Thursday statement, Mr Cruz said that his family had also lost heat and power, just like other Texans. ""The greatest state in the greatest country in the world has been without power,"" he said.

"Two million not given flight refunds, Which? saysHolidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund.Business","Millions of people are out of pocket on flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, according to consumer group Which?. Holidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund. More than two million people have not got their money back, Which? said. Travel restrictionsremain in place in the UK, with travellers arriving from ""high-risk"" countries having to stay in quarantine hotels. Most of the people who were unable to take flights were hit by circumstances which meant they reasonably, or in some cases, legally, could not travel to their destination, Which? said. It is warning people to be wary of booking flights for this summer and to wait until the situation around international travel becomes clearer. The consumer group said in the longer-term booking a package holiday rather than a flight-only booking should give stronger passenger protections. People should only book with a trusted provider with a generous and flexible booking policy, it said. Rebecca Howe said Ryanair would not refund her family's flights Travel restrictions introduced at the Spanish border on Christmas Eve meant the Howe family couldn't take their trip to Lanzarote. They were able to cancel their accommodation free of charge, but it was a different story with their flights. ""We asked for a refund, but was told as the flight was still operating, we weren't entitled,"" Rebecca Howe told the BBC. It has left the family Â£980 out of pocket, and they're far from alone in losing cash paid for flights. Hopeful holidaymakers have been prevented from travelling because of local or national lockdowns and restrictions preventing entry at their destination, or the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office advising against non-essential travel. But in cases where the airline did not cancel the flight, customers may not be legally entitled to a refund or guaranteed a successful claim through their travel insurance or bank. Covid: Four fined in Birmingham over red-list travel Covid-19: 'Too early' to decide on summer holidays, says Hancock Lastminute.com faces legal action over holiday refunds Which? said passengers in these circumstances would often have only been given the choice of rebooking their flight or losing their money. Rebecca Howe said she was offered the choice to rebook her Ryanair flights for free up until the end of March, but that was no good. ""For one thing all the Ryanair flights to Lanzarote between Christmas and the end of March were less than half the price as we paid a premium to travel over New Year. ""If we'd accepted a cheaper flight, we would have lost the difference."" But with the only practical date available for the family to go was February half-term, even that was no good. ""Someone at my work had already it booked as annual leave so I couldn't take the time off as we are only allowed one person out."" They're now trying to reclaim the money via a chargeback request through their bank, ""But there's no guarantee it'll be successful so at the moment we're accepting we have lost the money."" Donna Smullen and her husband were left Â£500 out of pocket after Ryanair declined to refund them Donna Smullen and her husband from Cheshire had booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in September 2019, long before the start of the pandemic. They were due to travel in August 2020, but at the end of July, the FCDO warned against non-essential travel to Spain. That warning invalidates most travel insurance. A two-week quarantine was also introduced for flights returning from mainland Spain. Due to their jobs, quarantining was not an option for the couple. ""We were told by Ryanair we could change the date of our flights for a fee of â¬30 to â¬90 (Â£26 to Â£78) per person per flight, as long as we travelled before the end of 2020,"" she said. That meant rebooking would have been more expensive than the flights themselves, so they took the hit and were left more than Â£500 out of pocket. Ryanair said that passengers who book non-refundable flights are not entitled to refunds if they choose not to travel on flights which have operated. However, passengers can avoid being out of pocket by ""availing of Ryanair's change facility, even for bookings which were made prior to any Covid-19 flight restrictions being introduced."" Which? has shared its findings with the CMA to aidan investigation,externalinto whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""With non-essential travel currently illegal, airlines must play their part in protecting public health by ensuring no-one is left out of pocket for abiding by the law and not travelling.

Wales plans wider school return from 15 March,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

US agrees to join nuclear talks with Iran,"The US and European powers have called on Iran to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US aimed at reviving a nuclear deal, America ""must act"" first and lift sanctions. ""Gestures are fine,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted, adding: ""Remember, Trump left the room."" Iran vowed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions under the 2015 deal. But former US President Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018. The move led Iran to roll back its commitments. The US has now expressed intent to rejoin the deal under President Joe Biden. Clock ticks in Iran as rivals square up After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words On Thursday, the Biden administration made its firmest pledge yet to re-engage with Iran over the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). State department spokesman Ned Price said the US would accept an invitation from the European Union to meet Iran for talks. Senior EU diplomat Enrique Moratweeted he was ""ready to invite"" all parties to talks,external, saying this was a ""critical moment"" for the deal. But Mr Khatibzadeh later said that Tehran would only ""respond"" to calls to revive the deal after the Biden administrationlifted all sanctions,external. Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also suggested on Friday that the country wouldonly comply with the deal fully once US sanctions had been lifted,external, saying it would then ""immediately reverse"" its actions. Iran has ratcheted up pressure on the Biden administration, threatening to block international inspections of its nuclear sites within days if the US does not lift sanctions. Since the US withdrew from the deal, Iran, which says its nuclear programme is peaceful, has resumed or begun nuclear activities barred under its terms. This has heightened concern among the parties to the deal, who suspect Iran's intentions. In response, the US and its European allies - the UK, France and Germany - have called on Iran to refrain from blocking inspections, warning jointly that the move would be ""dangerous"". On Thursday, the four powers said they shared a commitment to ensuring Iran could ""never develop a nuclear weapon"". The offer of an initial meeting hosted by the EU to get around the stand-off over who moves first in the complex path back to the nuclear deal would have been the first substantial diplomacy with Iran in more than four years. To show good faith, the Biden administration eased stringent travel restrictions on Iran's UN diplomats imposed by Mr Trump. It also reversed his effort to restore all UN sanctions on Iran. When it comes to American sanctions, Mr Biden says he'll lift them once Iran has resumed compliance with the deal. But Iran has demanded an end to US sanctions by the weekend, threatening to limit inspections of nuclear sites if it doesn't. The US and other Western powers have urged it against taking what they call a step backward when they're ready to move forward. Iran's reaction to that statement was dismissive. Suspicions that Iran was using its nuclear programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose sanctions in 2010. In 2015, Iran reached a deal with six powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - that saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to access sites and facilities. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? Mr Trump abandoned the deal in May 2018 and reinstated US sanctions. He wanted a new deal that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. Iran refused and, when the sanctions took effect, was plunged into an economic crisis. Since sanctions were tightened in 2019, Iran has moved to stop international inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment in breach of the deal.

"Unblock Covid logjam for new laws, senior MPs urge","Crucial government policies have been held up too long by the Covid crisis, ministers have been told. Senior MPs say new laws, including on post-Brexit environmental standards and sentencing reform, should be put back on the agenda. It comes after debating time for non-Covid topics was scaled back to make way for emergency laws and statements. But select committee chairs said it was time for delayed bills to return. MPs' chance to pitch laws suspended due to Covid Plans to protect the environment delayed again Speaker rebukes ministers over coronavirus powers The demand has been made by the powerful cross-party liaison committee, which includes the heads of each Commons select committee. In a letter to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, the committee's chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said the pandemic had ""understandably impacted"" time for new bills. ""But now that this is closer to being under control, we would urge the government to deliver on its commitments to and demands from select committees on other vitally important legislation,"" he added. The Conservative MP called on the government - which sets time for almost all new laws - to give ""due priority"" to certain bills over the next year. He added that this legislation, whose next stage in Parliament has yet to be set by the government, included: a new law totoughen up jail termsfor the worst cases of animal cruelty, introduced in the Commons last February a new Employment Bill, which is expected to ensure workers receive tips in full, among other measures a draft Sentencing Bill to increase sentences for violent criminals, announced at the December 2019 Queen's Speech Sir Bernard added that the reintroduction of the Environment Bill should be a ""government priority,"" to fill a ""gap"" in regulations since the UK left the Brexit transition period. Campaigners have reacted angrily to repeated delays to the legislation, which was first launched back in July 2018 and sets new targets for protecting nature. He said he was also keen for MPs to hold initial debates on draft government bills for reforming the rental market and overhauling England's planning system. He also called on ministers to publish legislation to ban""gay conversion therapy""and on tougher sentences for dangerous driving, where they have promised action but legislation has not yet been published. And he added that bills put forward by MPs, including one on regulating forensic science, were unlikely to pass before the current session ends. This is because Friday sittings - when this type of bill is usually debated - have been suspended in a bid to reduce the risk of Covid to MPs and their staff. A government spokesman said: ""The Queen's Speech will outline the legislative programme for the next session in the usual way. ""The government welcomes scrutiny from select committees and will bring forward its legislative commitments when parliamentary time allows."" On gay conversion therapy, the government's equality hub spokesperson: ""Conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice that this government will take action on to stop.

"Facebook news ban 'bullying', says UK MP","Facebook's decision to block news content from its platform in Australia was ""bullying"" and ""staggeringly irresponsible"", the chairman of the Commons media committee has said. Conservative MP Julian Knight told the BBC the move represented ""the worst type of corporate culture"", coming in the middle of the Covid pandemic. Facebook was responding to a proposed law requiring it pay for news content. The UK News Media Association said stricter regulation might be required. Australians on Thursday woke up to find thatFacebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable.People outside the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform. Facebook says the proposed legislation ""fundamentally misunderstands"" the relationship between the platform and publishers, adding that its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed. Australia vs tech firms: Whatâs this row about? Criticism grows over Facebook's Australia news ban Facebook to pay UK news publishers for content Mr Knight, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Select Committee, told Radio 4's PM programme it was a ""crass move"" by the company. He said: ""I think it's staggeringly irresponsible - at a time when we are facing a plethora of fake news and disinformation in relation to the Covid vaccine."" Mr Knight added: ""This is not just about Australia. This is Facebook putting a marker down, saying to the world that 'if you do wish to limit our powersâ¦ we can remove what is for many people a utility.'"" He said the events highlighted the need for competition rules to apply to social media firms in the UK, adding: ""The problem that I see is... that these platforms make enormous sums of money, and they make them from other people's work, and they aren't returning any equitable value to those people."" Search giant Google is also opposed to the Australian law, but it has in recent days signed payment deals with major media outlets in the country. In the UK,Facebook has agreed partnership dealswith publishers including the Daily Mail Group, Financial Times, the Guardian, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group. And the Competition and Markets Authority has announced it willenforce a new codeaimed at preventing tech firms from abusing their market dominance over advertising. But in a statement, Henry Faure Walker, chairman of the News Media Association which represents UK media organisations, echoed Mr Knight's comments, describing Facebook's ban as ""a classic example of a monopoly power being the school yard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves"". He said: ""Facebook's actions in Australia demonstrate precisely why we need jurisdictions across the globe, including the UK, to coordinate to deliver robust regulation to create a truly level playing field between the tech giants and news publishers."" The Guardian Media Group also said it was deeply concerned by Facebook's move ""at a time when facts and clarity are sorely needed"". A spokesman for the company said: ""Dominant online platforms are now a key gateway to news and information online. ""We believe that public interest journalism should be as widely available as possible in order to have a healthy functioning democracy."" Australia vs tech firms: Whatâs this row about?

"Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says","Millions of people are out of pocket on flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, according to consumer group Which?. Holidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund. More than two million people have not got their money back, Which? said. Travel restrictionsremain in place in the UK, with travellers arriving from ""high-risk"" countries having to stay in quarantine hotels. Most of the people who were unable to take flights were hit by circumstances which meant they reasonably, or in some cases, legally, could not travel to their destination, Which? said. It is warning people to be wary of booking flights for this summer and to wait until the situation around international travel becomes clearer. The consumer group said in the longer-term booking a package holiday rather than a flight-only booking should give stronger passenger protections. People should only book with a trusted provider with a generous and flexible booking policy, it said. Rebecca Howe said Ryanair would not refund her family's flights Travel restrictions introduced at the Spanish border on Christmas Eve meant the Howe family couldn't take their trip to Lanzarote. They were able to cancel their accommodation free of charge, but it was a different story with their flights. ""We asked for a refund, but was told as the flight was still operating, we weren't entitled,"" Rebecca Howe told the BBC. It has left the family Â£980 out of pocket, and they're far from alone in losing cash paid for flights. Hopeful holidaymakers have been prevented from travelling because of local or national lockdowns and restrictions preventing entry at their destination, or the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office advising against non-essential travel. But in cases where the airline did not cancel the flight, customers may not be legally entitled to a refund or guaranteed a successful claim through their travel insurance or bank. Covid: Four fined in Birmingham over red-list travel Covid-19: 'Too early' to decide on summer holidays, says Hancock Lastminute.com faces legal action over holiday refunds Which? said passengers in these circumstances would often have only been given the choice of rebooking their flight or losing their money. Rebecca Howe said she was offered the choice to rebook her Ryanair flights for free up until the end of March, but that was no good. ""For one thing all the Ryanair flights to Lanzarote between Christmas and the end of March were less than half the price as we paid a premium to travel over New Year. ""If we'd accepted a cheaper flight, we would have lost the difference."" But with the only practical date available for the family to go was February half-term, even that was no good. ""Someone at my work had already it booked as annual leave so I couldn't take the time off as we are only allowed one person out."" They're now trying to reclaim the money via a chargeback request through their bank, ""But there's no guarantee it'll be successful so at the moment we're accepting we have lost the money."" Donna Smullen and her husband were left Â£500 out of pocket after Ryanair declined to refund them Donna Smullen and her husband from Cheshire had booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in September 2019, long before the start of the pandemic. They were due to travel in August 2020, but at the end of July, the FCDO warned against non-essential travel to Spain. That warning invalidates most travel insurance. A two-week quarantine was also introduced for flights returning from mainland Spain. Due to their jobs, quarantining was not an option for the couple. ""We were told by Ryanair we could change the date of our flights for a fee of â¬30 to â¬90 (Â£26 to Â£78) per person per flight, as long as we travelled before the end of 2020,"" she said. That meant rebooking would have been more expensive than the flights themselves, so they took the hit and were left more than Â£500 out of pocket. Ryanair said that passengers who book non-refundable flights are not entitled to refunds if they choose not to travel on flights which have operated. However, passengers can avoid being out of pocket by ""availing of Ryanair's change facility, even for bookings which were made prior to any Covid-19 flight restrictions being introduced."" Which? has shared its findings with the CMA to aidan investigation,externalinto whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""With non-essential travel currently illegal, airlines must play their part in protecting public health by ensuring no-one is left out of pocket for abiding by the law and not travelling. ""All airlines should allow passengers the option to cancel for a full refund, as well as fee-free rebooking options, while these restrictions remain in place.""

More children could return to school from 15 March,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon.

The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"".

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Starmer targets savers in 'national recovery plan',"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says a new bond for money savers would provide a way for ""people to invest in the future of their country"" Millions of savers would be given a chance to invest in the UK's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, under proposals set out by Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader's British Recovery Bond scheme is the centrepiece of his alternative plan for ""national recovery"", ahead of 3 March's Budget. He also proposed start-up loans for 100,000 new small firms, especially in areas outside the South-East. The Conservatives said Sir Keir had stolen most of his ideas from them. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's plans to haul the UK economy out of the deepest recession in 300 years in his Budget speech next month. But Sir Keir said the Conservatives were ""incapable of seizing this moment"", adding: ""All we can expect from this government is more of the same. Labour would choose a different path."" The government said it has spent Â£280bn to help the economy through the pandemic, including tax breaks, grants and wage support for workers. Analysis: Starmer sets out to make public finances a team sport Labour attacks Sunak over Covid support strategy Under the radar: Labour's search for direction But Sir Keir told the BBC people would have to ""judge the government on its record"", with 10 years of ""weakening of our foundations, the pulling money out of our public services, the underfunding of the NHS and the failure to fix care homes"". In an interview with the BBC's deputy political editor, Vicki Young, the Labour leader said: ""You can't clap your keyworkers during a pandemic, then go back to business as usual and that is where this government will head. ""The first step has to be a recovery and a thriving economy, and if you put taxes up or you go for austerity, you will throttle that [before] you have even got to first base."" ""We have been through too much here and there is a parallel with [World War Two], where people have been through sacrifice and solidarity and they want a better future, and that is what I am setting out the path to."" Conservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling, accused Labour of stealing her party's policies, adding: ""After 10 months of Keir Starmer, all Labour has to offer is others' ideas, empty rhetoric and calling for things the government is already doing."" The main policy the Labour leader put forward was a British Recovery Bond. A Labour government would offer people a savings account with the government at a competitive interest rate - similar to the previous National Savings and Investments bonds. The cash raised would then be spent on rebuilding the country post-Covid. It comes off the back of figures from the Bank of England, which showed households had accumulated over Â£125bn in excess savings by November 2020 - estimated to hit Â£250bn by June 2021 - but with only around 5% of the savings expected to be spent, with much of the rest sitting in savings accounts. Sir Keir said this money could be used to ""invest in local communities, jobs and businesses"", as well as providing security for savers and giving ""millions of people a proper stake in Britain's future"". The Conservatives said the policy was the same as one proposed by the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, although that group's ""Northern Recovery Bond"" plan is not government policy. But speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said the chancellor was instead ""pinning a lot of hope on the idea that those who have saved during the pandemic... are going to spend all that money in the short term"". He added: ""I don't think that is realistic and I don't think the Bank of England does. What the bond does is provide a way for people to invest in the future of their country in a secure way, and obviously then releases money for infrastructure projects."" The pandemic has blurred political lines over the last year. The Conservatives have been forced to become big-spending big government. Meanwhile, Labour has been stuck between being criticised for being too supportive and, when it has been critical, being accused of carping from the sidelines. The point of this speech was to take voters out of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and remind them of the party politics of before. Although, of course, not exactly those politics, as this was also an opportunity for Sir Keir to address some of the pressure to start setting out his vision for Labour. So, there was a promise of continuing with significant government intervention in the economy but also of financial responsibility and of making business ""pivotal"". The big policy reveal of the speech -  British Recovery Bonds - neatly sums ups the aims Sir Keir set out of long-term investment, partnership and giving people a stake in society. But it relies on those who have been left better off from the pandemic, rather than the many who have not. Saving bonds are also known for being pretty low risk. The choice of this as a policy to unveil is unlikely to pacify those who would like to see Labour being more radical. Sir Keir also proposed to provide an extra Â£1bn of funding for the Start Up Loans Company, which provides finance for people wanting to launch their own businesses. The Labour leader said the scheme had offered less than 9,500 loans per year since it started in 2012, with nearly Â£1 in Â£4 going into London - compared to just 5.7% going to the North East. Sir Keir said targeting existing funding and tweaking the scheme would help to create 100,000 small businesses across the country. The Labour leader also reiterated his party's calls for the government to: Extend theweekly Â£20 increaseto universal credit benefits, introduced last year, beyond its scheduled end-date on 31 March Extend the business rates holiday and VAT cut offered to firms in the leisure and hospitality sectors beyond April Give local councils ""the funding they need"" to avoid having to usenew powers to raise council taxby up to 5%. A Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed until next month because of the coronavirus pandemic. Covid restrictions have prompted the government to spend billions in unprecedented interventions aimed at keeping the economy afloat during the crisis. This haspushed up UK debtto Â£2.13 trillion, equivalent to 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The chancellor is under pressure from MPs and industry groups to extend support measures, but also to spell out when and how the UK's debts can be paid down.

UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer countries,"Boris Johnson speaks to G7 leaders by video link Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly How many Covid vaccines has my country given? Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement,externalcommitting to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Timesricher countries should send up to 4 to 5%of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this. A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"UK to launch 'high risk' science agencyThe new agency will help ""cement the UK's position as a science superpower"", the government says.Business","The UK is to launch a ""high-risk"" science agency to look for ground-breaking discoveries. The agency, Aria, will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS. Aria, which has Â£800m funding over four years, will have a ""higher tolerance for failure than is normal"", the government said. Labour said the government needed to clarify what the agency would do. The new body - the Advanced Research & Invention Agency (Aria) - would fund ""high-risk, high-reward"" scientific research, the government said. But the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). For 2020-21 alone, the governmenthas allocated Â£10.36bn,externalfor its research programmes and bodies. Nevertheless, the government said that Aria would ""help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower"". Smart materials: From tiny robots to colour-swapping clothes AI used to 'predict the next coronavirus' Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the new agency would ""drive forward the technologies of tomorrow"" by ""stripping back unnecessary red tape"". ""From the steam engine to the latest artificial intelligence technologies, the UK is steeped in scientific discovery. Today's set of challenges - whether disease outbreaks or climate change - need bold, ambitious and innovative solutions. ""Led independently by our most exceptional scientists, this new agency will focus on identifying and funding the most cutting-edge research and technology at speed,"" Mr Kwarteng said. Boris Johnson's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings wasa prominent supporter of ""blue-sky"" thinking by small groups of scientists,external, saying in 2019 funding should be given to ""high-risk high-payoff visions"". It was the sale of the UK's artificial intelligence startup DeepMind to Google in 2014 which apparently got Dominic Cummings thinking. The man who was to become Boris Johnson's chief advisor became obsessed with the idea that the UK was giving away its technological crown jewels. The answer, he decided, was to create a British version of Arpa, the American agency credited with funding the development of the internet and GPS. Despite Mr Cummings' departure from Downing Street, the government has opted to go ahead with Aria, an agency designed to make big bets on risky projects. It will have a tiny fraction of the budget of the existing research agency UKRI, which will carry on doing its job. But Aria will apparently be independent, freed from bureaucracy and imbued with a Silicon Valley culture where failure is not to be feared. The test, of course, will be whether there are also successes to celebrate. Aria will be modelled on the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), which supported research that led to the internet and GPS, and its successor Darpa, which funded the precursors to today's coronavirus vaccines. Science and innovation minister Amanda Solloway said: ""To rise to the challenges of the 21st Century, we need to equip our R&D community with a new scientific engine - one that embraces the idea that truly great successes come from taking great leaps into the unknown."" Recruitment for a chief executive and chair for the agency will begin in the coming weeks. Matthew Fell, CBI UK chief policy director, said the UK had ""a unique opportunity to play to its strength"" with the new agency, to help create jobs, raise productivity and tackle the biggest challenges facing the country. ""Key to Aria's success will be strong business engagement to make sure the brilliant ideas developed can make it through to market,"" he added. Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: ""Engineering is central to an ambitious innovation agency of this kind, forming the bridge between research and innovation to enable technological and commercial breakthroughs."" But Labour shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the agency needed to have a clear mandate and to be subject to Freedom of Information laws, to ensure transparency of funding. ""Labour has long called for investment in high ambition, high risk science,"" he said. ""But government must urgently clarify the mission and mandate of this new organisation, following strong engagement with the UK's science base - those closest to the work.""

'Strong decline' in virus in England since January,"There has been a ""strong decline"" in levels of coronavirus infections in England since January, say scientists tracking the epidemic. Imperial College London's React study found infections have dropped by two-thirds across England since lockdown began, with an 80% fall in London. But virus levels are still high, with one in 200 testing positive between 4 and 13 February. This is similar to levels seen in late September 2020. Although these are interim findings, based on more than 85,000 swab tests from randomly selected people, they suggest social distancing and restrictions are having an impact. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial, said the drop in infection rates was ""really encouraging"". It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. Speaking on Wednesdayhe said it was ""absolutely right"" to take a ""data not dates"" approachto leaving lockdown, and stressed England would ease measures ""cautiously"". In Northern Ireland,ministers have agreed to extend lockdown restrictions to 1 April,although children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school on 8 March. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will make an announcement next week on whether some pupils will return to school. TheWelsh government is due to given an indication of its plansfor coming out of lockdown on Friday. A further 12,057 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, and there have been another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Thursday, 13,494 cases and 678 deaths were reported. The total number of people to have received the first dose of vaccine now stands at 16,423,082 - a daily rise of 482,110. Check case numbers in your area How will we know if the vaccine is working? Explained: How test and trace works According to the Imperial College London team, during early-to-mid-February 0.51% of people in the study tested positive in England, down from 1.57% in early January. In London, positive tests fell from 2.83% to 0.54% over six weeks. The study's author Prof Steven Riley described the fall in cases in London as ""dramatic"" and said there had been ""a strong downward trend since January - better than many hoped for"", which is equivalent to a halving of infections every 15 days. The researchers estimated the R number -the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to- was around 0.72. But more than 20,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital in the UK, and although new daily cases and hospital admissions are falling, they are still relatively high. NHS England figures show 80% of critical care beds were occupied in the week to 14 February, a slight fall from 83% the week before. There are just under 4,800 patients in critical care, with 6,000 beds available. Prof Elliott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Nobody wants to be in lockdown any longer than they have to be but a note of warning - the prevalence rates are still very high. They are as high as they were in September when they were on the increase and the numbers of people in hospital currently are at a level that they were in the first wave so we really have to be cautious."" While the virus is declining in all nine English regions, and substantially in the capital, South East and West Midlands, it is falling less steeply in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. This could be linked to tougher lockdown rules being introduced earlier in London and south-east England after a pre-Christmas surge in cases related to the more transmissible virus variant first discovered in Kent. The latest Public Health England surveillance data also shows case rates have fallen in every region. The East Midlands has the highest rate, 177 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 14 February, but this is down from 228 the previous week. The React report found falls in infections across all age groups, with 18 to 24-year-olds and five to 12-year-olds currently having the highest virus levels - although still below 1%. It estimates the over-65s have the lowest levels of virus at 0.3%. More young children have been attending school during this lockdown than in the last one, which may have helped keep virus levels slightly higher in these age groups. But the researchers stressed opening schools to all children was a high priority and there would have to be a ""trade-off"". Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said in a tweet thatthe results of the React study made ""the strongest case for a phased reopening of schools"",external. A ""big bang"" reopening with the current high rates of infection and hospitalisation would ""jeopardise full and sustained school reopening"", she added. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? The study identified groups that were more likely to test positive - including people of Asian ethnicity, those working in healthcare or care homes, people living in the most deprived areas and those in larger households. Prof Elliott said the study had not seen an impact from the vaccination programme on infections yet, with all age groups seeing a drop in rates, but said the team would keep a ""close eye"" when it had an effect on transmission. The researchers say signs may be visible by the time the final report is released in a matter of weeks, when a larger proportion of people will have been given protection. The report is yet to be peer-reviewed or published.
